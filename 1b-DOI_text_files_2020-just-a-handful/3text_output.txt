this study described two distinct steps (protein homeostasis and inactivation of proteit
associated with normal physiological function) in the csr response to heat stress acros
three distinct tissue types, identifying evidence of disruption to both basic and more
specialized functions. nearly all the enriched biological processes are consistent with
cumulative mortality processes that occur over days and weeks and are related to the
increased costs of migrating in warmer temperatures. among the increased costs are
continued transcription of genes responsible for mitigating the effects of heat stress
(graham et al. 2010) and the reallocation of nutrients and energy from one portion of ai
individual’s resource budget to other metabolic functions, which can be significant
(romero et al., 2009). the indirect involvement of heart contraction processes also sug}

the possibility of a more sudden cause of mortality, the collapse of aerobic scope and fai
of the cardio-respiratory system to deliver adequate oxygen to the brain (farrell et al.,
2008; eliason et al., 2011). mitigation of stressors imposes demands on animals above tl
normally required to sustain life during a life history period already characterized by th
extreme energy demands of upriver migration and reproduction. in this context, it shou
not be surprising that warm water temperatures result in reduction of fitness via decree
reproductive capability and premature mortality that can contribute to population decli
over generations (graham et al., 2010; martin et al., 2010; connon et al., 2018).

subsequent to our thermal exposure experiment, alaska experienced a state-wide patte
of record-breaking heat (summer of 2019) that was associated with geographically
widespread en route mortality of migrating adult pacific salmon across all species (varic
reports available at leonetwork.org and media reports) during a prolonged period of wa
water temperatures akin to our 21°c treatment for several days. results from our study
suggest that unusual mortality in 2019 could have been the result of several proximate
causes of mortality given the wide range of genes and pathways involved. given the
projections of continued warming across the northern range extent of pacific salmon (
et al., 2019), the cellular heat stress response described here will likely become more
common in the wild.

this research demonstrates the broad effects of temperature stress on pacific salmon

physiology and underscores the importance of analyzing multiple tissues for determing

hsp70 induction confirmed a heat stress response in the 21°c treatment. the magnitud
response was greatest in the liver, followed by the muscle and then gill. there was also
substantially more variation in the gill. tissue-dependent responses are common in
biomarkers of cellular stress as each tissue has specialized functions. the reduced respc
in gill tissue hsp70 is at odds with a number of other studies that have used heat stress
biomarkers in gill (iwama, 1999; jeffries et al., 2013; tomalty et al., 2015; akbarzadeh et
2018). it is unclear if a longer heat stress exposure or longer time course prior to tissue

2018). itis unclear if a longer heat stress exposure or longer time course prior to tissue
sampling may have resulted in a more distinct heat stress response in gill tissue. respo
timing of hsp70 protein is known to be tissue specific with longer delays in gill tissue
(lewis et al., 2016). chinook salmon held in the 18°c treatment did not demonstrate a
significant elevation in hsp7o protein in any tissue type after a 4 h treatment. still, hsi
proteins were elevated in migrating adult chinook salmon that had recently experience
maximum water temperatures 218°c, likely for periods longer than 4 h or more than 4 i
prior. it appears likely that the experimental time course (4, h) was not long enough for
hsp70 protein response to be apparent in our 18°c treatment, whereas mrna levels we
more rapidly upregulated as demonstrated by the substantial number of protein folding
genes upregulated within 4 h at 18°c.

transcriptome response preceding hsp7o protein increase in 18°c chinook salmon

the transcriptome of 18°c treated chinook salmon revealed a distinct, but relatively nai
set of enriched biological processes broadly associated with protein processing and

cell/tissue homeostasis (fig. 3, appendix 1). often changes in the enrichment of biologi
processes involved in the csr can begin to be detected at temperatures below where wh
organism effects can be observed (jeffries et al., 2012). the major transcriptional overla
functional response to 18°c exposures across tissues was protein folding, consistent wit
other studies (iwama et al.. 1999: basu et al. 2002: huang et al.. 2018). although hsp90

functional response to 18°c exposures across tissues was protein folding, consistent wit
other studies (iwama et al., 1999; basu et al., 2002; huang et al., 2018). although hsp90
gene transcripts were identified as differentially transcribed between 18°c and control f
hsp70 gene transcripts were not.

enriched biological processes specific to gill tissue in 18°c treated salmon were the sma
protein signal transduction and cell aging superclusters. smad signal transduction is
involved with cell proliferation, differentiation and death (moustakas et al., 2001) and is
associated with production of hsp90 (yan et al., 2018). cell aging and oxidative stress a

the primary supercluster associated with liver in salmon exposed to 18°c was negative
regulation of transcription—dna templated. this, in effect, describes transcriptomic
plasticity, which has been associated with survival outcomes in fish subjected to chroni
and acute stress (logan and buckley, 2015; wellband and heath, 2017).

similarities in heat stress response across tissues in 21°c chinook salmon

several biological processes associated with protein processing in the cell’s er consiste!
with other studies (iwama et al., 1999; basu et al., 2002; huang et al., 2018). the hsp70 «
hsp90 genes were responsive across all tissue types examined as expected given that th
resulting chaperone proteins bind to misfolded proteins and are the most well-known
component of the cell’s protein processing response to heat stress (iwama et al., 1999; i
et al., 2002). indeed, this study relied on the elevation of the hsp70 protein to confirm t
heat stress had occurred. our whole transcriptome approach provided a more complete
picture of the heat stress response in the er and revealed that most key genes relating t
function of the er were upregulated in the 21°c fish. these included lumenal chaperone
promote correct protein folding such as protein disulphide isomerase and dnaj and bip
(huang et al., 2018; rebl et al., 2018), which deliver misfolded proteins for ubiquitin-
dependent degradation (plemper et al., 1997). ubiquitin is key to degradation of misfold

proteins, which, when accumulated, can impair er function and lead to cell death
(goldberg, 2003), altered expression of genes (ubiquitin, nuclear factor erythroid 2-rel.
factor 2, ero-1) playing key roles in maintaining the redox state within cells were also
identified (ramsden and gallagher, 2016). the down-regulation of key genes in the
mitigation of heat stress in our study (ate-6 alpha, ubiquitin, nuclear factor erythroid
related factor 2) may suggest that these salmon were transitioning from adaptive
regulation to injury in response to heat stress (xia et al., 2017).

tissue-specific responses to heat stress in 21°c chinook salmon

global ge patterns indicate that transcriptomic responses to heat stress were highly tis
specific (fig. 3). tissue-specific responses likely relate to the specific physiological role
each tissue in the fish, a phenomenon that has been found in other studies of heat stres:
ectotherms (dietz and somero, 1993; buckley and somero, 2008; nuez-ortin et al., 2018
additionally, it has been hypothesized that the specialized functions of different tissues
could make some tissues more or less susceptible to disruptions from heat stress (guist
et al., 2013). the most significant superclusters of biological processes associated with ¢
tissue type are discussed below.

gill response to heat stress in 21°c chinook salmon

gill tissue supports spawning by moving oxygen from the water to the blood stream for
delivery throughout the body. the gill is also involved in ion and water regulation, acid-
base balance and nitrogenous waste (ammonia) excretion. in gill tissue we identified an
enrichment of processes associated broadly with positive regulation of dna damage
response and signal transduction by ps3 class mediator and telomere maintenance by
telomerase (fig. 3). positive regulation of dna damage response and signal transductio
p53 class mediator is a supercluster of biological processes associated with mitigation o
dna damage [dna damage responses (ddr)]. in studies on juvenile chinook salmon,
tomalty et al. (2015) found similar enrichment of ddr processes in fish exposed to
increased temperatures. studies on heat stress in pufferfish (takifugu obscurus) and cok
stress in tilapia (oreochromis niloticus) and zebrafish (danio rerio) have also identified
enrichment of ddr processes (cheng et al., 2018; hu et al., 2016) suggesting that ddr
response are common when fish encounter unsuitable water temperatures.

enriched biological processes included telomere maintenance by telomerase. telomere

although causal relationships among temperature, growth, oxidative stress and cross~

siberian sturgeon (acipenser baerii) exposed to increased temperatures had 15% shorter
telomeres. however, few studies have explored the causal relationship between stress a

2013).

liver response to heat stress in 21°c chinook salmon

 

the primary role of the liver in adult migrating salmon is likely mobilizing and
metabolizing stored lipid resources as fuel (johnson et al., 2013). several enriched biolo;
processes in the liver tissue of 21°c fish were related to responses to virus, potentially
indicative of latent viral infection at the population level. these biological processes
included activation of interferon gamma (ifny) production as well as involvement of m
histocompatibility complex class i, both considered hallmarks of defence against viruse
(goldsby, 2003). miller et al. (2011) found an intensification of inflammatory, apoptotic

muscle response to heat stress in 21°c chinook salmon

skeletal muscle is the major locomotor tissue that propels salmon upstream to their
spawning grounds. in muscle tissue we identified enriched biological processes associat
broadly with phosphatidylinositol metabolism, regulation of the force of heart contract
(including cardiac muscle hypertrophy in response to stress), positive regulation of rea
oxygen species biosynthesis and protein folding. phosphatidylinositol metabolism refle

et al., 2018). a shift toward amino acid use during upstream migration of adults has
previously been indicated in the gill tissue of juvenile chinook salmon (tomalty et al., 2
increasing water temperatures cause an increase in metabolic rate, leading to a state of
metabolic remodelling to compensate for increased energy demand and an increased
energy deficit induced under elevated temperatures, potentially shifting to an increase
dependence on amino acids rather than glucose (e.g. reliance on metabolism of muscles
rather than fat) (kullgren et al., 2013; nuez-ortin et al., 2018).

surprisingly, many of the enriched biological processes in the white skeletal muscle of
stressed fish were related to regulation of the force of heart contraction (cardiac muscle

phosphorylation of structural genes and proteins (jorgensen et al., 2014). cardiac collay

homeostasis; fig. 1). second, a comparison between control and 21°c treated chinook
salmon elucidates the heat stress response that occurs following the elevation of the hs
protein response (inactivation of proteins associated with normal physiological functio
fig. 1). the transcriptome response within each of these phases was distinct with a mor
narrowly defined 18°c response focused on altered protein processing (similar among,
tissues) in contrast to the 21°c response that was characterized by alterations to a wide
diversity of biological processes within and specific to each tissue type examined. it sho
be noted that fish experienced gill netting and handling that may have resulted in
alterations in ge. since all of the fish, including controls, experienced the same level of
disturbance, this should not have been an important factor in discovering temperature
related differences in ge. we cannot rule out the possibility, however, that some of the
differences in ge that we observed is an interaction with temperature and prior handlin
stress.

we identified a lack of broad-scale diversity of enriched biological processes in the
transcriptome responses of fish held at 18°c across all three tissues (fig. 3); many proce
were associated with cellular processing (quinn et al., 2011). however, transcriptome re

transcriptome responses of fish held at 18°c across all three tissues (fig, 3); many proce
were associated with cellular processing (quinn et al., 2011). however, transcriptome re
from the three tissues of fish held in 21°c water identified alterations in diverse cellular
processes (dna damage and telomere maintenance in the gill; protein folding in all
tissues), immune challenges (liver tissue), and more specific changes in energy sources
muscle tissue and heart function (muscle tissue). our results align with findings in stud
of other pacific salmon species and ectotherms (akbarzadeh et al., 2018; mesa et al., 20¢
tomalty et al., 2015; miller et al., 2009; jeffries et al., 2012; jeffries et al., 2014a). the onl
biological process influenced by heat stress across all sampled tissue types was protein
folding. alterations in protein folding are a hallmark heat stress response that includes
hsp chaperones (wali and balkthi, 2016).

individually, fish were placed in one of three 587-l oval polyethylene stock tanks (high
country plastics, model w-155) filled with river water at ambient temperature (~14°c)
short acclimation period of at least 30 min before water was warmed in two of the tanks
either a low-heat (mean of 18°c) or high-heat (mean of 21°c) temperature treatment. i
order to minimize potential stress from conditions in the field (i.e. confinement) we use
acclimation time shorter than that normally used in controlled laboratory experiments.
low- and high-heat temperatures were selected for this study based on the available
literature for heat stress in salmonids (miller et al., 2009; strange, 2010; hasler et al., 2¢
hinch et al., 2012; jeffries et al., 2014a) which already occur with some frequency in the
watershed. the low-heat treatment temperature of 18°c is near the threshold for detect
thermal stress, and the high-heat treatment temperature of 21°c is likely near the uppe
temperature limit for migrating chinook salmon (mccullough, 1999). the target rate of
heating for the low- and high-heat stress trials was 4°c hr * to minimize total fish hold

thermal stress, and the high-heat treatment temperature of 21°c is likely near the uppe
temperature limit for migrating chinook salmon (mccullough, 1999). the target rate of
heating for the low- and high-heat stress trials was 4°c hr * to minimize total fish hold
time out of concern that prolonged confinement would reduce survival. this rate of
temperature increase has been used in other heat stress studies in chinook salmon (cla
al., 2008) andis similar to a temperature shift that a salmon would experience when
moving between water masses such as the transition from marine waters in the bering:
to river waters in western alaska or a transition from the mainstem yukon river to a
tributary (martin et al. 1986). indeed, pacific salmon routinely move across thermally
heterogenous habitats at the surface and with depth including watersheds with tempers
differences of up to 7°c between rivers (goniea et al., 2006; keefer et al., 2015) and diurr
vertical migrations associated with abrupt water temperature shifts of 8°c (roscoe et al
2010). temperatures in control and treatment tanks were maintained within narrow rat
that did not overlap among control (12.9-15.9°c; mean, 14.4°c), low-stress (17.3—18.6%
mean, 18.0°c) and high-stress treatments (19.8-22.0°c; mean, 20.9°c) following the
warming period.

all individuals in the control and low-heat groups survived to the end of the trial, but o

likely related to water temperatures being near the upper thermal limit for migrating
chinook salmon (mccullough, 1999) and is discussed in more detail in donnelly et al. (i
press). the length of the 22 chinook salmon that survived the experiment ranged from
to 879 mm (mid-eye to fork measurement) with a mean length of 733 mm (sd, 110 mm.
fish were upstream migrating adults including a single precocial male.

all fish were sacrificed immediately prior to tissue sampling at the end of the four-hour
target-temperature period. gill, muscle and liver tissues were collected from each fish,
placed immediately into a cryovial and stored in a dry shipper supercooled with liquid
nitrogen. the samples were kept at -80°c from 25 june 2018 until 10 july 2018 then
transported via dry shipper to university of california at davis where they were stored a

yukon river chinook salmon (oncorhynchus tshawytscha) and subsequently determine t
mechanisms causing the relationships between temperature and csr. air and water
temperatures have been warming throughout alaska (hinzman et al., 2005; kocan et al.
2009) with summer water temperatures in the yukon river and tributaries often exceed
18°c and occasionally approaching or exceeding 20°c (zuray et al., 2012; carlson and
edwards, 2017). chinook salmon declines are widespread in the arctic-yukon—kuskokt
region and prompted the alaska board of fisheries to classify yukon river chinook saln
as a ‘stock of yield concern’ beginning in 2000 (krueger and zimmerman, 2009). cool v
refuges are less likely in well-mixed rivers such as the yukon river (zuray et al., 2012;
jensen et al., 2013) and provide less opportunity for behavioural adaptation that occurs |
other systems (mathes et al., 2010; hasler et al., 2012). pre-spawning mortality, en route
mortality and negative sublethal effects on migrating adult salmon can be very high wh
conditions approach or are within the upper thermal limits (keefer et al., 2018; mathes
al., 2010; hinch et al., 2012; jeffries et al., 2014a; teffer et al., 2018). mortality can exceec

herein, we describe the use of a gene-based diagnostic, rnaseq, to identify the

examining the csr of heat stress in adult chinook salmon were found in the literature. (
objectives were to conduct a thermal exposure experiment, its efficacy validated by heat
shock protein 70 (hsp70) induction, (basu et al., 2002), and subsequently elucidate
potential causes of premature mortality resulting from acute exposure to elevated
temperature in migrating adult yukon river chinook salmon.

one of the most dramatic changes to freshwater habitats has been increases in water
temperatures (hinzman et al., 2005; crozier et al., 2008; kaushal et al., 2010). pacific
salmon (oncorhynchus spp.) are cold-water species with adult life stages that are
particularly sensitive to high water temperatures during spawning migrations
(mccullough, 1999; pértner and farrell, 2008). upper thermal limits for induction of
negative effects in migrating adult pacific salmon are in the range of 18°c to 23°c
(mccullough, 1999; strange, 2010). even sublethal elevated temperatures can influence
salmon biology, including effects on metabolism, susceptibility to disease, acceleration
senescence and timing of life history events such as upstream migration and spawning
(jeffries et al., 2014a; groot and margolis, 1991; carter, 2005). temperature impacts are
thought to be cumulative and positively correlated to the duration and severity of the

thought to be cumulative and positively correlated to the duration and severity of the
exposure, potentially reducing survival to spawning (elliott, 1981). as salmon do not fe¢
during their spawning migrations, they must enter rivers with all the energy reserves
needed to reach their spawning grounds (brett, 1995). high temperatures and associate
increases in metabolic rates put salmon at risk of energy depletion and mortality before
reaching spawning grounds as warmer temperatures result in higher energy use (hasle
al., 2012).

gene transcription is the process by which information from the dna template of a
particular gene is transcribed into messenger rna (mrna) and eventually translated in
functional protein. the amount of mrna of a particular gene is dictated by a number of
extrinsic and intrinsic factors, including stimuli such as heat stress, infectious agents, t
exposure, trauma or malignant transformation (bowen et al., 2012). untangling the
complex web of direct and indirect physiological effects of heat stress on salmon can be
assisted by examining transcription of genes associated with multiple biological proces
including immune function, protein folding, protein synthesis, metabolism, oxidative
stress and ion transport, all of which are affected by high water temperatures (akbarza¢
et al., 2018; mesa et al., 2002; tomalty et al., 2015; miller et al., 2009; jeffries et al., 2012;
jeffries et al., 2014a). moreover, the alteration of transcription can be predictive of mort
prior to spawning (miller et al., 2011; jeffries et al., 2012).

prior to spawning (miller et al., 2011; jeffries et al., 2012).

heat stress triggers a range of adaptive physiological and cellular mechanisms, includir
the cellular stress response (csr), a ‘tiered’ response, with early and later phase chang’
gene expression (ge) that appears to be conserved among all vertebrates (logan and
buckley, 2015) (fig. 1). the csr facilitates the protection of cellular macromolecules
through molecular chaperoning, the reallocation of metabolic resources away from
homeostatic functions and toward stress responses, the reversible arrest of the cell cycl
and, in cases of more extreme stress, programmed cell death through apoptosis (logan
buckley, 2015). a key component of the csr to heat stress is the induction of heat shock
proteins (hsps) which re-fold heat damaged proteins and prevent their cytotoxic
aggregation to protect against cellular damage and death (logan and buckley, 2015;
bouchama et al., 2017; shi et al., 2019). identification and characterization of temperatu
induced csr will identify genes for monitoring heat stress and aid in understanding the
mechanisms linking sublethal temperatures to premature mortality (jeffries et al., 2014
premature mortality is the sum of en route mortality in migration corridors and prespav
mortality on the spawning grounds.

abstract

chinook salmon (oncorhynchus tshawytscha) declines are widespread and may be
attributed, at least in part, to warming river temperatures. water temperatures in the
yukon river and tributaries often exceed 18°c, a threshold commonly associated witt
heat stress and elevated mortality in pacific salmon. untangling the complex web of
direct and indirect physiological effects of heat stress on salmon is difficult ina
natural setting with innumerable system challenges but is necessary to increase our
understanding of both lethal and sublethal impacts of heat stress on populations. thi
goal of this study was to characterize the cellular stress response in multiple chinook
salmon tissues after acute elevated temperature challenges. we conducted a controll
4-hour temperature exposure (control, 18°c and 21°c) experiment on the bank of the
yukon river followed by gene expression (ge) profiling using a 3'~tag-rna-seq

salmon tissues after acute elevated temperature challenges. we conducted a controll
4-hour temperature exposure (control, 18°c and 21°c) experiment on the bank of the
yukon river followed by gene expression (ge) profiling using a 3'~tag-rna-seq
protocol. the full transcriptome was analysed for 22 chinook salmon in muscle, gill
and liver tissue. both the 21°c and 18°c treatments induced greater activity in genes
associated with protein folding (e.g. hsp70, hsp90 mrna) processes in all tissues.
global ge patterns indicate that transcriptomic responses to heat stress were highly
tissue-specific, underscoring the importance of analyzing multiple tissues for
determination of physiological effect. primary superclusters (ie. groupings of loosely
related terms) of altered biological processes were identified in each tissue type,
including regulation of dna damage response (gill), regulation by host of viral
transcription (liver) and regulation of the force of heart contraction (muscle) in the
21°c treatment. this study provides insight into mechanisms potentially affecting
adult chinook salmon as they encounter warm water during their spawning migratio
in the yukon river and suggests that both basic and more specialized cellular
functions may be disrupted.
