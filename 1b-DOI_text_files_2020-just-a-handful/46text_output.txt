we have developed riprap, a new method for identifying rna structural disruption ind
by snvs. riprap maximizes a novel structural disruption score over alll possible local
regions around an snv. we compared riprap with existing computational methods on
established ribosnitch benchmark datasets. we demonstrated improved performance o
riprap on identifying known ribosnitches. in addition, we showed that riprap can dete
the focal regions of structural disruption by applying riprap to the dataset of human cc
haplotypes.

riprap provides a novel metric by combining the magnitude and statistical significance
structural differences, which detects the consistent changes of bpps in focal regions. w
showed that measuring the consistent structural alterations of consecutive bases
outperforms summarizing the differences of individual bases as did in other existing

methods. although the pars benchmarks were constructed bv comparing the pars sco!
suuctufdl aliferences, wnicn getecrs tne consistent changes of bpps in local regions. w

showed that measuring the consistent structural alterations of consecutive bases
outperforms summarizing the differences of individual bases as did in other existing
methods. although the pars benchmarks were constructed by comparing the pars sco
5 nt around the snvs (22), we found the performance of riprap is robust at different
minimum window size settings. even though the difference of the accuracies for riprap
simple and rnasnp on the ‘validated’ and ‘symmetric’ ribosnitches is not as high as th
on the ‘probed’ ribosnitches, the fact that the difference follows the rigorousness of th
benchmark datasets demonstrates the ability of riprap on identifying high-confident
ribosnitches. in the current version of riprap, we implemented the score cutoff determ
in the dataset that includes the most rigorously validated ribosnitches (‘probed’ datase
pars data) as the threshold to call a ribosnitch. the performance of riprap with the sc«
cutoff is similar to that with the threshold determined by the method of corley et al. (23
both ‘validated’ and ‘symmetric’ ribosnitches (supplementary table $1), which indicat
the robustness of the score cutoff.

the structural disruption scores and regions outputted by riprap are consistent for
computationally and experimentally derived base pairing measurements. it suggests th
riprap may be used to leverage existing rna folding algorithms (e.g. rnafold, unafolk
(28), rnastructure (25) and sfold (47), etc.), as well as experimental measurements
(e.g. shape (21), pars (22,48) and their derivatives (/,9,50)) to detect ribosnitches and
structurally disrupted regions. in addition, reconstructed rna structures from high-

 

 

   

(28) ] rnastructure (25) and sfold (47), ete. iv as well as experimental measurements
(e.g. shape (21), pars (22,48) and their derivatives (4.9,50)) to detect ribosnitches and
structurally disrupted regions. in addition, reconstructed rna structures from high-
throughput experimental assays (51,52) can be incorporated into riprap to further imp:
the identification of ribosnitches.

riprap focuses on detecting the focal regions around ribosnitches that disrupt rna
structures, some ribosnitches may cause long-range changes in rna structure. for
example, a newly discovered, clinically relevant ribosnitch in the 3' utr of ekbp5 was
reported to alter the structure and the efficiency of microrna binding located at ~140 b
upstream regions (53). the current implementation of riprap is designed to detect the
region of structural disruption using scanning windows that include the snv position. 1
design scheme will likely decrease the disruption score of a long-distance structure cha
by including the unchanged regions between the region and the snv site. we will exten
riprap to accurately detect distantly located structure alteration regions related toa
ribosnitch in future studies.

riprap can be applied to analyze snvs genome-wide. in addition, riprap can be used to
snvs with rna functions, such as stability, degradation, translation or splicing. riprap
also be incorporated into gwas studies to provide functional annotation, interpretation
and prioritization of genetic variants associated with diseases, behaviors, and other

phenotypes. our database, ribosnitchdb, consists of both experimentally validated an

annotation also makes it available to study human diseases from a rna secondary struc

with radiation complications and rectal cancer (4./,,4.5). we show that there are 35 distin
rbps in 12 different cell lines that bind within upstream 100 nt to downstream 100 nt
around the position of rs1051677 (supplementary figure $5a), which reveals the possibi
that this ribosnitch affects the rbp binding via altering the structure. users can also
visualize the nucleotide sequence, bppm and the mfe structure of both the wt and mut
sequence, as well as the structure-disrupted region (supplementary figure $5b—d). in
addition to the ribosnitches detected experimentally, we also included the predicted
ribosnitches that are associated with gene expression. to identify them, we used ripra,
44.170 transcriptomic eqtls from the gtex (/,6) database (see ‘materials and methods

nackley et al. reported that human comt haplotypes, associated with pain sensitivity,
regulate protein expression by altering mrna secondary structure (12). the authors fou
there are two synonymous (rs4633 and rs4818), and one non-synonymous (rs4680) sn
that contribute to pain sensitivity phenotypes by modulating the comt enzymatic activ
and protein expression. specifically, rs4818, one of the synonymous snvs that can alter
mrnas’ secondary structure, results in the largest reduction among the haplotypes in t
enzymatic activity and protein expression. this study encouraged us to evaluate riprap
differentiating these well-studied snvs. we applied riprap to the three snvs within tw:
comt mrnas that encodes two distinct proteins: s-comt and mb-comt (figure 6a, s
details in ‘materials and methods’ section). we found that rs4818 obtained significantly
higher riprap score compared to rs4633 and rs4680, with p-value equal to 0.04 and 0.0
respectively (figure 6b), which shows that riprap successfully captured this
experimentally-validated ribosnitch. in addition, riprap identifies that the structural
disruption region of rs4818 is from the 635th to the 699th nucleotide and from the 2nd
the 490th nucleotide in mb-comt and $-comt, respectively (figure 6c and
supplementary figure $4). nackley et al. experimentally demonstrated that the critical
region whose secondary structure contributes to the largest difference in comt haploty
is from the 625th to the 701st nucleotide and from the 403rd to the 479th nucleotide in
comt and s-comt, respectively (12), which significantly overlap with those reported b
riprap (hypergeometric test p-value equal to 2.1e-114 and 1.6e-50 for mb-comt and s-
comt, respectively). these results not only validate riprap's predictions experimental

but also indicate that riprap is potentially applicable to detecting pathogenic ribosnitc!
in the human genome.
furthermore, we applied riprap to two snvs that were associated with the
hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome and were probed by shape (21) (figure 5b and c)
the two snvs are located in the 5' utr of the ftl gene close to the known iron respons'
element (ire). strikingly, although the coordinates of both snvs do not overlap with th
ire, the structurally disrupted regions predicted by riprap for both snvs covered and
centered on the ire (figure 5b and c). as a negative control, we also applied riprap to
another snv which was demonstrated to have no structural change effect on ftl (20). \
found that this mutation is predicted as a non-ribosnitch by riprap, which is validated
the similar profiles between the wt and mutant sequences in terms of both shape
reactivities and bpps (figure 5d). this analysis supported a proposed mechanism that
mutations outside of the ire may disrupt its structure and subsequent interaction with
ire-binding protein (20).

to further demonstrate the practical merit of our method, we compared riprap with sd

437 snvs with shape reactivity data (31). sdc is a global approach based on whole sequ
correlations between the wt and mutant structural profiles (21) (described in ‘material
and methods’ section), which cannot determine the boundaries of structurally disrupte
regions. we calculated the esdc score and predicted sdc score (psdc) (21), as well as th
experimental riprap score (eriprap) and predicted riprap score (priprap) for these snv
(described in ‘materials and methods’ section). the esdc and eriprap scores of these 43
snvs served as the benchmarks for their psdc and priprap scores, respectively. we first
specified experimentally true positive and true negative sets with equal size of n based
esdc and eriprap scores for sdc and riprap, respectively. we then generated rocs usin;
psdc and priprap scores. next, we calculated the corresponding aucs for multiple choic
n. as shown in figure 5a, the prediction performance of priprap on eriprap increases as
decreases, suggesting the higher validity of the top ribosnitches measured by eriprap.
pattern is expected when priprap is consistent with eriprap. however, the aucs of psdc
fluctuate when n increases, suggesting that psdc is less consistent with esdc (figure 5!
addition, priprap has much better prediction accuracy on eriprap than psdc on esdc for
top ribosnitches (figure 5a), which shows the advantage of measuring snv-induced
structural disruption by local metrics embedded in riprap. as stated by corley et al. (23)
local predictors of structural changes perform in general better than global approaches
therefore, to further investigate the performance of sdc, we constructed a local sdc m

as expected, riprap and rnasnp, taking advantage of the local measurement, both
outperform the other methods on the most rigorously validated benchmark dataset. th
better performance of riprap compared to rnasnp presumably results from the
combination of both the magnitude and the statistical significance in the differential
analysis, which is shown in supplementary figure si. we then investigated why riprap
achieves better performance than rnasnp as a local measurement by dissecting the
identified regions by riprap and rnasnp. to call ribosnitches, we established a cutoff
similar to corley et al. (23). specifically, we used the point closest to the top left corner ¢
the roc curve for the ‘probed’ dataset. if the calculated riprap score is not less than the
cutoff, we report the corresponding snv as a ribosnitch. we compared the false negativ
(ens) and false positives (fps) of riprap with those of rnasnp. riprap has only one fn.
two eps, which were also wrongly predicted by rnasnp. as comparison, rnasnp has th
more fns and one more fps than riprap (figure 34). one can see that riprap identified
three-base region around 81050818, indicating its ability to detect the structurally
disrupted regions of ribosnitches at base resolution (figure 3b). in rs1047993 and
151051677, although the magnitudes of the structural change are subtle, they were capt
by riprap as the significance test p-values of the regional structural change were small
(3.0e-3 and 8.1e~7) (figure 3c and d). it indicates the advantage of taking both the

riprap, to generate the input bppms of the wt and mutant mrna sequences in these
datasets, we compared riprap with five other existing methods for ribosnitch
identification. the first method we considered is based on the simple euclidean distance
the bppms, denoted by ‘simple’. the second method we considered is rnasnp (19) (ver
1.1), which is based on the largest euclidean distance of the bpps of all regions that are
larger than 10 bases (we used -1 10). to accurately measure the structure disruption, we
used the dmax output of rnasnp (19) as the score to be compared. the third method is
classsnitch (4,2) (version 1.0), which builds a classifier based on training data from sha
datasets using features that imitate the judgement of human beings on structural chan;
the fourth and fifth methods are remurna (26) and snpfold (17) (version 1.01) tested i
corley et al, (23). we listed the commands for each method in supplementary table $2."
applied the proposed riprap approach and the five existing methods to aforementioned
benchmark datasets. we generated the roc curves and calculated the area under curve
(auc) values for the six methods being compared on the three datasets (table 1). one cz
see that riprap has the highest auc values among all the methods being compared ona

the three benchmark datasets. the aucs of riprap differentiate the benchmark dataset:
with increased values in the order of ‘symmetric’, ‘validated? and ‘probed’ ribosnitche:
which are consistent with the increasing levels of rigorousness in constructing these
benchmark datasets (23). to test whether the prediction performances are better than
random guessing (auc = 0.5), we employed the mann-whitney test for statistical
significance. the aucs of riprap on the ‘probed? (0.868), ‘validated? (0.642) and
‘symmetric’ (0.585) datasets are significantly higher than 0.5 with much lower p-value
compared to those of simple, rnasnp and classsnitch (figure 2a~c). since rnasnp als
outputs an empirical p-value for the distance score, we examined the performance of tt
value as well. we found that riprap outperforms rnasnp no matter which metric in rn.
was used (table 1). if we apply the conventional p-value cutoff 0.05 to rnasnp for the
ribosnitch detection, the method fails to detect any ribosnitch in the ‘probed’ dataset
(supplementary table $1), which suggests that it might not be a good strategy to call
ribosnitches based on the p-value provided by rnasnp. to note, classsnitch was origir
designed for analyzing shape data instead of the bpp profiles, so it is as expected that
have observed the lower performance in classsnitch on this dataset.

we design a database for ribosnitch annotation and visualization, called ribosnitchdb
which can be accessed via http: //people.umass.edu/ouyanglab/ribosnitchdb/. ribosnite
includes not only all the experimentally validated ribosnitches presented in this study,
also the in silico predicted ribosnitches in human eqil datasets. we collect the annotat
of the deposited ribosnitches based on the following databases: rbp binding sites
downloaded from postar2 (38) (http: //lulab.life.tsinghua.edu.en/postar/), mirna
targeting sites downloaded from ucsc table browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-

(39) (http://m6avar.renlab.org/), and clinical significance downloaded from clinvar (2’
(https: //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/).

to detect ribosnitches in eqtls, we download the eqtl datasets from the genotype-ti
(39) (http://moavar.renlab.org/), and clinical signiticance downloaded trom clinvar (27
(https: //www.ncbinlm.nih.gov/clinvar/).

to detect ribosnitches in eqtls, we download the eqtl datasets from the genotype-ti
expression (gtex) database (/,0) (hnttps://www.gtexportal.org/home/) and the hg1g re
annotation from the ucsc table browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgtables).
after excluding snvs with multiple substitutions, we filter out the eqtls in intronic an
intergenic regions and keep those eqtls that are located in mrnas, which result in 44
eqtls in total. we download the genomic region annotation of the snvs from the dbsn
database (41) (https: //www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/snp/).
the experimental disruption score and the predicted disruption
score

the structural disruption coefficient (sdc) was proposed to measure the global struct
disruption of an snv on the entire rna sequence (21). the experimental sdc (esdc),
calculated from the shape probing reactivities of the entire rna sequence, has been us
evaluate the ability of existing rna folding algorithms for detecting ribosnitches. it is
shown that the predicted sdc (psdc), based on in silico bpps of the entire rna sequenc
has insufficient accuracy of predicting esdcs (21).

here, we define the experimental score (eriprap) as the structural disruption score of
riprap applied to shape probing reactivities, and the predicted score (priprap) as the
structural disruption score of riprap applied to in silico bpps. we calculate the priprap a
psdc scores using the same predicted bpps from the rna folding algorithm rnafold in
viennarna package 2.0 (37). similarly, we use the same shape reactivity dataset as

psdc scores using the same predicted bpps from the rna folding algorithm rnafold in
viennarna package 2.0 (37). similarly, we use the same shape reactivity dataset as
described above to calculate the eriprap and esdc scores.

 

to modify sdc for measuring the structure disruption locally, we calculated the local es
and the local psdc as the largest esdc and psdc value among those of all the subsequen
of the input sequence, respectively.
datasets collection

we evaluate the prediction performance of riprap and other existing algorithms using
benchmarks from the pars (22) and the shape (31) studies. the pars study includes a
dataset of non-redundant ribosnitches and non-ribosnitches compiled by corley et al.
ina family trio of human lymphoblastoid cell lines (22). the pars dataset contains

the ‘probed’ subset contains the most rigorously validated ribosnitches that were
confirmed using chemical probing, an orthogonal rna structure mapping method. the
‘validated’ subset includes those validated by allele-specific mapping of the family trio.
‘symmetric’ subset represents those congruously detected as ribosnitches in each of th
pairwise comparisons between the father, the mother and the child in the family trio. t
dataset also contains 835 ‘asymmetric’ ribosnitches that are differently indicated as

overview of the riprap framework

riprap contains three steps for ribosnitch identification (figure 1): first, we employ ger
rna folding algorithms to generate bpps representing rna conformation profiles of a
given pair of wt and mutant rnas that differ by an snv. the rna folding algorithms w
use include rnafold (24), rnastructure (25) and unafold (28). riprap provides the opt
for users to select one of the three aforementioned folding algorithms in calculating the
bpps. second, we perform differential analyses of the bps between the wt and mutant
rnas for all possible local regions around the snv. the local regions we consider are fr
window of three bases to the full sequence length, where the minimum size of the wind
is adjustable. third, we derive structural disruption scores (named as riprap scores) ba
on the differential analyses, and report the largest score and the corresponding local re

ribosnitch, an snv located in an rna that alters its secondary structure, has the potent
to influence rna biogenesis and regulation (1~5). ribosnitch exists in diverse types of
sequences, including trnas (6,7), micrornas (8-10), coding sequences (11-13), as well
5! and 3' untranslated regions (utrs) (14,18). ribosnitch is also emerging in genome-

while experimental approaches to identifying ribosnitches (21,22) are time-consuminy
computational prediction of ribosnitches is still challenging (23). the general rna fold
algorithms, such as rnafold (24) and rnastructure (25), combined with a dissimilarity
metric, can be applied to measure the structural difference between two rna sequences
(23). in the dissimilarity calculation, it has been reported that utilizing the base pairing
probabilities (bpps) of rna structure ensembles rather than the binary output of paire¢
unpaired states from minimum free energy rna structures can achieve better performa
in ribosnitch prediction (19,23). recently developed algorithms that intrinsically comp
rna structures between two rna sequences improve the ribosnitch detection accuracy
(23). in particular, snpfold (17) calculates the pearson correlation coefficient; remurnt
(26) compares the relative entropies; and rnasnp (19) provides both euclidian distance
pearson's correlation measurement. in general, algorithms that consider local instead
global structural change perform better in the prediction (23). even though algorithms
designed specifically for predicting ribosnitches outperform general rna folding
algorithms, the accuracy of ribosnitch prediction is far from perfect (23). in addition, it
been reported that the design of the metric used to measure rna structural variation is
reason of the better performance of the specialized methods (23).

existing methods on established experimental benchmarks from various types of rna
structure probing assays including parallel analysis of rna structure (pars) (22) and
shape (21). we also apply riprap to a specific dataset of snvs that regulate human
catechol-o-methyltransferase (comt) haplotypes and verified that riprap can detect
pathogenic ribosnitches. in addition, we present ribosnitchdb, a comprehensive datat

whether they co-localize with rna binding protein (rbp) binding sites, mirna targetir
sites, and n°-methyladenosine (m°a) modification sites, as well as whether they are
associated with diseases in clinvar database (27).

abstract

rna conformational alteration has significant impacts on cellular processes and
phenotypic variations. an emerging genetic factor of rna conformational alteration
a new class of single nucleotide variant (snv) named ribosnitch. ribosnitches have
been demonstrated to be involved in many genetic diseases. however, identifying
ribosnitches is notably difficult as the signals of rna structural disruption are often
subtle. here, we introduce a novel computational framework-ribosnitch predictor
based on robust analysis of pairing probabilities (riprap). riprap identifies
structurally disrupted regions around any given snvs based on robust analysis of loc
structural configurations between wild-type and mutant rna sequences. compared |
previous approaches, riprap shows higher accuracy when assessed on hundreds

of known ribosnitches captured by various experimental rna structure probing,
methods including the parallel analysis of rna structure (pars) and the selective 2'-
hydroxyl acylation analyzed by primer extension (shape). further, riprap detects th
experimentally validated ribosnitch that regulates human catechol-o-
methyltransferase haplotypes and outputs structurally disrupted regions precisely at
base resolution. riprap provides a new approach to interpreting disease-related
genetic variants. in addition, we construct a database (ribosnitchdb) that includes t
annotation and visualization of al presented ribosnitches in this study as well 5 24

base resolution. riprap provides a new approach to interpreting disease-related
genetic variants. in addition, we construct a database (ribosnitchdb) that includes t
annotation and visualization of all presented ribosnitches in this study as well as 24
629 predicted ribosnitches from human expression quantitative trait loci.
