we collected the eclip data and differential expression analysis results from the
encode consortium [33,34]. we included the accession numbers in the

rna-seq data, respectively.

pras

pras is a newly developed tool for eclip-seq analysis, which integrates the
intensities and positions of the binding peaks of rbps for functional mrna
targets prediction [22]. specifically, pras has three major steps to perform the
functional targets prediction. first, pras merges the significant cross-linking sites
that are within a small interval of each other (20 nt is the default setting). if the
binding peaks are provided, pras will use them directly. second, pras assign a
reference site for the rbp score calculation. the reference site can be provided by

rbps’ functional targets prediction

we applied pras to predict the functional targets of rbps. four reference sites
were used: tss, tis, tts, and tes. we set

conclusions and discussions

in this study, through evaluating the performance of pras with different
reference sites, we demonstrated that tts, followed by tes and tis, plays
relatively more important roles for rna decay regulation of rbps. the
comparison in rbp regulation between k562 and hepg2 cells informed us that
the cell type-specific binding strength and functions are typical features for rbps.
these findings not only extended our knowledge in the regulation of rbps but
also made it possible to investigate either a single rbp or multiple rbps' binding
patterns. our study also threw light on the rbp regulatory networks in the future
by showing that the position-specific binding of rbps are closely related to their
functions.

 

the fact that many rbps bind to the 3'utr to play an important role in regulating
rna stability has been reported in a wide range of studies. for example, a kh
domain-containing are-binding protein (ksrp), is demonstrated to be an
essential factor for mrna decay via the 3'utr [30]. the underlying mechanisms
were disclosed as that the ability of ksrp to promote mrna decay correlates with
the ability of binding to the are [30]. another rbp named hur has been reported
to bind mainly to the 3'utr and to regulate the degradation of thousands of

target genes [31]. it was found that the kd of hur triggers the upregulation of.

the ability of binding to the are [30]. another rbp named hur has been reported
to bind mainly to the 3'utr and to regulate the degradation of thousands of
target genes [31]. it was found that the kd of hur triggers the upregulation of
mir-7 that is a microrna promoting mrna decay [31]. it is demonstrated in
another study that upf1 can sense the length of 3'utr and accelerate the decay
of mrnas with relatively longer 3'utrs [32]. it was also shown that the
translational readthrough around the translation termination site affects the
binding of upf1, which results in the inhibition of mrna decay [32]. our large-
scale analysis not only confirms the importance of 3'utr for rbps' binding and
regulation of mrna decay, but also provides a refined list of candidates for
further experimental validation.

the rbp binding and regulation differences between k562 and hepg2 suggest
the cell type-specific mechanisms of mrna stability regulation. admittedly, other
potential factors should also be taken into consideration. for instance, the rbps’
regulatory activity and their targets could be modulated through cell type-specific
gene expression [26]. the difference of gene expression level across cell types
can result in the variation of ip efficiency as well [26]. in addition, the rbp
knockdown efficiency may also differ, which makes the differential gene
expression analysis less comparable across cell lines. however, by connecting the
cell type-specific function with cell type-specific binding preferences, our analysis
provides a refined list of rbp candidates for further experimental validation to

were strongly enriched in coding sequence (cds) region (fig. 6a), the snd1-

that snd1-stabilized targets showed distinctly stronger enrichment on cds in
hepg2 compared to that in k562 (fig. 6a). however, the difference between the
two cell types was subtle for snd1-degraded targets (fig. 6b). these results of the
example rbp, snd1, suggest that the different regulation between hepg2 and
k562 by the same rbp is associated with the difference of the binding strength
between the two cell types.

cell type specific regulation is a typical characteristic of rbp

we then examined the difference in the rbps' regulation between two cell types,
k562 and hepg2. first, we found that the majority of the rbps (62%) have
different reference site usage in their rna decay regulation (supplementary fig.
$2). to study the rbp’s regulation difference in the target genes between two cell
types, we analyzed the overlap of the top 500 ranked targets between the two cell
types for each rbp. we found that the regulated group of genes are significantly
overlapping with each other between k562 and hepg? for all the 21 studied
rbps, with the adjusted fisher's exact test p-values plotted in fig. 5a. this result
indicates that the rbps tend to target the similar group of genes in different cell
types. however, by comparing the lfc of expression value in the kd condition
between the top 500 targets in k562 and those in hepg2, we found large
difference between the two cell types in the rna decay regulation by the rbps.
specifically, 13 out of the 21 studied rbps have shown significant difference in the
gene expression lfc between the top 500 ranked targets in k562 and those in
hepg2 (fig. 5b), which suggests that the stabilization and degradation function
can vary across cell types even though the rbps can target the similar group of
genes. for example, staphylococcal nuclease and tudor domain containing 1
(snd1) have significantly overlapping functional targets in the two cell types, with

genes. for example, staphylococcal nuclease and tudor domain containing 1
(snd1) have significantly overlapping functional targets in the two cell types, with
the fisher's exact test p-value equal to 4.9e-182 (fig. 5a). we found that 336 out
of the top 500 targets (67.2%) of snd1 in hepg2 obtained negative lfc value in
gene expression between the snd1 kd and wild-type condition, which sugggests
that the targets were stabilized by snd1 in the wild-type condition. however,
snd1 degraded most of its targets (309 out of the top 500, 61.8%) in k562, in
which the expression lfc is significantly different comparing to that in hepg2,
with the wilcoxon rank sum test p-value equal to 1.57e-29 (fig. 5c). another rbp,
protein quaking (qki) that is associated with rna stability [29], showed opposite
pattern to snd1 between the two cell types (fig. 5b), where the top 500 ranked
targets in hepg2 were significantly degraded comparing to those in k562, with
the wilcoxon rank sum test p-value equal to 0 (fig. 5d). the results of using the
top 200 ranked targets provided the similar pattern as those of top 500 targets
(supplementary fig. s3). these results suggest that the regulation of rbps being
studied follows a cell type specific pattern.

we sought to test whether the pattern of the reference site usage holds in the
roc analysis between rbp-stabilized vs. rbp-degraded targets selected based on
different rigorousness. specifically, we first set a sequence of cutoffs as the.
quantiles (10%, 30%, and 50%) of the distribution of the absolute value of the
expression lfcs. then, for each cutoff, we extracted a subset of genes whose
absolute expression lfc is larger or equal to the cutoff. third, for each subset of
potential rbp targets, we calculated the auc in the roc analysis of the pras
scores with all four reference sites. finally, we assigned the reference site with the
largest auc value to the corresponding rbp. we observed that the proportion of

 

ac tha rafaranca cita ic ralativaly cancictant [~6n0%) acrace diffarant

potential rbp targets, we calculated the auc in the roc analysis of the pras
scores with all four reference sites. finally, we assigned the reference site with the
largest auc value to the corresponding rbp. we observed that the proportion of
rbps with tts as the reference site is relatively consistent (~50%) across different
expression lfc cutoff (supplementary fig. s1). the results suggest that tts that is
selected by pras for most rna decay regulators is essential to the rbps' binding
to achieve their functions.

we then evaluated the strength of the rbps' regulation by examining the absolute
value of expression lfc in the rbp kd condition over wild-type of their top ranked
targets. we found that the top 500 targets of the “tts” group have significantly
higher absolute value of expression lfc than those of the “tss” group with the
kolmogorov-smirnov test (ks-test) p-value less than 2.2e-16 (fig. 4a).
surprisingly, we found that the “tes” group targets also have significantly higher
absolute value of expression lfc than those of the “tss” groups with the ks-test
p-value less than 2.2e-16. since tts and tes are the boundaries of the 3’ utr of
rna, these results indicate the essential association between the 3'utr of
transcripts and the regulation of their expression level by rbps. we then selected
four representative examples with the largest auc value from each reference site
group, respectively. by examining the difference in the absolute gene expression
lfc between the top 500 and bottom 500 ranked target genes by their
corresponding pras scores, we found that auh in the tts group obtained larger
difference between the top and bottom ranked genes (fig, 4d, ks test p-value

lec between the top 500 and bottom 500 ranked target genes by their
corresponding pras scores, we found that auh in the tts group obtained larger
difference between the top and bottom ranked genes (fig. 4d, ks test p-value
equal to 0), compared to ybx3 in the tss group (fig. 4b, ks test p-value equal to
2.9e-6), fmri in the tis group (fig. 4c, ks test p-value equal to 7.1e-4) and
pabpc4 in the tes group (fig. 4e , ks test p-value equal to 2.9e-8). the two
examples from the tts and tes groups again show larger difference between top
and bottom ranked targets than tss and tis groups, which confirms the
importance of the 3'utr for rbps' binding in rna decay regulation.

by applying the similar analysis to other known rna decay regulators, we found
pras-tts scores achieved significantly higher auc compared to pras-tss, pras-
tis, and pras-tes, with the wilcoxon signed-rank test's p-value equal to 7.5e-7,
3.8e-3, and 1.1e-3, respectively. however, the largest value of auc was not
always achieved by using tts as the reference site (fig. 2b), which suggests that
the rbps achieved their functions by using different reference sites. by assigning
the reference site with the largest auc value among the pras scores to each rbp,

we found nearly half af the rrps (44%) helongs to the class with tts as
‘sfivdis semeved by using pts as the reference site (rig. ss), which suggests that

the rbps achieved their functions by using different reference sites. by assigning
the reference site with the largest auc value among the pras scores to each rbp,
we found nearly half of the rbps (44%) belongs to the class with tts as the
reference site (fig. 3a). in addition, we examined the reference site usages for the
stabilization and degradation functions of rbps. following the procedure of
wagnon et al. [28], we further separated the rbps to two groups: rbps with
stronger change in expression for the stabilized targets than degraded targets are
regarded as “stabilization” group, and rbps with stronger change in expression
for the degraded targets than stabilized ones are regarded as the “degradation”
group. by comparing the reference site usage in these two groups, we found that
the “stabilization” group prefer tes and tts as the reference site, while the
“degradation” group prefer tts and tis (fig. 3b). on one hand, the common
usage of the tts indicates that this position is important to most human rbps in
the rna decay regulation. on the other hand, the difference between the
“stabilization” and “degradation” group of rbps in their choice of reference site
indicates the two directions of regulation is associated with different positions on
the transcript. to further investigate the binding around the reference sites for
the two regulation groups, we performed the meta-gene analysis on the eclip
data of the rbps. we calculated the eclip enrichment as
l-urn:x-wiley:20954689:qub2bf00193:equation:qub2bf00193-math-0001 as
suggested by van nostrand et al. [26], where

le-urn:x-wiley:20954689:qub2bf00193:equation:qub2bf00193-math-0003 is the
input read count from the eclip experiments [26]. in this way, a positive and a
negative peak intensity represents the enriched and the depleted eclip signal
compared to the input experiment, respectively. we found that both the
“stabilization” and “degradation” rbps have an enrichment of binding close to the
tts compared to the other reference sites (fig. 3c). however, the “degradation”
rbps achieve the strongest binding at the tts while the “stabilization” rbps’
binding peak is around 200nt downstream to the tts. even though rbps in the
“stabilization” group prefer tes as the reference site, the binding intensities
around tes is not comparable to those around tts. in addition, the binding
intensities of the “degradation” rbps around tis is much lower than those around
tts, regardless of the fact that tis is the second choice as the reference site for
“degradation” rbps. all these results suggest that the tts is essential for rbp’s
binding to regulate the rna fate.

binding to the translation termination site is important to
most human rbps in the rna decay regulation

we first aimed to study the role of the binding positions of rbps in achieving their
biological functions. recently, a computational method named pras was
developed for predicting functional targets of rbps, which integrates the
intensities and positions of the binding peaks of rbps in the prediction. pras
requires a reference site on a transcript as input, which is regarded as the most
important binding site for the rbp regulation and should be chosen from 4
candidates: transcription start site (tss), translation initiation site (tis), translation
termination site (tts), and transcription end site (tes). by comparing the
performance of the four reference sites in pras, we were able to evaluate the
importance of the reference sites for the rbp to achieve its function. the study
design, data structure and analysis procedures are summarized in fig. 1.
specifically, we analyzed the eclip data [25] in to human cell types, k562 and

specifically, we analyzed the eclip data [25] in two human cell types, k562 and
hepg2, from the encode consortium. following the similar procedure as in our
previous study [22], we applied pras to the rbps that are related to the rna
decay function [26]. to quantify the rbp's function in rna decay, we collected the
differential expression (de) analysis results by deseq [27] between the wild-type
and rbp knockdown (kd) conditions from encode for the corresponding rbps in
the two aforementioned cell types. we extracted the de genes (adjusted p-
value<= 0.05) and their log fold change (lfc) of the expression values in the rbp
kd condition over wild-type. the genes with positive or negative lfcs were
regarded as degraded and stabilized targets of the corresponding rbp,
respectively. we then applied pras to the eclip data of these target genes using
the 4 reference site candidates, respectively. after obtaining the pras scores, we
did the roc analysis between the rbp-stabilized and rbp-degraded genes for
each rbp. to set a comparison with other existing methods, we included the
performance of the two other methods mentioned in our previous study [22]:
peak per kilobase (ppk) in wang et al. [24], which calculated the score as the
number of significant clip peaks per kilobase; and the expressrna procedure of
rot et al. [23], which sums the number of reads in clip peaks within 200 nt
upstream and downstream flanking the polyadenylation sites. we noted the pras
with tss, tis, tts and tes as the reference site as pras-tss, pras-tis, pras-tts,
and pras-tes, ré

upstream and downstream flanking the polyadenylation sites. we noted the pras
with tss, tis, tts and tes as the reference site as pras-tss, pras-tis, pras-tts,
and pras-tes, respectively. for each rbp, we assessed the performance of the
methods by calculating the area under the curve (auc) of the roc curves. for
example, pras-tts obtained the highest auc (0.702) among the compared
methods in differentiating the stabilized and degraded targets of au rna binding
methylglutaconyl-coa hydratase (auh) (fig. 2a), a human rbp that is related to
the mrna decay via binding to the au-rich elements (ares). we found that the
performance of pras on the prediction of auh regulated targets varies a lot with
different reference sites (fig. 2a), among which pras-tss (auc= 0.552) and pras-
tis (auc= 0.57) have much worse performance than pras-tts. these results not
only indicate that pras can capture the functional targets with the appropriate
reference site but also suggest the translation termination site is important for
the function of auh in regulating rna decay.

 

 
 
developed for analyzing clip-seq data [11-20], which can be classified into two
major categories. the first class of computational tools are designed to detect
rbp binding peaks or differential binding between two conditions [12,15,16,21].
the second category of computational tools are developed to identify the rbps’
functional targets based on the binding peaks [22-24]. these computational tools
help elucidate not only the biological functions of rbps but also the underlying
mechanisms.

even though recent studies tried to dissect the functional roles of hundreds of
human rbps by associating their binding features with different functional
assays, few studies have systematically examined the relationship between the
position-dependent binding of rbps and their functions. the availability of a
large-scale collection of eclip data in the integrated encyclopedia of dna
elements in the human genome (encode) makes it possible to systematically
analyze the association between rbps' positional binding features and their
functional roles.

in this paper, we study the position-dependent functional bindings of rbps by
applying a new approach named protein-rna association strength (pras) [22] to
the eclip data of rna decay regulators in k562 and hepg2 cells. we demonstrate

that the translation termination site on the transcript is essential for rbp binding
to achieve their rna decay related functions. by comparing the rbp functional
targets in the two aforementioned cell types, we report the cell type-specific rbp
regulation. these analyses results shed light on the study of the mechanisms of
rbps' functions.
introduction

rna-binding proteins (rbps) play important roles in the post-transcriptional
regulation of rnas [1]. for example, rbp nova regulates alternative splicing and
poly(a) site usage [2]. it is essential to study these regulatory roles of rbps
because the abnormal expression of rbp-encoding genes is associated with
human diseases [3-6]. recently, cross-linking and immunoprecipitation followed
by sequencing (clip-seq) have been widely used to study rna-protein interaction
at high resolution [2,7-10].

regulation; (2) rbps' binding and regulation follow a cell-type specific pattern.

conclusions

these analysis results show the strong relationship between the binding
position and the functions of rbps, which provides novel insights into the
rbps' regulation mechanisms.
background

rna binding proteins (rbps) play essential roles in the regulation of rna
metabolism. recent studies have disclosed that rbps achieve their functions
via binding to their targets in a position-dependent pattern on rnas. however,
few studies have systematically addressed the associations between the rbp’s
functions and their positional binding preferences.

methods

here, we present large-scale analyses on the functional targets of human rbps
by integrating the enhanced cross-linking and immunoprecipitation followed
by sequencing (eclip-seq) datasets and the shrna knockdown followed by
rna-seq datasets that are deposited in the integrated encyclopedia of dna
elements in the human genome (encode) data portal.
