sers analyses of substrate-internalized microorganisms have
been limited to isolates from liquid samples [17,18]. solid
matrices generally inhibit the analysis of microorganisms in
situ because photon-based depth-profiling is generally only
possible within transparent substrates. however, raman
lasers can penetrate certain solid matrices for direct analyses
[19] but this level of imaging is only possible if noble metal
nanoparticles -used to enhance raman scattering- can
sufficiently interact with the intended analyte. solid matrices
therefore tend to prevent adequate nanoparticle-access to
bacteria if the cell is situated within the depth of the
substrate itself. aunps were recently identified as suitable
enhancers of raman signals within the depth of spinach
leaves and possess the ability to penetrate leaf tissues [20].
internalized bacteria populations were sers imaged within
plant stoma cavities to illustrate the application of this
approach during depth-profiling surveillance.

sers spectra were collected across symmetric quadrilateral
istributions on an xy-plane at various z-coordinates which
spanned the local position of guard cells. laser miliwattage
was incrementally increased respective to analytical depth
within the substrate. the data were converged to establish
two-dimensional maps which were representative of
bacterial demographics within the plant tissue at specific
depths. the two-dimensional maps (fig. 2) were collated via
z-stacking to display a three-dimensional atlas framework
which represented bacteria cells as they existed within the
internal matrix of the substrate. internalized bacteria could
be monitored in situ as deep as about 140m within the plant
tissue. mature spinach leaves generally range between
approximately 400-500um in overall thickness [21].
comprehensive analyses of bacteria which are internalized
throughout spinach leaves are therefore possible when

and ventral habitus of the sample. bacteria within larger

can be more matrix-specialized respective to internal tissues
(eg. palisade parenchyma or spongy mesophyll) and sers
depth signals proved to be strongest among the ventral
habitus of the leaf, due likely to the higher optical
transparency of the tissue that allows more laser penetration.
this experiment was the first attempt to probe internal
bacteria using sers and needs to be further validated in
future studies.

cantaloupe was employed as a second, more complex
substrate model to further evaluate the efficacy of the

to the screening of bacterial attachment following rinse-

can be surveilled in situ in a manner that is scaled to the size
of the cells and is nondestructive to their substrate.
3. results and discussion

e. coli 0157:h7 cells acted as a model bacterium to assess the
proposed chemical-based surveillance strategy. spinach
leaves were employed as a model substrate to investigate the
applicability of this approach to soft materials and biological
tissues which are low in photon reflectivity. sers confirmed
that 3-mercaptophenylboronic acid emits two major peaks at
the 998cm™ and 1070/1090cm™ positions (fig. 1). these
peaks are indicative of an in-plane benzene breathing mode
and c-s stretching [15]. in-plane visa c-h bond-bending
occurs when phenylboronic acids are esterified to bacteria
while being simultaneously excited by a raman laser line
{[14], [16]. a third peak was therefore evident at the
1024cm” position when 3-mercaptophenylboronic acid was
complexed between aunps and bacteria cells. the control
spectra of aunps, aunps interacted with 3-mpba, and aunps
with bacteria were reported previously [7,8].

2. experimental
1. introduction

bacterial analyses were founded upon microscopy but have
evolved to higher ex situ technologies. in situ observations are
necessary when studying the behavior of bacteria directly
among natural ecosystems, however, in situ surveillance
strategies remain limited to electron micrographs and
fluorescent bacteria cells. electron micrographs of bacteria
provide ultra-high-definition visual insight below the
nanoscale but the analysis is statuesque in nature and
involves protracted sample preparations [1]. cellular
fluorescence enables the real-time analysis of bacteria but
most species do not fluoresce without an artificial stain or
specialized protein expression [2]. photobleaching can also
occur when a fluorophore permanently loses its ability to
fluoresce due to a photon-induced chemical damage. in
addition, the scale of fluorescent microscopy is generally
limited to the microscopic field-of-view on the sample

addition, the scale of fluorescent microscopy is generally
limited to the microscopic field-of-view on the sample
surfaces, neither technology is effective at imaging bacteria
inside of plant tissues without damaging the tissue.

 

recent technological and instrumental advancements in
raman imaging have allowed us to overcome these important
restraints toward the surveillance of bacterial communities in
nature. the improvement which has been made to the raman.
system now allows for sweeping surveillance of condensed

span a broader centimeter-scale. the system is no longer

of an analyte in real-time directly in situ. however, traditional
raman techniques use high laser power for bacterial imaging
due to its low sensitivity. it is therefore incompatible for
imaging on fragile leaf tissue samples. the second
technological improvement is from surface-enhanced raman
scattering (sers) [3], which uses certain metallic nano-
substrates. suchas gald nanenartiges(aunps) fo.enhance
technological improvement is from surface-enhanced raman
scattering (sers) [3], which uses certain metallic nano-
substrates such as gold nanoparticles (aunps) to enhance
analyte signals under low laser powers and is able to
suppress fluorescence, which minimizes damage to and
interference from leaf tissues. however, two challenges still
remain when imaging bacteria on and in plant tissues. first,
the sers signal of bacteria varies greatly depending on the
bacteria and the environment. the label-free identification of
bacteria, based on the sers signals of bacteria alone, is
therefore not robust. second, the unmodified aunps do not
have any degree of specificity for bacterial cells and are
therefore inefficient as a bacteria detection probe within leaf
tissues.

to overcome these two challenges, we and others have
utilized boronic acids as sers indicators of bacterial presence
within a sample {[4], [5], [6]. [7], [8], [9] [10]]. phenylboronic

acids possess diol-groups which can form stable complexes
with vicinal diols via esterification. bacteria cells possess a
variety of polyols along the outer-membrane surface which
enables their envelopment in phenylboronic acids [11]. thiols
and aunps form a strong au-s bond [[12], [13], [14].
mercaptophenylboronic acids can therefore bridge together
aunps and bacteria cells to construct functionalized
enhancers of raman photon scattering. based on these
previous studies, we hypothesized that bacterial populations
could be surveilled en masse based on sers scattering of
mercaptophenylboronic acid/aunps interactions directly
among soft materials which exhibit low reflectivity. to prove
this hypothesis, we applied 3-mercaptophenylboronic acid
(3-mpba) labeled escherichia coli 0157:h7 as the model
bacterium to evaluate the capability of sers mapping to
image surface and internal bacteria on and in spinach leaves,
as well as on complex plant tissue surfaces such as
cantaloupe rinds and peanut shells. in addition, the behavior

a chemical imaging method to mass surveil bacteria cells

abstract

a chemical imaging method to mass surveil bacteria cells
among plant tissues in situ is reported. bacteria cells were
pre-labeled with 3-mercaptophenylboronic acid for
complexation with gold nanoparticles. surface-enhanced
raman spectra were collated en masse to generate panoramic
chemical images of bacteria populations. the approach was
successfully employed to study the distribution of mass
bacteria populations directly on and in selected plant tissues.
this study demonstrates the great potential with which sers
imaging can be utilized for the study of bacterial cells among
complex matrices, in some ways that are superior to electron
and fluorescent microscopies.
highlights

leaves.
