professor ames is probably best known within the field of
carcinogenesis and among regulatory authorities for
developing the “ames test” [1,2], a simple in vitro test
designed to identify, and partially characterize, chemicals
that can cause gene mutations. the ames test is an integral
component of mutagenicity and carcinogenicity screening
protocols for regulated products and environmental
chemicals, as well as a widely used research tool. ames’

insight and innovation have contributed to major advances in
nutritional science, general toxicology, safety assessment, and
biochemistry. his many contributions include the
establishment of a comprehensive database of quantitative
analyses of cancer bioassay results, assessment of the relative
risks to human health from exposures to natural and

nutritional impacts on human health. dr. ames has stayed the
course in communicating the importance of antioxidants in
countering the mutagenic effects of metabolism, and he
considers his most recent work linking adequate
consumption of 30 known vitamins and minerals with
successful aging to be his most important contribution [3].

with the passage of time, it is not uncommon for the
accomplishments of a well-known scientist to undergo a

“presentism” wherein seminal advances made by earlier
investigators are inadvertently subsumed into common
knowledge. but having followed ames’ work since the mi
1970s, we are cognizant that the eponymous ames test is but
a single chapter in a long and rich narrative.

 

in the early 1960s, ames initiated a series of classic studies on
the histidine operon of salmonella typhimurium [(6], [7], [8],
[9], [10], [11], [12]] for which he was elected to the national
academy of sciences in 1972, but a full description of this
foundational period of molecular physiology is beyond the
current scope. initially, the ames salmonella strains identified
direct mutagens not requiring metabolic activation such as n-
methyl-n'-nitro-n-nitrosoguanidine (mnng) or methyl
methanesulfonate (mms). soon thereafter, liver microsomes
or s9 fractions were added to facilitate identification of
promutagens that require metabolic conversion to dna-
reactive forms, such as dimethylnitrosamine (dmn) {[13],
[14], [15], [16]. while employing $9 allowed differentiation

reactive forms, such as dimethylnitrosamine (dmn) [[ 13].
[14], [15], [16]]. while employing s9 allowed differentiation
between direct mutagens and promutagens, its major impact
was the new ability to often discriminate between genotoxic
mutagens/carcinogens and non-genotoxic carcinogens [17].

 

 

when a chemi

  

is mutagenic, the carcinogenicity observed
in the assay can be relevant to humans. chemicals are
designated as carcinogens based on long term animal test
results. these results are often diverse, both in terms of
potencies and the mechanism of action, which leads to
complexity in their assessment for cancer risk to humans.
carcinogens are currently categorized into two classes,
genotoxic and non-genotoxic carcinogens on which cancer
risk assessment can be reasonably based. genotoxic
carcinogens are chemicals that exert carcinogenicity via the
induction of mutations. owing to their dna interaction
properties, there is thought to be no safe exposure threshold
or dose [18]. ames and gold [19] said

"in rodent cancer tests mutagens, in contrast to non-mutagens,
are more likely to be carcinogenic, more likely to be positive in
or dose [18]. ames and gold [19] said”

"in rodent cancer tests mutagens, in contrast to non-mutagens,
are more likely to be carcinogenic, more likely to be positive in
both rats and mice, more likely toxic at low doses, and more
likely to cause tumors at multiple sites".

  

genotoxic carcinogens are regulated under the assumption
that they pose a cancer risk for humans, even at very low
doses. in contrast, non-genotoxic carcinogens, which induce
cancer through mechanisms other than mutations, such as
hormonal effects, cytotoxicity, cell proliferation, or epigenetic
changes, are thought to have a safe exposure threshold or
dose; thus, their use in society is permitted unless the
exposure or intake level would exceed the threshold. [20,21]

it should be realized that clear-cut criteria for this
classification have not been established because of

in the available information concerning
mechanisms of action of non-genotoxic carcinogens. future
scientific advances leading to elucidation of the subcellular
mechanisms of carcinogenesis are necessary for

scientific advances leading to elucidation of the subcellular
mechanisms of carcinogenesis are necessary for
establishment of the unified, more realistic, and mechanism-
based approach to cancer risk estimation from exposure to
chemicals [21].

this article provides a summary of the significant, and
seminal contributions made by ames and his colleagues to
the historical progression of the understanding of chemical
carcinogenesis and mutagenesis, the effects of nutritional
status on human health, and a brief discussion of biochemical
alterations caused by exposure to natural and synthetic
chemicals is given. any brief summary of a topic as expansive
and complex as the unraveling of the mechanisms underlying
chemical carcinogenesis and other aspects of human disease
will only touch upon some of the major conceptual advances
to which ames and his colleagues contributed. we hope that
scientists of all ages familiar only with the test that bears his
name will further investigate the historical progression of the
conceptualization of cancer and the relationship of nutrition
to human health and disease. in particular, as the field of

conceptualization of cancer and the relationship of nutrition

chemical carcinogenesis gradually moves away from primary
reliance on animal testing to alternative protocols under the
rubric of new approach methodologies (nams) (i.e., any non-
animal-based approach that can be used to provide
information in the context of chemical hazard and risk
assessment) [22], the understanding of the carcinogenic
process and nutritional influences on this and other diseases
of aging that have been advanced by dr. ames’ contributions
will lead to longer and more healthy lives in the future.

     

the field of chemical carcinogenesis research informally
dates from a series of observations of unusual tumors found
in association with certain occupations [23], including
chimney sweeps [24,25], cotton mule spinners [24,26,27],
aniline dye workers [28], clock workers using radium-
impregnated dye [29], and chemical workers exposed to
benzene [30]. following the association of these cancers in

benzene [30]. following the association of these cancers in
humans with exposure to the probable causative agents,
these and other agents were later confirmed to be
carcinogenic in animals {[31], [32], [33]. [34], [35]. [36]. by
the 1950s, rodents were in wide use in comparatively short-
term studies wherein exposures much higher than those
expected in exposed humans were employed [37].

the concept of the ldso (dose at which 50 % of the test
animals died) was established during this decade [37].
president richard nixon's “war on cancer”, enacted in 1971,
provided funding to the national cancer institute (nci) that
led to extensive carcinogenicity testing of chemicals in mice
and rats of both sexes usually administered at doses
comparable to today’s maximum tolerated dose (mtd) [37].
this bioassay program was transferred to the national
institute of environmental health sciences (niehs) in 1979
and included as a component of the national toxicology
program (ntp).

today, the mutational basis for cancer is well understood but
that was not the case 60 years ago. the idea of chromosomal
damage as a carcinogenic event dates back to at least boveri
in 1914 [38] but it is little remembered that in the 1960s a
leading contender for the origin of cancer was a chemically
damaged protein [[39], [40], [41], [42]]. the stimulus for the
war on cancer was the discovery that retroviruses could
cause cancer [43], suggesting that the cancer problem would
be solved within the decade [44,45].

against this backdrop, bruce ames devised a simple assay for
the mutagenicity of chemicals - the famous ames test - and
found that most known carcinogens were mutagens in the
test [5,46]. these results synergized with contemporaneous
epidemiologic studies showing that most cancers had
environmental causes [47], established by showing the risk of
cancer development can be modified by geographic
migration [[48], [49], (50]]. the result was the new concept of
environmental mutagenesis - a solvable problem. in the lay
press, this concept was simplified to cigarettes and

migration [[48], [49], (50]]. the result was the new concept of
environmental mutagenesis - a solvable problem. in the lay
press, this concept was simplified to cigarettes and
smokestacks, but it in fact included smoked and cooked
foods, sunlight, natural pesticides in plants, and personal
behaviors [5]. the concept of dna as a target for carcinogenic
mutations remains key today [51,52], and many of the
mutated genes have been identified [53,54]. while most
carcinogens were observed to be positive in the ames test,
zeiger noted that in cases where two in vitro mammalian cell
tests covering both mutation, clastogenicity, and aneugenicity
endpoints were negative despite the chemical’s positivity in
the ames test, the chemical should be considered as lacking
carcinogenic potential [51]. mutations were thus important,
but perhaps not the complete explanation of cancer [55,56].

in 1976, sontag et al. [53] at the nci published “guidelines for
carcinogen bioassay in small rodents.” this publication
defined the mtd as “...the highest dose of the test agent

defined the mtd as “...the highest dose of the test agent
during the chronic study that can be predicted not to alter
the animals’ longevity from effects other than
carcinogenicity” [5g]. under current guidelines, the primary
consideration for the selection of the mtd is a
histopathological appearance (typically based on 90-day
preliminary studies) with adverse effects on weight gain
assuming a secondary role [56].

the assumption underlying the selection of the mtd in
animal bioassays is that adverse effects at very high doses are
qualitatively the same as those occurring at low doses.
unfortunately, this assumption has proven to be incorrect in
many, if not most, circumstances. in the 1980s, cohen,
ellwein, and colleagues conducted a series of studies that
demonstrated that cellular proliferation could amplify the
number of mutations thereby increasing tumor formation in
experimental animals [57,58,18,59], and later it was found
that cellular toxicity in mammalian cells at high doses also
causes chromosomal damage that does not occur at lower
nontoxic doses [60].

the studies of moolgavkar and knudson, accounting for the
epidemiology of breast and lung cancer by applying
mathematics to biological models, also played an important
role during this era [61]. throughout the 1990s, ames and
gold incorporated these new findings into their thinking
resulting in a series of publications that brought to light the
major shortcoming in testing for carcinogenicity at the mtd.
the most important of these publications was a paper by
ames and gold [62] in science. in that paper they stated:

“a clarification of the mechanism of carcinogenesis is developing
at a rapid rate. this new understanding undermines many
assumptions of current regulatory policy toward rodent
carcinogens and necessitates rethinking the utility and meaning
of routine animal cancer tests. at a recent watershed meeting on
carcinogenesis, much evidence was presented suggesting that
mitogenesis plays a dominant role in carcinogenesis. our own
rethinking of mechanism was prompted by our findings that:
spontaneous dna damage caused by endogenous oxidants is
mitogenesis plays a dominant role in carcinogenesis. our own
rethinking of mechanism was prompted by our findings that:
spontaneous dna damage caused by endogenous oxidants is
remarkably frequent and in chronic testing at the maximum
tolerated dose (mtd), more than half of all chemicals tested
(both natural and synthetic) are carcinogens in rodents, and a
high percentage of these carcinogens are not mutagens [62].

ina related paper by ames and gold [19] in pnas entitled
“chemical carcinogenesis: too many rodent carcinogens”
they stated:

“the administration of chemicals at the maximum tolerated dose
(mtd) in standard animal cancer tests is postulated to increase
cell division (mitogenesis), which in turn increases rates of
mutagenesis and thus carcinogenesis. the animal data are
consistent with this mechanism, because a high proportion-
about half-of all chemicals tested (whether natural or synthetic)
are indeed rodent carcinogens. we conclude that at the low
doses of most human exposures, where cell killing does not
occur, the hazards to humans of rodent carcinogens may be
much lower than is commonly assumed” [19].

doses of most human exposures, where cell killing does not
occur, the hazards to humans of rodent carcinogens may be
much lower than is commonly assumed” [19].

these seminal papers clearly implicate the existence of a
non-mutagenic role in cancer development secondary to
enhanced reparative cell proliferation stimulating the clonal
expansion of imperfectly repaired spontaneous errors in dna
replication.

during the decade of the 1990s, lois gold, bruce ames, and
tom sloane built the carcinogenic potency database (cpdb)
[63], which eventually compiled and summarized the results
from 6540 curated long-term animal cancer tests conducted
on 1547 chemicals [64]. these 6540 tests included both
positive and negative results published over 50 years in the
peer-reviewed scientific literature up through 2001 [64]. the
cpdb also included studies conducted by the national
toxicology program (ntp) up through 2004. ames and his
colleagues qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed this huge
data set, largely with doses at or near the mtd, with their
interpretative analyses resulting in over 100 scientific
colleagues qualitatively and quantitatively analyzed this huge
data set, largely with doses at or near the mtd, with their
interpretative analyses resulting in over 100 scientific
publications [64]. the cpdb is still growing. gold et al. stated:
“the carcinogenic potency database (cpdb) is a systematic and
unifying analysis of the published results of the diverse literature
of chronic, long-term animal cancer tests on individual
chemicals. a detailed set of inclusion rules is designed to restrict
the database to reasonably thorough experiments for evaluating
carcinogenic activity and carcinogenic potency. the cpdb
standardizes the experimental results and creates an easily
accessible resource that has been widely used to address a
variety of research and regulatory issues in carcinogenesis” [65].

 

surprisingly, over 50 % of all the chemicals tested, whether
synthetic or naturally occurring, induced tumors in rodents
[19,65]. ames and gold noted that

“most” (of the chemicals) “were selected because they were
widely used industrially, e.g., they were high-volume chemicals,
pesticides, food additives, dyes or drugs" [19].

this extensive hady of work provided strong sunnort for the
widely used industrially, e.g., they were high-volume chemicals,
pesticides, food additives, dyes or drugs" [19].

this extensive body of work provided strong support for the
idea that dosing at or near the mtd was leading to a high
false positive rate in rodent cancer bioassays, because the
high dose induced mitogenesis, which in turn increased
mutagenesis [66,67]. recognition of this fact eventually
resulted in the inclusion of a wider range at middle and lower
doses in most carcinogenicity studies. many scientists have
questioned the clinical relevance in humans of high dose
effects observed in long-term rodent bioassays. one such
publication by goodman [68], concluded that,

“it is time to say goodbye to the standard two-year rodent
bioassay. while a few, primarily genotoxic, compounds which
are clearly associated with human cancer test positive in the
bioassay, there is no science-based, sound foundation for
presuming it provides either a valid broad (across different
chemicals) capability for discerning potential human
carcinogens or a valid starting point for making human risk
assessment decisions.”

in addition to playing an important role in the development
of in vitro genotoxicity assays and elucidating the role of
mitogenesis in inducing mutagenesis, ames and his
colleagues made a significant contribution to the formation
of key concepts about the role of exposure with respect to the
carcinogenicity of environmental chemicals. ames and
colleagues’ quantitative analysis of the results compiled in
their database of chronic rodent studies provided important
context on relative risks of cancer and other toxicities,
demonstrating the fallacy of the popular belief that synthetic
chemicals were generally more toxic and carcinogenic than
naturally occurring chemicals [69]. in ames et al. [69], the
unexpected finding that 99.99 % (by weight) of the pesticides
ingested in the american diet are chemicals produced by
plants to prevent being eaten by insects or higher animals
attracted wide attention. also, in 1990, duke at the u.
department of agriculture, agriculture research service
(ars) in oxford, mississippi [70] provided strong support for
attracted wide attention. also, in 1990, duke at the u.s.
department of agriculture, agriculture research service
(ars) in oxford, mississippi [70] provided strong support for
this contention made by ames, profet, and gold [69]. duke
[70] reported that tens of thousands of chemicals have been
identified in plants with most functioning as pesticides, and
that experts estimated the existence of hundreds of,
thousands of natural plant products [71]. the realization that
humans were ingesting about 1.5 g per day of a huge variety
of natural plant pesticides [69] raised the question as to
whether these chemicals were toxic in standard toxicology
tests. this 1990 paper reported that 52 natural plant
pesticides had been tested in chronic rodent bioassays with
27/52 (52 %) displaying carcinogenicity. this carcinogenic
percentage is comparable to that seen for synthetic chemicals

we eat contains carcinogens, mutagens, clastogens, and/or
teratogens when classified as such by testing up to the
maximum tolerated dose. this brings into focus the fact that
many scientists have lost sight of the first principle of
toxicology, as first noted by paracelsus in his key concept that
“the dose makes the poison”. it is paramount that biologically
or clinically relevant exposures must be considered as a
precondition for making relevant evaluations of risk. natural
and synthetic chemicals have similar proportions of positive
outcomes in high-dose hazard identification protocols.
however, human exposure to natural chemicals is much
greater than that from environmental contaminants and
chemical residues. thus, in many cases, the overall risk from
exposure to naturally occurring chemicals is higher than that,
from environmental contaminants and chemical residues.

in 2018, the national institutes of health estimated that
1,735,350 new cancer cases were diagnosed in the united
states and 609,640 patients died from various forms of
cancer [73]. the vast majority of those cancer deaths in both
men and women occurred from cancers derived from

men and women occurred from cancers derived from
epithelial cells, that is, carcinomas [73]. the most lethal
cancers in american women based upon estimated deaths
occurred in the lung and bronchus (70,500), breast (40,920),
colon and rectum (23,240), pancreas (21,310), and ovary
(14,070) [73 63]. the largest cancer killers in men (based
upon estimated deaths) occurred in the lung and bronchus

pancreas (23,020), and liver (20,540) [73].

expanded, and progressed in association with particular
changes in genes and also epigenetic alterations [74].
currently employed genotoxicity testing protocols emphasize
testing for the initiating (mutational) potential of the test

cytotoxicity leading to increased cellular proliferation rates
and high false-positive rates of tumor induction from non-
genotoxic chemicals [[75], [76], [77]]. the low cancer rate of
induction from high radiation exposures experienced by
atomic bomb survivors in hiroshima and nagasaki, japan [78]
and the epidemiological evidence showing that cigarette
smoking duration more than intensity [79] is associated with
high lung cancer risk both support the important role of
cellular proliferation in the clinical presentation of human
carcinomas. tumor promotion has a technical definition as an
agent or treatment that enhances tumor production when,
given chronically after an initiator, but not alone or when
given prior to the initiator [80], [81], [82]]. cancer hazard
assessment testing protocols and weight-of-the-evidence
analysis of agent-specific cancer risk should be better aligned
with the pathogenesis of human carcinoma [74,83]. advances

cancer might increase attention on screening assays for

cancer might increase attention on screening assays for
tumor-promoting potential [84]. proliferative effects are very
important and must be considered in evaluating
carcinogenesis risk. this could be done without requiring
new screening assays for tumor promotors. ames was
focused mainly on cancers driven by mutagenesis (both
spontaneous and exogenously driven).

 

 

thomas kuhn popularized the idea that scientific revolutions
occur via paradigm shifts [85,86]. in the 1980s and 1990s, the
work of cohen, moolgavkar, ames, and their colleagues had a
major impact on the paradigm shift to more science-based
hazard and risk assessment of the cancer risks presented by
chemical exposure. over the last 20 years, others have
challenged the idea that the mutagenicity of chemicals
provides a full explanation of carcinogenic potential, and that
the current rodent bioassay adequately predicts risks of
humans developing cancers [87]. as we move forward into
the era of namss, these paradigm shifts will continue to move
the field toward more relevant cancer assessments.

the era of namss, these paradigm shifts will continue to move
the field toward more relevant cancer assessments.

ames’ work in nutrition and aging may also herald a
paradigm shift. his “triage theory” suggests that when
vitamin and mineral intake is limited, metabolism is shunted
toward pathways favoring short-term survival at the expense
of pathways impacting long-term health maintenance [88]
(www.bruceames.org/triage.pdfa. if correct, this could have a
significant positive public health impact as vitamin and
mineral supplementation are inexpensive and could not only
ameliorate the incidence and prevalence of degenerative
iseases but also reduce healthcare costs [3].

 

 

ames has also shown that aging is associated with adverse
modifications of thymidine synthesis that can cause genetic
damage. one example is the dramatic effect of low folic acid
or vitamin bg levels on chromosomal damage in normal
humans [89]. even levels within the low end of what is
considered the normal range have dramatic effects leading to

considered the normal range have dramatic effects leading to
uracil misincorporation into dna and subsequent breakage
and/or missegregation of chromosomes [90]. another
important example is his laboratory's demonstration of the
high levels of oxidative dna, protein, and lipid damage that
result from reactive species necessary for normal metabolism
[91,92]. this damage accumulates with aging and can cause
mitochondrial decay and increase the risk of cancer
development.

across multiple disciplines over six decades, bruce ames has
contributed enormously to our understanding of the
mechanisms of chronic disease development and its
prevention. the paradigm shifts in which he has played a
central role - the ames test for mutagens, the ubiquity of
natural pesticides and other mutagenic and teratogenic
chemicals occurring in nature, mitogenesis induction of
mutagenesis near the maximum tolerated dose, the ‘triage
theory’ of nutrition - have had a profound impact on the
work of many scientists.

his research and public stances on science, risk, and health
have educated generations of students and provided data for
risk assessments on the safety evaluations of commercial
products by regulators. this research has also positively
influenced policymakers at the federal, state, and
international levels. those of us privileged to have spent time
with dr. ames and his wonderful wife and colleague,
professor giovanna ferro-luzzi ames, have been further
gifted by their kindness, wisdom, and humor.

dr. bruce ames turned 92 on december 16, 2020. he
considers his most recent work linking adequate
consumption of 30 known vitamins and minerals with
successful aging to be his most important contribution. with
the passage of time, it is not uncommon for the
accomplishments of a well-known scientist to undergo a
parsimonious reductionism in the public mind - pasteut’s
vaccine, mendel's peas, pavlov's dogs, ames’ test. those of us
in the research generation subsequent to dr. ames’ are
undoubtedly affected by our own unconscious tendencies
toward accepting the outstanding achievements of the past as
commonplace. in doing so, seminal advances made by earlier
investigators are often inadvertently subsumed into common
knowledge. but having followed ames’ work since the mid-
1970s, we are cognizant that the eponymous ames test is but
a single chapter in a long and rich narrative. that narrative

1970s, we are cognizant that the eponymous ames test is but
a single chapter in a long and rich narrative. that narrative
begins with ames’ classic studies on the histidine operon of
salmonella, for which he was elected to the national academy
of sciences.

of chemical carcinogenesis to which ames and his colleagues
contributed is provided. any summary of a topic as expansive

familiar with ames only through the eponymous ames test
will further investigate the historical progression of the
conceptualization of cancer caused by chemical exposure. as
the field of chemical carcinogenesis gradually moves away
from primary reliance on animal testing to alternative
protocols under the rubric of new approach methodologies
(nam) an understanding of where we have been might help
to guide where we should go.
