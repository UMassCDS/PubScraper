nmr and ms are both almost label-free approaches that can measure
membrane interactions in their natural forms. however, direct in situ analysis
in live cell membranes is still difficult for both methods. the recent
development of sims seems to provide a promising solution for this issue.
furthermore, it is challenging to apply nmr and ms to study really fast (< ms)
membrane interactions or conformational changes. indeed, efforts have
been taken to improve the temporal resolution of ms, for example, by
conjugating with a flow quenching system (rist et al., 2005; giladi and
khananshvili, 2020).

nmr provides great spatial resolution for structural studies. in comparison,
ms and other methods usually suffer from low spatial resolutions. to
potentially improve their resolution, complementing the experimental data
with computational simulations can be an effective approach to obtain
molecular-level structural information (martens et al., 2019).

fluorescence-based methods allow direct and real-time visualization of
transient interactions in live cell membranes. using commercially available
microscopes, currently it is easy to precisely measure ms-s range
membrane interactions. meanwhile, advanced imaging systems have been
designed and applied for detecting even faster (< ps) interactions (simmons
and konermann, 2002; rist et al., 2005; honigmann et al., 2014; sezgin et
al, 2019). we are expecting these advanced systems to be more readily
available to the broad community of researchers in the future.

with the development of versatile fluorescent membrane probes, advanced
fluorescence microscopes have genuinely reshaped our perception of
membrane transient interactions. however, methods that allow high-
throughput and quantitative analysis are still imited, especially for screening
compounds that can potentially regulate critical transient interactions in
diseases. as a result, membrane heterogeneities and cell-to-cell variations of
these dynamic interactions or so-called membrane “interactome” are largely
unknown.

even using the same method, contradictory results have been obtained for
many transient interactions such as in the case of membrane nanodomains.
this inconsistency may result from the limited precision of the methods, but
also is likely due to the dynamic nature of these transient interactions. under
different cellular environment and conditions, the lifetime of membrane
interactions can be varied dramatically. standard experimental procedure

different cellular environment and conditions, the lifetime of membrane
interactions can be varied dramatically. standard experimental procedure
and statistical data analysis should be established. meanwhile, it will be
helpful to use more than one method to validate the observed results for
membrane transient interactions.

a systematic comparison of the accuracy and performance of available
methods in analyzing membrane transient interactions is highly desired,
most laboratories chose the methods based on their own experience and
expertise. one goal of this review is to provide the first step in initiating such
comparison. we believe once a well-accepted membrane model and
standard approach were established, versatile functions of transient
interactions in regulating membrane trafficking and cell signaling can be
discovered in both healthy and diseased cell conditions.

this review has been focusing on major methods in studying transient
membrane interactions among individual lipids and proteins. other
interesting membrane interactions, such as membrane vesicle formation,
transportation, and fusion, are also critical for various cellular functions such
as cell growth, hormone secretion, and neurotransmission (novick and
schekman, 1979; wickner and schekman, 2008; rupert et al., 2017; welsh
et al, 2017). unfortunately, because of the limited space in this article, we
are not able to cover all these topics. we would like to refer interested
audience to those reports mentioned above.

audience to those reports mentioned above.

in short, the introduction of new methodologies has been continuously
improving our knowledge of transient membrane interactions. it is important
that researchers with different expertise to collaboratively work together in
developing more powerful toolkits. we believe that future evolution of
methods and instrumentations will continue to play a major role in
advancing our understanding of the dynamic nature of cells and other
biological system.

dna-based membrane probes

we have recently developed a dna-based approach to image transient
interactions in live cell membranes (you et al., 2017). in this approach,
individual membrane lipid-lipid and protein-protein interactions are
converted into changes in the collective fluorescence signal, which can be
easily detected by fluorescence microscopes. dna probes can be covalently
modified onto target membrane lipids without affecting their lateral diffusion
and domain partition (you et al., 2017; bagheri et al., 2019a). the highly
precise and controllable dna hybridizations have further allowed
programmable manipulation and function of these membrane-anchored
dna probes (baaheri et al. 2019b: zhao et al. 2020)

and domain partition (you et al., 2017; bagheri et al., 2019a). the highly
precise and controllable dna hybridizations have further allowed
programmable manipulation and function of these membrane-anchored
dna probes (bagheri et al., 2019b; zhao et al., 2020).

our dna probe is realized through a toehold-mediated strand displacement
reaction (figure 5c). to measure membrane transient lipid-lipid interactions,
two target lipids were modified with a quencher strand (s,) and an
unmodified anchor strand (sz), respectively. once two lipids are located
within ~5 nm, a fluorophore-labeled dna probe (w) will translocate from s2
to s1, resulting in a fluorescence quenching. by monitoring membrane
fluorescence signal changes, this approach allows live-cell imaging of s-to-
ms-range lipid-lipid interactions using common fluorescence microscope
and flow cytometer. similar strategy can also be applied to monitor
membrane protein-protein interactions using target protein-specific dna
aptamers (you et al., 2017).

this modular dna-based approach can be easily adopted to different targets
on the cell membrane. however, it is necessary to carefully evaluate the
effect of dna modification on the membrane properties and behaviors of
the target molecules. furthermore, the membrane densities of the dna
probes should be kept in the minimum possible level to provide enough
fluorescence signals but also avoid membrane interruptions.
photoactivatable lipid probes

photoactivatable lipid probes

a powerful method to profile proteome-wide membrane lipid-protein
interactions is based on photoactivatable lipid probes (xia and peng, 2013;
peng et al., 2014). in this method, after incorporating into the membranes
and upon light irradiation, photoactivatable lipids can be activated and cross-
linked with their interacting membrane protein partners (figure 5b)
transiently formed membrane lipid-protein complexes can thus be
covalently stabilized. after separation and purification, different approaches
such as ms, autoradiography, high-performance liquid chromatography, and
gel electrophoresis can be used to analyze the cross-linked membrane
complexes.

these photoactivatable lipid probes can be used in both artificial and live cell
membranes. they have been used to proteome-wide map and identify new
membrane proteins that can transiently bind target lipids (niphakis et al.,
2015). without prior knowledge, unlabeled endogenous membrane proteins
can be directly cross-linked with the photoactivatable lipid probes once an
interaction happens. meanwhile, with the help of bifunctional lipid probes,
the binding sites of these lipid-protein complexes can also be determined
(xia and peng, 2013; peng et al. 2014). in addition to membrane lipid-
protein interactions, these photoactivatable probes can also be used to map
dynamic lipid-anchored protein-protein interactions.

on the other hand, by introducing several functional groups in the lipid
protein interactions, these photoactivatable probes can also be used to map.
dynamic lipid-anchored protein-protein interactions.

on the other hand, by introducing several functional groups in the lipid
molecules, the natural interaction pattern of the target lipid may be
disrupted. in addition, the crosslinking efficiency is highly dependent on the
activity and position of the functional group. as a result, the choice of bio-
orthogonal crosslinking moiety and tagging site in lipids is critical in
developing accurate and efficient photoactivatable probes. a series of
photoactivatable lipid probes have been developed (xia and peng, 2013).
with continuous efforts in the characterization and optimization of these
functional probes, the photo-crosslinking approach can play a critical role in
profiling membrane transient interactions.
one major advantage of membrane two-hybrid assay is that it can be used
for high-throughput screening. for example, using this approach, crkii has

one major advantage of membrane two-hybrid assay is that it can be used
for high-throughput screening. for example, using this approach, crkii has
been identified as a new adaptor protein that can dynamically interact with
membrane epidermal growth factor receptor in oncogenic signaling
(petschnigg et al., 2014). these membrane two-hybrid assays can also
potentially be useful in discovering drug molecules that can interfere with
transient protein interactions during membrane signaling.

on the other hand, compared with the reversible fret interactions, these
membrane two-hybrid assays are normally irreversible and not suitable to
image the location or dynamics of membrane interactions. the relatively
high rate of false-positive signals, e.g., from protein overexpression, requires
careful data analysis and validation. in theory, other methods that can
convert dynamic interactions into permanent signals, such as in situ
proximity ligation assay (petschnigg et al., 2014) and bimolecular
fluorescence complementation (kodama and hu, 2012), may also be useful
for characterizing membrane transient interactions. however, the interaction
time required for the proximity-based ligation or reconstitution of
fluorescent proteins made these methods practically challenging to study
short-lived membrane interaction events.

membrane two-hybrid assays

yeast and mammalian two-hybrid assays have been developed to
characterize membrane protein-protein interactions, including transient
ones (snider et al., 2010; petschnigg et al., 2014). in these assays, each half
of a split ubiquitin is tagged, respectively, to the target membrane protein
(named as bait and prey). once bait and prey proteins interact, a
pseudoubiquitin is formed and then cleaved by cytosolic deubiquitinating
enzymes to release a reporter protein, such as a transcription factor for
generating fluorescent proteins or luciferases (petschnigg et al., 2014; figure
5a).

forster resonance energy transfer

férster resonance energy transfer (fret) is another powerful technique to
investigate membrane molecular interactions (rao and mayor, 2005; loura
et al,, 2010; loura and prieto, 2011). by modifying the target membrane
partner with a donor and acceptor fluorophore, respectively, once two

molecules are in close proximity (<10 nm), the eneray transfer between the
investigate membrane molecular interactions (rao and mayor, 2005; loura

et al,, 2010; loura and prieto, 2011). by modifying the target membrane
partner with a donor and acceptor fluorophore, respectively, once two
molecules are in close proximity (<10 nm), the energy transfer between the
donor and acceptor results in a strong fret signal. for example, fret has
been used to discover specific membrane interactions between
sphingomyelin and the p24 protein (contreras et al., 2012), as well as the
membrane domain formation during the interactions of n-ras and k-ras4b
oncoproteins (li et al., 2019),

fret is often combined with fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy
(flim) to study membrane transient interactions (lléres et al., 2007; liu et al.
2012; gagnon et al., 2017). in flim-fret, the energy transfer between the
fret donor and acceptor results in a fluorescence lifetime decrease of the
donor fluorophore. compared with fluorescence intensity-based
measurement, flim-fret is advantageous of being independent of the
membrane concentration of target molecules (wallrabe and periasamy,
2005). this feature is critical considering the heterogeneity and diverse
distribution patterns of lipids and proteins. for example, the effect of various
mutations and chemical inhibitors in modulating transient interactions
between membrane-bound antiapoptotic bcl-2 protein and proapoptotic
bh3 protein has been measured using flim-fret (liu et al., 2012; osterlund
et al, 2015; figure 4b).

in addition to fret, distance-dependent non-fret quenching has also been
urestsruteank ascent intaserdansinjivenel ramhwees! valve obabruie
et al, 2015; figure 4b).

in addition to fret, distance-dependent non-fret quenching has also been
used to track transient interactions in live cell membranes (artetxe et al.
2013). for example, fluorophore- and quencher-labeled lipid pairs were used
to study the impact of head group size of sphingolipids and ceramide on
their interactions with membrane cholesterols (artetxe et al,, 2013). in these
fret or quencher approaches, both target molecules are needed to be
fused with fluorophore or quencher at a specific location to ensure close
proximity during interactions. meanwhile, the limited signal-to-noise ratio
has prevented the application of these fret methods for imaging some
really transient (submillisecond) membrane interactions.
meanwhile, because normally tirf is performed close to the surface of the
coverslip, it is mainly capable of studying the surface-attached part of the
target cells (hell et al., 2015), e.g,, the basal surface of epithelial cells but not
the apical side. considering that basal and apical cell membrane may have
different compositions and functions, tirf may only provide partially
representative information about the whole cell membrane. furthermore,
close proximity with the glass surface may also induce non-natural
protein/lipid organization and diffusion patterns.

super-resolution microscopy

fcs and fccs normally operate on a confocal microscope. however, limited
by the relatively big focal spot (~200 nm in diameter), it is challenging to
validate if these membrane interactions indeed happen on the molecular
level, especially in those small nanodomains. stimulated emission depletion
(sted) microscopy is a super-resolution approach that can be combined
with fcs to image interactions below the diffraction limit (honigmann et al.,
2014; saka et al., 2014: sevcsik et al., 2015; sezgin et al., 2019). using sted-
fcs, a 20-nm focal spot is accessible, which allows a better distinction
between membrane free diffusion and transient interactions (eggeling et al.,
2009).

sted-fcs has been used to monitor cholesterol-dependent membrane
diffusion and colocalization of sphingolipids and
glycosylphosphatidylinositol (gp!)-anchored proteins in living cells (eggeling
et al,, 2009; figure 38). these lipid moieties were found to be transiently
trapped in cholesterol-mediated complexes in a <20-nm-diameter area. in a
more recent study, the same authors applied scanning sted-fcs to

investigate the spatial distributions of these membrane cholesterol-lipid

trapped in cholesterol-mediated complexes in a <20-nm-diameter area. in a
more recent study, the same authors applied scanning sted-fcs to
investigate the spatial distributions of these membrane cholesterol-lipid
interactions. again, transient interaction hotspots across the cell membrane
were observed (honigmann et al., 2014). dynamic cholesterol-dependent
multiprotein membrane assemblies can also be visualized with sted-fcs
(saka et al., 2014).

in addition to sted, other single-molecule imaging and super-resolution
techniques, such as total internal reflection fluorescence (tirf) microscopy,
structured illumination microscopy, and photoactivated localization
microscopy, have also been used to study membrane transient interactions
(hess et al., 2007; galbraith and galbraith, 2011). considering that the short-
lived interactions usually do not result in many accumulated signals over a
large membrane plane, microscopes of high spatial resolution and single-
molecule sensitivity are useful techniques in our understanding of these
heterogeneous and transient interactions. however, jis—ms range membrane
transient interactions are often still too fast to be analyzed based on single-
molecule imaging or colocalization methods. many super-resolution
techniques have to sacrifice the temporal resolution to obtain spatially
resolved information (westphal et al., 2008; galbraith and galbraith, 2011)

with fast image acquisition, high signal-to-noise ratio, and spatial resolution,
tirf is a popular approach to monitor dynamic motions and interactions in

with fast image acquisition, high signal-to-noise ratio, and spatial resolution,
tirf is a popular approach to monitor dynamic motions and interactions in
live cell (suzuki et al,, 2012; stender et al., 2013). using bright and
photostable fluorophores, transient colocalization as short as microseconds
can be detected in tirf. for example, transient homodimerization of gpi-
anchored proteins was found as critical organization unit for membrane
domain formation (suzuki et al., 2012; figure 4a). while, interestingly,
somewhat controversial result was shown in another tirf-based study,
which indicated that gpi-anchored proteins were not found to partition in
the membrane domains (sevcsik et al., 2015), this discrepancy may indicate
that it is still challenging to precisely measure membrane transient
interactions based on simply monitoring the trajectory of each single
molecule.
fcs and fccs are not suitable for monitoring slowly moving membrane
particles, though. in this case, the number of interactions within the focal
spot is hardly sufficient to obtain good statistics; meanwhile, the
fluorophores can be easily bleached before leaving the focal spot (triffo et
al, 2012). traditional fccs can assess only tiny focal spots rather than the
whole membrane area. to assess a large membrane, temporal and spatial
correlation analysis can be combined with scanning fcs/fccs now (ruan et
alop.ar. fog we

at, 2012). traditional fccs can assess only tiny focal spots rather than the
whole membrane area. to assess a large membrane, temporal and spatial
correlation analysis can be combined with scanning fcs/fccs now (ruan et
al., 2004).

fluorescence correlation spectroscopy and cross-correlation
spectroscopy

the development of fluorescence techniques has revolutionized membrane
biophysical studies (triffo et al., 2012; martinez-moro et al., 2019).
fluorescence methods enable the real-time study of dynamic phenomena in
living cell membranes with high temporal and spatial resolution. here, we
will discuss some fluorescence spectroscopy and microscopy approaches
that have been used to study transient interactions in the cell membranes.

the first method is based on fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (fcs).
fcs can be used to analyze the concentrations, motilities, and interactions
of membrane fluorescent-labeled compounds (haustein and schwille,
2003; bacia et al., 2006). it works by measuring fluorescence fluctuations in
a tiny focal spot. membrane complex formation results in changes in the
mobility. in order to obtain reliable interaction information in fcs, a large-
molecular-weight difference (usually >eight-fold) between bound and
unbound state is needed. to study membrane interactions between
molecules of similar molecular weight, fluorescence cross-correlation
cnectrnerany (eccs) can he a nnad antinn eccs meaciirac the flict afinne
molecular-weight difference (usually >eight-fold) between bound and
unbound state is needed. to study membrane interactions between
molecules of similar molecular weight, fluorescence cross-correlation
spectroscopy (fccs) can be a good option. fccs measures the fluctuations
and correlations of two fluorescent-labeled partners in the same focal spot
(bacia et al., 2006; bacia and schwille, 2007). if these two molecules
interact, even transiently, they will diffuse together and exhibit a positive
cross-correlation signal.

fccs has become a popular method to study, at the single-molecule level,
membrane dynamic interactions (bacia et al., 2006; sadamoto and muto,
2013; ma et al., 2014; martinez-moro et al., 2019). fccs is able to report the
correlated diffusion and binding stoichiometry over multiple time scales
(10-7-10+ s) (bacia et al., 2006). for example, fccs has been used to study
the regulation effect of cardiolipin and phosphatidyiglycerol on the dynamic
oligomerization of mitochondrial membrane voltage-dependent anion
channel (betaneli et al., 2012). in another example, snare proteins were
found to prefer incorporating into disordered membrane domains (bacia et
al., 2004). as an example for measuring transient protein-protein
interactions in live cell membranes, pulsed-interleaved excitation fccs was
used to investigate anchor-mediated dynamic colocalization of lymphocyte
cell kinase, rhoa, and k-ras proteins (figure 3a; triffo et al., 2012)
mass spectrometry

mass spectrometry (ms) is another common method to study membrane
dynamic interactions (konijnenberg et al., 2014; gupta et al., 2017, 2018;
bolla et al., 2019; frick and schmidt, 2019). ms does not provide high-
resolution target structure, but it can measure the mass and stoichiometry of
the complex (pyle et al., 2018; frick and schmidt, 2019). among different
types of ms, hydrogen-deuterium exchange ms (hdx-ms) has gained much
attention for studying transient (millisecond range) protein conformational
changes (rist et al., 2005; giladi and khananshvili, 2020). for example, hdx-
ms has been used to study how transient lipid-protein interactions can
induce conformational and functional changes of bacterial leucine
transporter leut (adhikary et al., 2017), rhomboid protease gipg (reading et
al, 2017), and various secondary transporters (martens et al., 2018). in hdx-
ms, labile hydrogens in the protein complex can be exchanged with
deuterium. the mass uptake at different locations of the complex will then
be measured and mapped to allow visualization of its structural dynamics
(figure 2b; martens et al., 2019; giladi and khananshvili, 2020). high-purity
samples are desirable but not essential, because the contaminants can be
easily ruled out during data processing (martens et al., 2019).

hdx-ms is still limited with some shortcomings. first, hdx-ms reports the
changes in the protein uptake of deuterium, not directly the complex
conformation. for a 50-kda protein, analyzing and converting one set of
data ta the ranfnrmatinnal channas maw tale 7 dave (martenc at al 2010)
hdx-ms is still limited with some shortcomings. first, hdx-ms reports the
changes in the protein uptake of deuterium, not directly the complex
conformation. for a 50-kda protein, analyzing and converting one set of
data to the conformational changes may take ~2 days (martens et al., 2019)
detergents are normally used to extract membrane protein complexes in ms
studies. however, affected by the choice of detergent, the obtained results
may not represent the native structure of membrane complexes. membrane-
mimic lipid nanostructures, such as picodiscs, nanodiscs, styrene maleic acid
lipid particles, bicelles, and liposomes (grinkova et al., 2010; diirr et al,
2012; marty et al., 2016; frick and schmidt, 2019), have been developed to
alleviate this problem, while the effect of these artificial lipid structures
should be still carefully considered.

secondary ion ms (sims) has been used to image lipid distributions in the cell
membranes. for example, by metabolically incorporating isotopic form of
lipids, sims allows the imaging of sphingolipid and cholesterol distributions
in the membrane domains, with a resolution of <l00 nm (mcquaw et al.,
2007; he et al, 2017; kraft, 2017). compared to fluorescent labeling as
mentioned below, such isotope labeling has less impact on the natural
membrane properties of the target lipids. sims can indirectly verify lipid—lipid
or lipid—protein interactions by quantifying target lipid distributions and
transitions upon addition and depletion of the partner lipids or proteins
(mcquaw et al., 2007; he et al., 2017). however, sims cannot directly assess
membrane interactions, especially those being transient. in addition, sims is

not suitable for live-cell studies. cells need to be dehydrated first, and the

membrane interactions, especially those being transient. in addition, sims is
not suitable for live-cell studies. cells need to be dehydrated first, and the
measurements are performed in vacuum.
mass spectrometry

mass spectrometry (ms) is another common method to study membrane
however, it is still difficult to use nmr to characterize structures of large-
molecular-weight complexes. appropriate kinetic models should also be
carefully chosen to convert the obtained nmr data into accurate interaction
parameters (furukawa et al., 2016). in this regard, a relevant strategy based
on site-directed spin labeling electron paramagnetic resonance (epr)
spectroscopy can be advantageous for the more direct study of membrane
transient interactions (subczynski et al., 2010; zhang et al., 2011). however,
both nmr and epr are still challenging to be directly applied for studying
interactions in live cell membranes. the differences between real cell
membrane environment and in vitro conditions have to be considered.

nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy

x-ray crystallography and electron microscopy can provide valuable
structural information about stable membrane protein-lipid complexes
(zhou et al., 2001; nooren and thornton, 2003). however, these methods
are normally not suitable for studying transient interactions or
conformational changes. in comparison, nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr)
spectroscopy is better for analyzing structure and dynamics of membrane
transient complexes (diaz-moreno et al., 2005; dannatt et al., 2016; purslow
et al,, 2020). thermodynamic information such as the binding affinities of
membrane partners can also be measured in nmr (purslow et al., 2020).

chemical shift of proteins is very sensitive to the local electronic
environment. as a result, changes in the chemical shift can be used for the
nmr analysis of protein complex formation and structure (ahuja et al., 2013;
figure 24). for example, chemical shift perturbation is a suitable method for
studying transient interactions with 1»m—mm binding affinities (acuner
ozbabacan et al., 2011). in this method, a ?5n- or ?5c-labeled target protein
is titrated with different amounts of unlabeled binding partner. changes in
the two-dimensional (2d) heteronuclear single-quantum coherence spectra
are then used to calculate the binding affinity and binding site of the protein
complex. several other nmr-based methods have also been developed to
study membrane dynamic protein-protein interactions, such as solvent
paramagnetic relaxation enhancement, residual dipolar coupling, and
nuclear overhauser effect (vinogradova and qin, 2012; gell et al., 2017;
larsen et al, 2018).
methods to study membrane transient interactions

in the past few decades, several computational and experimental methods
have been developed to study membrane transient interactions (loura et al.,
2010; smith, 2012; corradi et al., 2019). with significant improvement in the
computing power and theoretical models, computational approaches can
now predict and explain many membrane short-lived interactions. dynamic
simulations have been applied to study various membrane interactions
(corradi et al., 2019; muller et al., 2019), such as the effect of lipid
environment on membrane channel functions (gu and de groot, 2020), the
impact of polyunsaturated fatty acids on lipid raft structure and distribution
(evental et al 2014) and linid-indticed croce-talle theaninh the laaflatc
(corradi et al., 2019; muller et al., 2019), such as the effect of lipid
environment on membrane channel functions (gu and de groot, 2020), the
impact of polyunsaturated fatty acids on lipid raft structure and distribution
(levental et al., 2016), and lipid-induced cross-talk through the leaflets
(bossa et al., 2015). there are several great reviews on using computational
methods to study membrane dynamic interactions (corradi et al., 2019;
muller et al., 2019; siebenmorgen and zacharias, 2020). here, we will mainly
discuss experimental methods that can be used to really detect and analyze
transient interactions in the cell membranes.
in addition to these transient protein—protein interactions, lipid-protein and
lipid—lipid interactions also play a major role in the cell membrane fluidity,
curvature, and domain formation (leikin et al., 1996; aimon et al., 2014;
mcmahon and boucrot, 2015). these short-lived and transient lipid-
mediated interactions provide a mechanism allowing membrane
compounds to quickly respond to stimuli, yet retain the ability to return to
their original state. based on the structure and degree of saturation, lipids
tend to arrange themselves into either ordered or disordered domains (bakht
et al, 2007; kaiser et al., 2009; figure 18). in the case that a membrane
compound has similar binding affinities with several binding partners, by
forming these lipid domains, the high chance of colocalization with a
particular partner will clearly increase their opportunity of interactions. as a
result, specific membrane complexes can form because of high local
concentrations, despite their weak binding affinities.

for example, transient lipid interactions (in the range of sms) have resulted
in the formation of lipid rafts, i.e., small membrane domains that are usually
<200 nm in diameter (kolmakov et al, 2010; smith, 2012; sezgin et al.,
2017; bolmatov et al., 2020). cholesterols, sphingolipids, and various
proteins participate in these raft-like structures and regulate cellular
processes such as in immune signaling, host—pathogen interaction, cancer,
and cardiovascular diseases (lorizate et al., 2013; larsen et al., 2015;

varshney et al., 2016; stone et al., 2017; bolmatov et al., 2020)
proteins participate in these raft-like structures and regulate cellular

processes such as in immune signaling, host-pathogen interaction, cancer,
and cardiovascular diseases (lorizate et al, 2013; larsen et al., 2015;
varshney et al., 2016; stone et al., 2017; bolmatov et al., 2020).

lipids can also directly interact with proteins to define their membrane
structures and locations (sezgin et al., 2017; bolla et al., 2019). dependent
on the relative position of lipids to proteins, membrane lipids can be
categorized into three groups: annular, non-annular, and bulk (figure 1c;
lee, 2003; contreras et al., 2011; marius et al., 2012). bulk lipids function as
general membrane composition and usually have minimal interactions with
membrane proteins (lee, 2004). annular lipids can form a ring-shaped shell
that non-specifically surrounds membrane proteins (contreras et al., 2011)
in contrast, non-annular lipids can selectively occupy the cavities of proteins
and function as specific building blocks or cofactors for the target proteins.
both annular and non-annular lipid-protein interactions are largely mediated
by hydrophobic interactions. meanwhile, hydrophilic interactions between
polar amino acid chains and lipids’ head groups have further increased the
affinity and specificity of these lipid-protein conjugates (lee, 2004;
contreras et al., 2011). compared to the transient annular lipid-protein
interactions, many non-annular lipid-protein interactions are more stable
and long-lasting (lee, 2011; marius et al., 2012), e.g., as that happens during
the selective interactions between phosphatidylglycerol and the
homotetrameric potassium channel kesa (heginbotham et al., 1998;
valiyaveetil et al., 2002).

the selective interactions between phosphatidylglycerol and the
homotetrameric potassium channel kesa (heginbotham et al., 1998;
valiyaveetil et al., 2002).

we can also distinguish membrane lipid-protein interactions based on the
different categories of membrane proteins (figure 1c). integral membrane
proteins and lipid-anchored proteins can interact with lipids through
hydrophobic interactions. while peripheral proteins will normally interact
with lipids through transient binding with lipids’ head groups, different
strengths of these interactions can be used to define proteins’ locations and
functions. for example, proteins that specifically bind glycosphingolipids or
sphingomyelin can be recruited to the aforementioned membrane
nanodomains (fantini and yahi, 2010; pontier and schweisguth, 2012;
sezgin et al., 2017). during t-cell activation, cholesterol can selectively bind
to the resting tcr and activate the allosteric transition of the tcr complex
(swamy et al., 2016; figure 1d). meanwhile, the dynamic interactions
between cd28 and cholesterol or sphingomyelin also help recruit these
membrane proteins into the same submembrane domains of the tcr
complex for the efficient t-cell activation (kabouridis et al., 2000; yang et
al, 2017). these transient lipid-protein interactions are required to prevent
spurious tcr activation and ensure accurate membrane functions.

membrane lipid domains are also involved in cancer development and
progression. it has been shown that oncogenic proteins such as mucin 1 and
urokinase plasminogen activator surface receptor are centered in raft-like

membrane lipid domains are also involved in cancer development and
progression. it has been shown that oncogenic proteins such as mucin 1 and
urokinase plasminogen activator surface receptor are centered in raft-like
domains (staubach et al., 2009). mitogenic signaling is also initiated from cell
surface receptors in the lipid domains (heldin et al,, 2016; varshney et al.,
2016). in addition, by disrupting raft-like membrane domains, anticancer
drugs can be developed (gajate and mollinedo, 2007). similarly, lipid domain
partitions have also been observed in other health threats such as vascular
diseases (maguy et al., 2006). membrane transient interactions are indeed
important cellular events that require better understanding.
in addition to these transient protein-protein interactions, lipid-protein and

membrane functions. (a) during t-cell
signaling, the mhcp ligand binding induces
dynamic protein-protein interactions
between t-cell receptor (tcr) and cd4. (b)
the strength of lipid-lipid interactions
regulates membrane phase separation and
domain formation. white circles represent
that lipids prefer ordered domain. the darker

ability of these disordered phase-preferred
lipids to pack tightly. (c) the correlation
between membrane protein location and
their interactions with lipids. membrane lipids
can be thus categorized into three groups:

importance of membrane transient interactions

the first role of membrane transient interactions is to regulate the activation
or suppression of many membrane protein complexes (ikonen, 2008; larsen
et al,, 2015; sezgin et al, 2017). these protein complexes or
oligomerizations cannot function without transient binding and interactions
(heldin et al,, 1997; james et al., 2006). in membrane signaling network, the
same protein is often involved in forming more than one complex and need
to interact with different membrane partners. weak and transient
interactions will allow these membrane proteins to function in several
signaling and trafficking pathways simultaneously. in addition, intracellular
proteins can also be transiently recruited to the membrane to form dynamic

receptor complexes (sezgin et al., 2017; corradi et al., 2019). disruption of
interactions will allow these membrane proteins to function in several

signaling and trafficking pathways simultaneously. in addition, intracellular
proteins can also be transiently recruited to the membrane to form dynamic
receptor complexes (sezgin et al., 2017; corradi et al., 2019). disruption of
these fine-regulated membrane dynamic network will result in ineffective
signal transduction and cell damage (wymann and schneiter, 2008).

for example, the oligomerizations and functions of g-proteins and some
electron transport complexes are controlled by membrane local
environment (nooren and thornton, 2003; acuner ozbabacan et al., 2011;
sevesik et al., 2015). g-proteins regulate various metabolic, developmental,
humoral, and neuronal functions (simon et al., 1991). dependent on gtp
and gdp levels, g-protein subunits (a, b, y) can switch between stable
binding and transient interaction to modulate cellular reactions (neer and
clapham, 1988; ritter and hall, 2009). t-cell receptor (tcr) activation is
also fundamentally regulated by membrane transient interactions of several
protein subunits (figure 14). immediately after t-cell engagement to the
activating antigens, nanometer-sized tcr clusters are formed to function as
a platform for the recruitment and activation of downstream effectors such
as lat and slp-76 (bunnell et al., 2002; zal and gascoigne, 2004; yi et al.,
2019).
cell membranes are composed of various lipid, protein, and carbohydrate
compounds. these membrane components dynamically interact with each
other to regulate cell cycles and communications (lee, 2003; contreras et
al., 2011; varshney et al., 2016; sezgin et al., 2017). based on the affinity and
duration of these interactions, there are two types of membrane

interactions: strong/stable and weak/transient. strong/stable interactions last
for a long time with binding affinities in the range of fm to nm. in contrast,
weak/transient interactions happen only in the range of microseconds to
seconds, with a »m—mm binding affinity (de keersmaecker et al., 2018;
corradi et al. 2019). while it is worth mentioning that there is no absolute
clear cut between these two types of membrane interactions, many
membrane stable interactions have been well-studied, whereas in
comparison, those transient interactions are often more challenging to
investigate. this is because at any given time, only a small number of
membrane transient interactions happen. the formed short-lived complexes
are always under a dynamic equilibrium with monomers that will freely
diffuse in the membrane. meanwhile, these transient complexes are often
disrupted or overlooked during in vitro isolation and purification processes.

in this review, we will first discuss the biological importance of these
membrane transient interactions in regulating cellular functions. we will then
focus on available experimental methods that can be used to study these
transient interactions, especially in living cell membranes. we hope this
review can provide some useful guidelines for future cell membrane studies.

cell signaling and communication. many of these complexes are
formed based on low-affinity and transient interactions among
various lipids and proteins. new techniques have emerged to study
these previously overlooked membrane transient interactions.
exciting functions of these transient interactions have been
discovered in cellular events such as immune signaling, host
pathogen interactions, and diseases such as cancer. in this review,
we have summarized current experimental methods that allow us to
detect and analyze short-lived cell membrane protein-protein,
lipid-protein, and lipid-lipid interactions. these methods can
provide useful information about the strengths, kinetics, and/or
spatial patterns of membrane transient interactions. however, each
method also has its own limitations. we hope this review can be
used as a guideline to help the audience to choose proper
approaches for studying membrane transient interactions in
different membrane trafficking and cell signaling events.
