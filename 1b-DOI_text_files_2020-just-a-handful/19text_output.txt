the work that we have presented in this paper lies at the interface of causal inference ar
shape-constrained non-parametric inference, and there are natural future directions
building on developments in either of these areas. inference on a monotone causal dose
response curve when outcome data are only observed subject to potential coarsening, si
as censoring, truncation or missingness, is needed to increase the applicability of our
proposed method. to tackle such cases, it appears most fruitful to follow the general
primitive strategy that was described in westling and carone (2019) based ona revised
causal identification formula allowing such coarsening.

it would be useful to develop tests of the monotonicity assumption, like durot (2003) di
for regression functions. such a test could probably be developed by studying the large
sample behaviour of |¥,, — ¥,,|, under the null hypothesis that 6 is monotone, where §
and &, are the primitive estimator and its greatest convex minorant as defined in secti
2.2. such a result would probably permit testing with a given asymptotic size when 6y is
strictly increasing, and asymptotically conservative inference otherwise. it would also t
useful to develop methods for uniform inference. uniform inference is difficult in this
setting because {n!/{0,,(a) — a0(a)} : a € o/} does not convergence weakly as a proce:

the space 1*°(«/) of bounded functions on «/ to a tight limit process. indeed, theorem 3
indicates that {n'/*{6,(a) — 40(a)} : a € «/} converges to an independent white noise
process, which is not tight, so this convergence is not useful for constructing uniform
confidence bands. instead, it may be possible to extend the work of durot et al. (2012) tc
setting (and other generalized grenander-type estimators) by demonstrating that
log(n)|{n/log(n)}"/* supgeiy, |@n(a) — 40(a)|/a0 — en] converges in distribution to an
degenerate limit for some constant ao depending on po, a deterministic sequence , an
suitable sequence of subsets «/, increasing to «/. developing procedures for uniform
inference and tests of the monotonicity assumption are important areas for future rese

an alternative approach to estimating a causal dose-response curve is to use local linee
regression, like kennedy et al. (2017) did. as is true in the context of estimating classica
univariate functions such as density, hazard and regression functions, there are certain
trade-offs between local linear smoothing and monotonicity-based methods. on the or
hand, local linear regression estimators exhibit a faster n~°-rate of convergence when:
optimal tuning rates are used and the true function has two continuous derivatives.

however, the limit distribution involves an asymptotic bias term depending on the seco
derivative of the true function, so confidence intervals based on optimally chosen tunin
parameters provide asymptotically correct coverage only for a smoothed parameter rath
than the true parameter of interest. in contrast, monotonicity-constrained estimators s

derivative of the true function, so confidence intervals based on optimally chosen tunin
parameters provide asymptotically correct coverage only for a smoothed parameter rath
than the true parameter of interest. in contrast, monotonicity-constrained estimators
as the estimator that is proposed here exhibit a rate of convergence of n° whenever th
true function is strictly monotone and has one continuous derivative, do not require
choosing a tuning parameter, are invariant to strictly increasing transformations of the
exposure and their limit theory does not include any asymptotic bias (as illustrated by
theorem 2). we note that both estimators achieve the optimal rate of convergence for
pointwise estimation of a univariate function under their respective smoothness
constraints. in our view, the ability to perform asymptotically valid inference by using
monotonicity-constrained estimator is one of the most important benefits of leveragin
monotonicity assumption rather than using smoothing methods. this advantage was
evident in our numerical studies when comparing the isotonic estimator that is propose
here and the local linear method of kennedy et al. (2017). undersmoothing can be used
construct calibrated confidence intervals by using kernel smoothing estimators, but
performing adequate undersmoothing in practice is challenging.

 

 

the two methods for pointwise asymptotic inference that we presented require estimat
of the derivative 6,(a) and the scale parameter ro(a). we found that the plug-in estima
of xo(a) had low variance but possibly large bias depending on the levels of inconsisten
fi, and gn, and that its doubly robust estimator instead had high variance but low bias a
long as either pn, or gy is consistent. in practice, we found that the low variance of the p!

of xo(a) had low variance but possibly large bias depending on the levels of inconsisten
fi, and gn, and that its doubly robust estimator instead had high variance but low bias a
long as either pn, or gy is consistent. in practice, we found that the low variance of the p!
in estimator often outweighed its bias, resulting in better coverage rates for intervals bi
on the plug-in estimator of xo(a), especially in samples of small and moderate sizes.

whether a doubly robust estimator of xo(a) with smaller variance can be constructed is
important question to be addressed in future work. we found that sample splitting with
few as m = 5 splits provided doubly robust coverage, and the sample splitting estimator
had smaller variance than the original estimator, at the expense of some additional bia:

it would be even more desirable to have inferential methods that do not require estimat
of additional nuisance parameters or sample splitting. unfortunately, the standard non
parametric bootstrap is not generally consistent in grenander-type estimation settings
and, although alternative bootstrap methods have been proposed, to our knowledge, all
such proposals require the selection of critical tuning parameters (kosorok, 2008; sen
2010). likelihood-ratio-based inference for grenander-type estimators has proven fru
ina variety of contexts (see, for example, banerjee and wellner (2001) and groeneboon
jongbloed (2015)), and extending such methods to our context is also an area of signific
interest in future work.

associated with immune responses to vaccination (see, for example, sheridan et al. (201

al, (2017) found that obesity reduced hepatitis b immune responses through ‘leptin-
induced systemic and b cell intrinsic inflammation, impaired t cell responses and
lymphocyte division and proliferation’, given this evidence of a monotone effect of bm
immune responses, we used the methods that are presented in this paper to assess the
covariate-adjusted relationship between bmi and cd4+ t-cell responses using data fro
collection of clinical trials of candidate hiv vaccines. we present the results of our anal
here.

         

jin et al. (2015) compared the rate of cd4+ t cell response with hiv peptide pools amon
low (bmi <25) medium (25 < bmi <30) and high (bmi > 30) bmi participants, and they
found that low bmi participants had a statistically significantly greater response rate th
high bmi participants by using fisher’s exact test. however, such a marginal assessmet
the relationship between bmi and immune response can be misleading because there ai
known common causes, such as age and sex, of both bmi and immune response. for thi
reason, jin et al. (2015) also performed a logistic regression of the binary cd4+ respons:
against sex, age, bmi (not discretized), vaccination dose and number of vaccinations. it
this adjusted analysis, they found a significant association between bmi and cd4+ cell
response rate after adjusting for all other covariates (odd ratio 0.92; 95% confidence

interval 0.86, 0.98; p = 0.007). however, such an adjusted odds ratio has a formal causal
interpretation only under strong parametric assumptions. as discussed in section 1.2, tl
covariate-adjusted dose-response function 49 is identified with the causal dose—respo!
curve without making parametric assumptions and is therefore of interest for
understanding the continuous covariate-adjusted relationship between bmi and immu:
responses.

we note that there is some debate in the causal inference literature about whether
exposures such as bmi have a meaningful interpretation in formal causal modelling. in
particular, some researchers suggest that causal models should always be tied to
hypothetical randomized experiments (see, for example bind and rubin (2019), and it
difficult to imagine a hypothetical randomized experiment that would assign participar
to levels of bmi. from this perspective, it may therefore not be sensible to interpret 49
a causal manner in the context of this example. nevertheless, as discussed in section 1,
contend that 69(a) is still of interest. in particular, it provides a meaningful summary o
relationship between bmi and immune response accounting for measured potential
confounders. in this case, we interpret 8 (a) as the probability of immune response in a
population of participants with bmi-value a but sex, age, vaccination dose, number of
vaccinations and study with a similar distribution to that of the entire study population

that was presented in jin et al. (2015), and a detailed description of the trials are contain
therein. the final trial in our pooled analysis is hvtn 100, in which 210 participants we!
randomized to receive four doses of the alvac-hiv vaccine (vcp1521). the alvac-hiv
vaccine, in combination with an aidsvax boost, was found to have statistically signific
vaccine efficacy against hiv type 1 in the rv-144 trial that was conducted in thailand
(rerks-ngarm et al., 2009). cd4+ and cd8+ t-cell responses to hiv peptide pools were
measured in all 11 trials by using validated intracellular cytokine staining at hiv vaccine
trials network laboratories. these continuous responses were converted to binary
indicators of whether there was a significant change from baseline by using the method
described in jin et al. (2015). we analysed these binary responses at the first visit follow!
administration of the last vaccine dose—either 2 or 4 weeks after the final vaccination
depending on the trial. after accounting for missing responses from a small number of
participants, our analysis data sets consisted of a total of n = 439 participants for the

adjusted dose-response function 6 using our cross-fitted estimator 62, the local linea
estimator and the sample splitting version of our estimator with m = 5 splits. we adjust

constructed confidence intervals for our estimator by using both the plug-in and the do

as noted above, we found in our numerical experiments that the plug-in estimator of tt
scale parameter was surprisingly robust to inconsistent estimation of the nuisance
parameters, whereas its doubly robust estimator was anticonservative even when the
nuisance parameters were estimated consistently. this can be explained in terms of the
and variance of the two scale estimators proposed. on one hand, under inconsistent
estimation of any nuisance function, the plug-in estimator of the scale parameter is biz

 

 

even in large samples. however, its variance decreases relatively quickly with sample si
since it is a simple empirical average of estimated functions. on the other hand, the dou
robust estimator is asymptotically unbiased, but its variance decreases much slower wi
sample size. these trends can be observed in the figures that are provided in the on-lin
supplementary material. in sufficiently large samples, the doubly robust estimator is

expected to outperform the plug-in estimator in terms of mean-squared error when on

trade-off to affect confidence interval coverage significantly depends on the degree of
inconsistency. although we did not see this trade-off at the sample sizes that were use¢

limitations, we performed 1000 simulations at sample size n = 1000 only. fig. 5 shows tl
coverage of nominal 95% confidence intervals. the plug-in intervals achieve very close
nominal coverage under consistent estimation of both nuisances, and they also achieve
surprisingly good coverage rates when the propensity is inconsistently estimated. the
plug-in intervals are somewhat conservative when the outcome regression is inconsist:
estimated. the doubly robust method is anti-conservative under inconsistent estimatio
both nuisances and also when the propensity is inconsistently estimated, with coverage
rates mostly between 90% and 95%. good coverage rates are also achieved when the
outcome regression is inconsistently estimated. these results suggest that the doubly
robust intervals may require larger sample sizes to achieve good coverage, particularly

rates mostly between 90% and 95%. good coverage rates are also achieved when the
outcome regression is inconsistently estimated. these results suggest that the doubly
robust intervals may require larger sample sizes to achieve good coverage, particularly
when machine learning estimators are used for jzn and gy. the plug-in intervals appear

given w. however, since our estimation procedures requires estimating the conditional
density of u: = f(a) given w, we instead generate u given w, and then transform u to ol
a. this strategy makes it easier to construct correctly specified parametric nuisance
estimators in the context of these simulations. given w = w, we generate u from the
distribution with conditional density function go(u|w) = ijoa)(u)[a(w) + 2u{1 — a(w)}

also, that f go(u|w)qo(dw) = iioa\(w), so that u is marginally uniform. we then take at
the evaluation at u of the quantile function of an equal weight mixture of two normal
distributions with means -2 and 2 and standard deviation 1, which implies that a is
marginally distributed according to this bimodal normal mixture. finally, conditionally

either estimate 04 and f, separately and consider the ratio of these estimators, or that w
could instead estimate wh directly and compose it with the estimator of f, that is alread
available. the latter approach has the desirable property that the resulting scale estima
is invariant to strictly monotone transformations of the exposure. as such, this is the
strategy that we favour. to estimate 7p}, we recall that the estimator yy from section 2 is
step function and is therefore not differentiable. a natural solution consists of computi
the derivative of a smoothed version of y,. we have found local quadratic kernel smoot

3.7 use of cross-fitting to avoid empirical process conditions

theorems 1 and 2 reveal that the statistical properties of 9, depend on the nuisance

estimators jin and g, in two important ways. first, we require in condition 1 that in or g
fall in sufficiently small classes of functions, as measured by metric entropy, to control
certain empirical process remainder terms. second, we require in conditions 2 and 3 the
least one of jz, or gn be consistent almost everywhere (for consistency), and in conditio

that the product of their rates of convergence be faster than n>

(for convergence in
distribution). in observational studies, researchers can rarely specify a priori correct
parametric models for jig and go. this motivates use of data-adaptive estimators of the:
nuisance functions to meet the second requirement. however, such estimators often le
violations of the first requirement, or it may be onerous to determine that they do not.

thus, because it may be difficult to find nuisance estimators that are both sufficiently d

nuisance functions to meet the second requirement. however, such estimators often lez
violations of the first requirement, or it may be onerous to determine that they do not.
thus, because it may be difficult to find nuisance estimators that are both sufficiently d
adaptive to meet required rates of convergence and fall in sufficiently small function ck
to make empirical process terms negligible, simultaneously satisfying these two
requirements can be challenging in practice.

in the context of asymptotically linear estimators, it has been noted that cross-fitting
nuisance estimators can resolve this challenge by eliminating empirical process conditi
(zheng and van der laan, 2011; belloni et al., 2018; kennedy, 2019). we therefore propos
employ cross-fitting of ,, and g, in the estimation of pg to avoid entropy conditions in
theorems 1 and 2. specifically, we fix v € {2, 3, ..., n/2} and suppose that the indices {1, 2
n} are randomly partitioned into v sets ¥,.), yn2,.- -; yay. we assume for convenience th
n: = n/vis an integer and that |¥%,,|= n for each v, but all our results hold as long as.
max, n/|%y| = op(1). for each v € {1, 2, ..., v}, we define j, = {o; :i ¢ yay} as the
training set for fold v and denote by pp, y and gp, y the nuisance estimators that are
constructed by using only the observations from j,,. we then define pointwise the cros
fitted estimator f° of pg as

as we now demonstrate, utilizing the cross-fitted estimator 62 enables us to avoid the
empirical process condition 1, we first introduce the following two conditions, which at
analogues of conditions 1 and 2.

condition 6

there exist constants c’, 6", kj, k1, k}, kj € (0,00) such that, almost surely as n

respectively, satisfying

(b) o3(a,w) < k} for almost all a and w.

there exist jr. € f,and gx, € f{ such that max, po(pny — foo)? 3” oand
maxy po(jny ~ joo)” +? 0.

we then have the following analogue of theorem 1 establishing consistency of the cross
fitted estimator 6°.

theorem 4
(consistency of the cross-fitted estimator)

if conditions 6 and 7 and 3 hold, then 6% (a) ++? (a) for any a € of such that
f(a) € (0, 1), 9 is continuous at a, and fy is strictly increasing ina
neighbourhood of a. if 6 is uniformly continuous and f is strictly increasing on
a, then supacuy, |92(a) — 90(a)] >” 0 for any bounded strict subinterval % © «/.

for convergence in distribution, we introduce the following analogue of condition 4.
condition 8
there exists ¢y > 0 such that
(a) max,max {d(lnps hoos 4; £051); (ynys goo a £0) a2)} = o(n-"4),
thére exists ¢y > 0such that ee

(b) max,max {d(p1n,5 hoo; @ 05-72); (ynys joos 4s €0) at) } = or(1) and
(6) maxy e({nps hoo} @ £0 73)4(gnys joos 4s £0; -%3) = (ns)
we then have the following analogue of theorem 2 for the cross-fitted estimator 42.
theorem 5

(convergence in distribution for the cross-fitted estimator)

if conditions 6, 7, 3, 8 and 5 hold, then n'/*{6°(a) — 60(a)} + {470(a)}!/*w for
any a € of such that fy(a) € (0, 1).

the conditions of theorems 4 and 5 are analogous to those of theorems 1 and 2, with the
important exception that the entropy condition 1(b) is no longer required. therefore, th
estimators fin, y and gn, y may be as data adaptive as one desires without concern for
empirical process terms, as long as they satisfy the boundedness conditions that are sta
in condition 6.

in many applications, in addition to the causal dose-response curve a»mo(a) itself, cat
effects of the form (a,, a3)+mo(a,) ~ mo(az) are of scientific interest as well. under the
identification conditions that were discussed in section 1.2 applied to each of a, and a,
causal effects are identified with the observed data parameter (a1) — 6 (ay). anatura
estimator for such a causal effect in our setting is 6,(a,) ~ ¢n(a2). if the conditions of
theorem 1 hold for both a, and a,, then the continuous mapping theorem implies that
@n(ax) — @n(a2) +? 89(a1) — @0(a2). however, since theorem 2 provides only marginal
distributional results, and thus does not describe the joint convergence of

zn (a1, a2) := (n*/8{n(a1) — 8(a1)},n™/{on(a2) — 60(a2)}), it cannot be used to
determine the large sample behaviour of n¥/[{4,,(a1) — 8n(a2)} — {80(a1) — 80(a2)}]."
following result demonstrates that such joint convergence can be expected under the
aforementioned conditions, and that the bivariate limit distribution of z,(a,, a3) has
independent components.

theorem 3
(joint convergence in distribution)

if conditions 1-5 hold for a € {a1,a2} c / and fo(a1), fo(a2) € (0,1), then
zn(dy, 42) converges in distribution to ({470(a1)}/*w1, {470(a2)}"/*we), where

theorem 3 implies that, under the conditions stated,

the large sample properties of 4),, including doubly robust consistency and convergenc
distribution at the regular parametric rate n-’”, are well established (robins et al., 1994
therefore, many properties of 6, in this case can be determined by using the results of
westling et al. (2018), who studied the behaviour of the isotonic correction of an initial
estimator. in particular, maxace |@n(a) — 0(a)| <maxeca |61(a) — a(a)| as long as 4

has flat regions, then 6, is more efficient than @) on these regions, and confidence inter
centred near 6, but based on the limit theory for 61, will be conservative.
3.5 discrete domains

in some circumstances, the exposure a is discrete rather than continuous. our estimato
works equally well in these cases, since, as we highlight below, it turns out then to be
asymptotically equivalent to the well-studied aipw estimator. as a result, the large san
properties of our estimator can be derived from the large sample properties of the aipv
estimator, and asymptotically valid inference can be obtained by using standard influer
function-based techniques.

suppose that «/ = {a1 < az <... < am} and foj := po(a = aj) > oforallj € {1,2,...
and 5", foj = 1. our estimation procedure remains the same with one exception: in
defining go: = no/fo, we now take mr to be the conditional probability

xro(aj|w) := po(a = a;|w = w) rather than the corresponding conditional density, and
take f, as the marginal probability fo(aj) := p(a = a;) = fo; rather than the
corresponding marginal density. we then set gq: = n/fn as the estimator of go, where mq,

it is natural to ask how &,, compares with the estimator 6, that we have studied thus far.

conditions 1-5 under which
   

3.4 grenander-type estimation without domain transformation

as indicated earlier, the isotonic regression estimator based on estimated pseudo-
outcomes coincides with a generalized grenander-type estimator for which the margin
exposure empirical distribution function is used as domain transformation. an alternat
estimator could be constructed via grenander-type estimation without the use of any
femal transformation. specifically, we let a_,a, € r be fixed, and we define
= j 69(u)du. under regularity conditions, for a < a,, the one-step estimator of

ko(a) := 24(£0 [geet + bo (a) } 1a =a] n(a,¥7))

with ,,(a) denoting f j1co(a, w)qo(dw).

we note that the limit distribution in theorem 2 is the same as that of the standard isot
regression estimator up toa scale factor. as noted above, when either

(a) yand ware independent given a or
(b) ais independent of w,

the functions 4 and r coincide. as such, we can directly compare the respective limit
distributions of n!/*{6,,(a) — 69(a)} and n”*{r,(a) - ro(a)} under these conditions. whe
both piss = 10 and go = go, fn(a) is asymptotically more concentrated than @,(a) in
scenario (a), and less concentrated in scenario (b). this is analogous to findings in linec
regression, where including a covariate that is uncorrelated with the outcome inflates t
standard error of the estimator of the coefficient corresponding to the exposure, where
including a covariate that is correlated with the outcome but uncorrelated with the expc
deflates its standard error.

the set .%s where both i and g, are consistent, only the product of their rates of

long as at least one of the nuisance estimators is consistent at a rate faster than n™, ev
the other nuisance estimator is inconsistent. this suggests the possibility of performin,
doubly robust inference for 60(a), ie. of constructing confidence intervals and tests bas
on 6,(a) with valid calibration even when one of yg and gy is inconsistently estimated. t
is explored in section 4. finally, as in theorem 1, we allow that neither 1», nor g, be
consistent everywhere, as long as for (fp x qo) almost every (a, w) at least one of j1y of ¢

number of l(q) balls of radius less than or equal to « needed to cover f. the uniform
entropy of f is then defined as log|supg n{, ¥, l2(q)}), where the supremum is take
over all finite discrete probability measures. for a thorough treatment of covering num
and their role in empirical process theory, we refer readers to van der vaart and wellne1

() ho0(@, w) = ho(a,w) and goo(a,w) = go(a,w) for all (a, w) € 7%.
under these three conditions, we have the following result.
theorem 1
(consistency)

if conditions 1-3 hold, then 8,,(a) >” 60(a) for any value a € / such that

f(a) € (0, 1), 9 is continuous at a and fy is strictly increasing in a
neighbourhood of a. if 69 is uniformly continuous and fy is strictly increasing on
a, then suai, |9n(a) — 90(a)] >” 0 for any bounded strict subinterval % © «/.

we note that in the nnintwise statement of thearem1 f(a) is reanired to he in the inte
neighbourhood of a. if 60 is uniformly continuous and fy is strictly increasing on

a, then suai, |9n(a) — 90(a)] >” 0 for any bounded strict subinterval % © «/.

we note that, in the pointwise statement of theorem 1, f(a) is required to be in the inte
of [0, 1] and, similarly, the uniform statement of theorem 1 covers only strict subintervé
this is due to the well-known boundary issues with grenander-type estimators. var
remedies have been proposed in particular settings, and it would be interesting to consi
these in future work (see, for example, woodroofe and sun (1993), balabdaoui et al. (20
and kulikov and lopuhaa (2006)).

condition 1 requires that ,, and g,, eventually be contained in uniformly bounded funct
classes that are sufficiently small for certain empirical process terms to be controlled. 1
condition is easily satisfied if, for instance, % and f; are parametric classes. it is also
satisfied for many infinite dimensional function classes. uniform entropy bounds for m
such classes may be found in chapter 2.6 of van der vaart and wellner (1996). we note t
there is an asymmetry between the entropy requirements for fy and f; in part (b) of
condition 1. this is due to the term f f°, n(u, w)fn(du) qn (dw) appearing in r,(a).t
control this term, we use an upper bound of the form fj, logisupg n{e, fo, la(q)}]de f
the theory of empirical u-processes (nolan and pollard, 1987)—this contrasts with the
uniform entropy integral f,' (logisupg n{e, ¥, l2(q)}])"/?de that bounds ordinary
empirical processes indexed by a uniformly bounded class 7. in section 3.7, we conside
the use of cross-fitting to avoid the entropy conditions in condition 1.

condition 2 requires that in and g, tend to limit functions jis and gsc, and condition 3
requires that either j1x,(a,w) = f19(a, w) of g5.(a, w) = go(a, w) for (fo x qo) almost eve

(a) a and .~% are null sets or
(b) 2 and yy are null sets,

then condition 3 is known simply as double robustness of the estimator 6, relative to the
nuisance functions jig and go: én is consistent as long as jus: = 0 of goo = go. doubly rol
estimators are at this point a mainstay of causal inference and have been studied for ove
two decades (see, for example, robins et al. (1994), rotnitzky et al. (1998), scharfstein ¢
(1999), van der laan and robins (2003), neugebauer and van der laan (2005) and bang
robins (2005)). however, condition 3 is more general than classical double robustness,
allows neither j1,, nor g, to tend to their true counterparts over the whole domain, as lor
at least one of jzn or gq tends to the truth for almost every point in the domain.
3.1 invariance to strictly increasing exposure transformations

an important feature of the estimator proposed is that, as with the isotonic regression
estimator, it is invariant to any strictly increasing transformation of a. this is a desirab
property because the scale of a continuous exposure is often arbitrary from a statistical
perspective. for instance, if a is temperature, whether a is measured in degrees fahrenl

greatest convex minorants (gcms). the gcm of a bounded function fon an interval [a, |

empirical distribution function of ay, ap, ..., an, f(a) can be shown to equal the left

the isotonic regression estimator r,, has many attractive properties. first, unlike
smoothing-based estimators, isotonic regression does not require the choice of a kerne

where the outer expectation is with respect to the marginal distribution qo of w. in som
scientific contexts, @9(a) may have a causal interpretation. adopting the neyman—rubi

under varying sets of causal conditions, mo(a) may be identified with functionals of the

suppose that

(a) each unit’s potential outcomes are independent of all other units’ exposures, and

(b) the observed outcome ¥ equals the potential outcome y(a) corresponding to the
exposure level a that is actually received.

identification of mo(a) further depends on the relationship between a and y(a). if
assumptions (a) and (b) hold and, in addition,

(a) aand y(a) are independent, and
(b) the marginal density of a is positive at a,

then mo(a) = ro(a). condition (c) typically holds in experimental studies only (e.g.
randomized trials). in observational studies there are often common causes of a and y(
so-called confounders of the exposure—outcome relationship—that induce dependence.
such cases, mo(a) and ro(a) do not generally coincide. however, if w contains a sufficier
rich collection of confounders, it may still be possible to identify mo(a) from the observ
data. if assumptions (a) and (b) hold and, in addition,

(a) aand y(a) are conditionally independent given w, and
(b) the conditional density of a given wis almost surely positive at a= a,

then mo(a) = 60(a). this is a fundamental result in causal inference (robins, 1986; gill
robins, 2001). whenever mo(a) = 6(a), our methods can be interpreted as drawing
inference on the causal dose-response parameter mo(a).

we note that the definition of the counterfactual outcome ¥(a) presupposes that the
intervention setting a = a is uniquely defined. in many situations, this stipulation requi
careful thought. for example, in section 6 we consider an application in which body ma
index bmi is the exposure of interest. there is an on-going scientific debate about whet
such an exposure leads to a meaningful causal interpretation, since it is not clear what
means to intervene on bmi.

 

even if the identifiability conditions that were stipulated above do not strictly hold or th
scientific question is not causal in nature, when wis associated with both a and y, 60(a)
often has a more appealing interpretation than the unadjusted regression function ro(a
specifically, 40(a) may be interpreted as the average value of yin a population with

when p(a = a) = 0, the parameter p#p(a) is not pathwise differentiable at py with
respect to the non-parametric model (diaz and van der laan, 2011). heuristically, beca
of the continuous nature of a, 6p(a) corresponds to a local feature of p. as a result, regul
root-n-rate estimators cannot be expected, and standard methods for constructing
efficient estimators of pathwise differentiable parameters in non-parametric and
semiparametric models (e.g. estimating equations, one-step estimation or targeted
minimum loss-based estimation) cannot be used directly to target and obtain inference
60(a).

1.1 motivation and literature review

questions regarding the causal effect of an exposure on an outcome are ubiquitous in
science. if investigators can carry out an experimental study in which they randomly as
a level of exposure to each participant and then measure the outcome of interest,

estimating a causal effect is generally straightforward. however, such studies are often

feasible. and data from observational studies must be relied on instead, assessing causa
science. if investigators cali carry olit an experimental study in which they rahaomy as

a level of exposure to each participant and then measure the outcome of interest,
estimating a causal effect is generally straightforward. however, such studies are often
feasible, and data from observational studies must be relied on instead. assessing causa
is then more difficult, in large part because of potential confounding of the relationship
between exposure and outcome. many non-parametric methods have been proposed fo
drawing inference about a causal effect by using observational data when the exposure
interest is either binary or categorical—these include, among others, inverse-probabili
weighted estimators (horvitz and thompson, 1952), augmented inverse-probability-
weighted (aipw) estimators (scharfstein et al., 1999; bang and robins, 2005) and targe
minimum-loss-based estimators (van der laan and rose, 2011).

in practice, many exposures are continuous, in the sense that they may take any value i
interval. a common approach to dealing with such exposures is simply to discretize the
interval into two or more regions, thus returning to the categorical exposure setting.
however, it is frequently of scientific interest to learn the causal dose-response curve,
which describes the causal relationship between the exposure and outcome across a
continuum of the exposure. much less attention has been paid to continuous exposures
robins (2000) and zhang et al. (2016) studied this problem by using parametric models

projecting a causal dose-response curve onto a parametric working model. other

projecting a causal dose-response curve onto a parametric working model. other
researchers have taken a non-parametric approach instead. rubin and van der laan (2
and diaz and van der laan (2011) discussed non-parametric estimation using flexible d
adaptive algorithms. kennedy et al. (2017) proposed an estimator based on local linear
smoothing, finally, van der laan et al. (2018) have recently presented a general framew
for inference on parameters that fail to be sufficiently smooth as a function of the data-
generating distribution and for which regular root-n-estimation theory is therefore no
available. this is indeed the case for the causal dose-response curve, and van der laan.
(2018) discussed inference on such a parameter as a particular example.

despite a growing body of literature on non-parametric estimation of causal dose—
response curves, to the best of our knowledge, existing methods do not permit valid lar
sample inference and may be sensitive to the selection of certain tuning parameters. fo
instance, smoothing-based methods are often sensitive to the choice of a kernel functic
and bandwidth, and these estimators typically have non-negligible asymptotic bias, wt
complicates the task of performing valid inference

in many settings, it may be known that the causal dose-response curve is monotone in
exposure. for instance, exposures such as daily exercise performed, cigarettes smoked
week and air pollutant levels are all known to have monotone relationships with variou
health outcomes. in such cases, an extensive literature suggests that monotonicity may

week and air pollutant levels are all known to have monotone relationships with variou
health outcomes. in such cases, an extensive literature suggests that monotonicity may
leveraged to derive estimators with desirable properties—groeneboom and jongbloed
(2014) provides a comprehensive overview. for example, in the absence of confounding
isotonic regression may be employed to estimate the causal dose-response curve (barl
al., 1972). the isotonic regression estimator does not require selection of a kernel funct
or bandwidth, is invariant to strictly increasing transformations of the exposure and on
centring and scaling by n°, converges in law pointwise to a symmetric limit distributi
with mean o (brunk, 1970). the convergence property is useful since it facilitates
asymptotically valid pointwise inference.

non-parametric inference on a monotone dose-response curve when the exposure—
outcome relationship is confounded is more difficult to tackle and is the focus of this pa

in observational studies, potential confounders may distort the causal relationship
between an exposure and an outcome. however, under some conditions, a causal
dose-response curve can be recovered by using the g-computation formula. most
classical methods for estimating such curves when the exposure is continuous rely o1
restrictive parametric assumptions, which carry significant risk of model
misspecification. non-parametric estimation in this context is challenging because i
a non-parametric model these curves cannot be estimated at regular rates. many
available non-parametric estimators are sensitive to the selection of certain tuning
parameters, and performing valid inference with such estimators can be difficult. we
propose a non-parametric estimator of a causal dose-response curve known to be
monotone. we show that our proposed estimation procedure generalizes the classica
least squares isotonic regression estimator of a monotone regression function.
specifically, it does not involve tuning parameters and is invariant to strictly
monotone transformations of the exposure variable. we describe theoretical
properties of our proposed estimator, including its irregular limit distribution and th
potential for doubly robust inference. furthermore, we illustrate its performance via

numerical studies and use it toassess the relationshi een hadv mass index and
