‘abstract

research with the theory of planned behavior (tpb) has typically treated attitude (att), subjective norm (sn), and perceived behavioral con
(pbc) as independent predictors of intention (int). however, theoretically, pbc moderates the effects of att and sn on intention. in th
studies dealing with different behaviors (voting, reducing household waste, and energy consumption) we show that greater pbc tend:
strengthen the relative importance of att in the prediction of intention, whereas it tends to weaken the relative importance of sn. the la
pattern was observed in relation to injunctive as well as descriptive subjective norms, and it may help explain the relatively weak rela
between sn and int frequently observed in tpb studies.
