properties of two bioactive components from antrodia camphorata(ac), a rare
medicinal mushroom natively grown in taiwan and commonly used in chinese the
traditional medicine. the anti-inflammatory and antitumorigenic functions of ™ american
antroquinonol (aq) and 4-acetylantroquinonol b (4-aaqb) from ac were examined wy joumal
on breast cancer cell line mce-7 with/without tnf-a stimulation. among nine é of
inflammatory mediators (il6, il10, il18, ifny, ptgs2, tgf1, tnf-a, ccl2 oe, chinese
andcsf 1) examined, aq inhibited two of them (il-10 and ptgs2), while 4-aaqb 4 medicine
inhibited three of them (il-10, ptgs2 andtnf-c.) (pj 0.05). tnf-a stimulated id
expressions of five mediators (il6, il10, ifny, ptgs2, and ccl2), and aq and 4- fe
aaqb inhibited il6 elevation (pj 0.05). both components inhibited aromatase

the luciferase assay demonstrated that both components exhibited inhibitory effect on
ne-«b signaling and wnt/8-catenin signaling in the condition without tnf-a 4k the
stimulation. in conclusion, our results displayed an overall pattern that aq and 4- yay american
aaqb possess potential anti-inflammatory and antitumorigenic functions in mcf-7 é onmall
breast cancer cells and warranted further in vivo pre-clinical and clinical studies to of
explore their anticancer properties. 4 os ;
