analyses were performed as follows: the samples were first activated at 50°

 

for 2 min, then 95 °c for 2 min. then denaturing occurred at 95 °c for 30s
followed by annealing at 57 °c; the denature/anneal process was repeated over
40 cycles. relative gene expression was determined by comparing the c,value
of the gene of interest to that of the b-actin housekeeping gene, by the 244c
method. °8 three biological replicates were performed for each control group

and three technical replicates were used for each biological replicate.

raw 264.7 cells, hela and mcf7 cell lines were purchased from american type
culture collection (atcc, manassas, va). primary bone marrow derived
macrophages (bmdms) were isolated from freshly euthanized c57/b6 mice,
donated generously by dr jessie mager, department of veterinary and animal

unknown identification

the identity of unknown samples was predicted by computing the mahalanobis
distance of the unknown data to the training groups using lda. °° first, the
normalized fluorescence responses of the unknown samples were converted to
canonical scores in lda, using the discriminant functions established from the
reference set. next, mahalanobis distance of that case to the centroid of each
training cluster in the lda space was computed. 5°57 the unknown sample was
predicted to belong to the closest group, defined by the shortest mahalanobis
distance.
linear discriminant analysis (lda)

lda was applied on normalized fluorescence data to statistically classify each
group, using systat software (version 11.0, systatsoftware, richmond, ca,
u.s.a). all variables were used in the complete mode and the tolerance was set
as 0.001. input data was transformed to canonical scores to best separate each
group where the between-class variance was maximized while the within-class
variance was minimized. after transformation, lda reduces the dimensionality
of the. the 2d plot pictorially shows where each data point lies in the new
dimensional space. therefore, the positive and negative values on the axis do

not have any physiologically meaning.

conclusions

in summary, we demonstrate the use of a simple and robust chemical system
that can quickly capture the overall responses of activated macrophages in a
high-throughput format, which is challenging with biomolecular tools. through
the supramolecular assembly of only two elements, a 5-channel output is
achieved. the high level of information density enables us to accurately profile
a spectrum of activation state of macrophages. the ability to use chemical

macrophage polarization is a complex and dynamic process. with its roles in
homeostasis and disease, it is important to be able to discern macrophages
characteristics in a rapid and straight-forward manner. compared with current
methods of characterizing macrophage polarization, the sensor reported in this

chemical readout regarding the cell surface in a high-throughput matter.
standard methods, such as rt-pcr and elisa, can only capture a limited
number of well-established markers for each cell activation state, and are
independent (not multiplexed) assays, requiring a separate analysis for each.
considering the heterogeneity of macrophage polarization and the overlapping
nature of m1 and m2 markers, !!:!2 it is also difficult to elucidate and
differentiate activation states with standard methods. for instance, the
multiple il-10 markers used in our rt-pcr studies did not reveal significant
changes. the ambiguity of a less-well characterized sub-phenotype could be
because the end-point evaluation missed the dynamic changes on the
macrophage marker expression during the 48 h activation.

in contrast, the array-based sensor utilizes selective interactions between
sensor elements and the entire analyte surface to generate high-content
fingerprints for each activation state. once trained, the sensor can rapidly
identify target analytes through pattern recognition. although the c3-gu-py

the above studies demonstrate that our sensor array was able to discriminate
macrophages polarized with specific cytokines. however, biological
microenvironments are often far more complex and have multiple stimuli.
hence, we assessed whether the sensor could discern macrophage phenotype
in a model disease environment to address this issue. first, conditioned media
was generated by culturing different types of cancer cells (hela, cervical
carcinoma, and mcf7, mammary carcinoma) until ~80% confluency was
reached. then, the culture media was extracted and used to stimulate

macrophages for 48 h. rt-pcr results revealed different activation patterns for

each of the conditioned media types. an lda plot showed three well-separated
clusters with 100% classification accuracy (fig. 5, tables s7 and $8+). when
macrophages were exposed to cultured media conditioned by cervical cancer

versus breast cancer cells, the sensing readout was dramatically different,
indicating that a unique state of activation was present following each type of

that this method not only functions following single cytokine stimulation, but
also in more complex environments. this is promising evidence that with

when the sensor complex interacts with cells, in most cases, all monitored

 

fluorescence channels showed an increase in signal

 

ensity. this suggests
that upon interacting with macrophages, the sensor complex disaggregates,
exposing its individual components to interact with the cell surface. depending
upon the local environment, the fluorescence intensities for individual
molecules (pyrene, gfp, and fret) also change. since distinct fluorescence
patterns were consistently observed for each stimulus, we believe this
disruption process is modulated by cell surface functionalities and
composition. our previous studies have indicated that the sensor complex is
highly sensitive to glycosylation patterns on cell surfaces. °° however, more
mechanistic studies are needed in order to elucidate which other cell

components are also interacting with the sensor elements.

from c57/b6 mice and induced to differentiate into macrophages using
previously reported procedures. 43 once macrophage cells were obtained, we
exposed them to m1 and m2 subtype polarization stimuli for 48 h as used above
for raw 264.7 cells. rt-pcr results confirmed appropriate activations in each

the reliability of the sensor by performing unknown sample identification and

the size and complexity of the training set if needed. next, we investigated the
necessity of having 5 channels of information from the sensor by comparing

we first tested the ability of the sensor system to distinguish among,
macrophage phenotypes using the raw 264.7 macrophage cell line.
established cytokines were used to stimulate the cells, with each activating
macrophage through a different mechanism (table 1), generating a distinct
phenotypic state. rt-pcr results assessing standard m1 and m2 markers
confirmed that cells were polarized into corresponding states after 48 h
activation (fig.2). lps and ifn-y treated cells (m1 stimulation) showed
significant increases in tnf-a. and inos mrna expression whereas the il-4 (m2a
stimulation) group had an increase in egr2 and mannose receptor (mr)
expression. similar tnf-a levels observed between the combination treatment
and the control group could be explained by the prolonged 48 h activation
activation (fig.2). lps and ifn-y treated cells (m1 stimulation) showed
significant increases in tnf-a. and inos mrna expression whereas the il-4 (m2a

and the control group could be explained by the prolonged 48 h activation
time, negative regulators such as nfkb and nuclear factor activated t

cells, 35:36 greater production of nitric oxide, and the fast intracellular turnover
rate of tnf-a. 37 although the il-10 group (m2c stimulation) was tested against
multiple m2 markers, including egr2, mr, and tgf-b, as well as the reduction
of m1 marker inos, no significant changes in the levels of expression of any

associated genes were observed (fig. s7+).
supramolecular assembly of sensor

the sensor is designed to provide an information-rich, five-channel output with
only two sensor elements. the first element of the sensor is a cationic
poly(oxanorbornene) (poni) random copolymer scaffold that incorporates a
guanidine group and a pyrene dye molecule (c,-gu-py). the positively charged
guanidine group ensures that selective interactions occur only when the
complex is close to negatively charged cell surface functionalities. the
solvatochromic pyrene molecule will alter its spectral properties when local
environmental factors, such as polarity and hydrophobicity, change. * in this
way, both selectivity and sensitivity of the sensor are ensured. through
electrostatic interactions, cationic €,-gu-py forms a polymeric complex with
an anionic gfp. in practice, the pyrene unit provides three signalss, two
corresponding to the free pyrene and one to the excimer form. the gfp then

corresponding to the free pyrene and one to the excimer form. the gfp then
adds two channels: free gfp fluorescence and fret with the excimer pyrene
channel (fig. 1b).

initial studies focused on the optical characterization of the c,-gu-py/gfp
supramolecular assembly. polymer €,-gu-py was titrated with increasing
concentrations of gfp. after 30 min of incubation, a simultaneous decrease in
pyrene emission at 470 nm and increase of gfp emission at 510 nm was
observed upon irradiation with 344 nm light (fig. $1 and s2a‘). efficient
fluorescence quenching of c,-gu-py was observed at higher concentrations of
assembly (fig. s2b +). the association constant k, of 7.17 x 10° m+ was
derived by fitting the fluorescent titration curve.

the overall spectrum featured five distinguished output peaks that can be
recorded from the sensor: pyrene monomers at 344/390 and 344/420, pyrene
excimer at 344/470, gfp at 475/510, and fret signal at 344/510. based on the

given the significance and complexity of the roles macrophages play in biology

selecting therapeutic approaches. for example, manipulation of tumor-

efforts to generate therapies based on macrophage phenotypic conversion

challenging due to the complexity of the polarization process. an increasing

this sensor is applied to macrophages in different polarization/sub-polarization
states, it yields fluorescent signals in five channels. the multidimensional
output is then quantitatively analyzed using linear discriminant analysis (lda)
to reproducibly classify different macrophage activation states (fig. 1). to the

best of our knowledge, this combination of sensor elements resulting in a 5-

 

channel output has not been reported previously. we validated the sensor with
model macrophage raw 264.7 cells and primary bone marrow-derived
macrophages (bmdms) stimulated with known m1 and m2 polarizing cytokines.

channel output has not been reported previously. we validated the sensor with
model macrophage raw 264.7 cells and primary bone marrow-derived
macrophages (bmdms) stimulated with known m1 and m2 polarizing cytokines.
the successful discrimination of m1 and m2 macrophages among the five
subtypes demonstrates the ability of the sensor to accurately differentiate
subtle phenotypic changes. we further evaluated the efficacy of the sensor
system in a model disease environment, where macrophages were cultured in
cancer cell-conditioned media, generating distinct patterns for macrophages
exposed to different cancer types. taken together, the sensor platform can
classify macrophage phenotypes in a matter of minutes. furthermore, this,
platform can read out the effects of subtle environmental changes on
macrophages, providing a new tool for diagnostics and for fundamental studies
of macrophage behavior. the information generated can provide valuable
insights on macrophages in diseases, potentially improving efficiency of

existing therapies and facilitating the development of new treatments.

macrophage evaluations in standard cell lines and primary cells after cytokine

treatment, as well as following exposure to a model disease environment.
macrophages are plastic cells of the innate immune system that perform a wide
range of immune- and homeostasis-related functions. due to their plasticity,
macrophages can polarize into a spectrum of activated phenotypes. rapid
identification of macrophage polarization states provides valuable information
for drug discovery, toxicological screening, and immunotherapy evaluation.
the complexity associated with macrophage activation limits the ability of
current biomarker-based methods to rapidly identify unique activation states.
in this study, we demonstrate the ability of a 2-element sensor array that
provides an information-rich 5-channel output to successfully determine

macrophage polarization phenotypes in a matter of minutes. the simple and

   

robust sensor generates a high dimensional data array which enables accurate
macrophage evaluations in standard cell lines and primary cells after cytokine

treatment, as well as following exposure to a model disease environment.
