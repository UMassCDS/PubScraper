conclusions

in this study, we have developed a dna-based nanoprobe to quantify, at the
molecular level, e-cadherin-mediated tensile forces at cell-cell junctions. the
so-called dnameter exhibits several unique features. first, the intrinsic
modularity and precise self-assembly of the dna scaffold allows the accurate
positioning of specific number of reference fluorophores, reporter fluorophores
and quenchers. 2257-59 as a result, a facile ratiometric quantification of tensile
forces can be achieved. predictably, through the rational tuning of the
sequence and length of the dna hairpin, the threshold force can be tailored ina
large range to study different intensities of intercellular forces. 233 by further
conjugating two hairpins into one self-assembled “rod”-like dna structure, a
large range of tensile forces can be measured simultaneously. compared to two
separated membrane dna hairpin probes, the conjugated dnameter allows the
use of one reference fluorophore to characterize the membrane distributions of
both hairpins. supposedly, more hairpins can be incorporated into the

dnameter to realize delicate quantification of an even larger range of forces.

compared to the traction force microscopy, 2224 the beauty of the dnameter
is its capability to distinguish tension mediated by a particular protein from the
total forces at cell-cell junctions. compatible with readily accessible
fluorescence microscopes, the dnameter is also easy to prepare and use. by
simply incubating with the target cells, the dnameter can be spontaneously
anchored onto cell membrane to report the tensions. compared to fluorescent
protein-based sensors and cantilever pillars, 1.25 there is no requirement for
the cloning or microfabrication. in addition, the obtained fluorescence signals
can be straightforwardly converted into mechanical forces without the need of
complicated data processing or analysis. as a natural component in the cell
plasma membrane, the cholesterol anchors can freely diffuse along the
membrane. *° in addition, the cholesterol-dna conjugates can also be
effectively removed if desired (fig. $13 and s14+)..

we have demonstrated in detail two approaches to quantify the force
distributions by either the number of bright pixels or the unfolded dna probes.

addition, the ec-dnameter has been used to quantify intercellular e-cadherin
tension during the collective migration of cell sheet. in principle, the dnameter
can also be used to quantify three-dimensional protein-specific intercellular
forces in physiologically relevant multi-layer cell assemblies or tissues. 9°!
our study demonstrated the ability of the dnameter to quantify and real-time
monitor mechanical forces within a colony of cells. with a broad choice of
fluorophores and quenchers, the dnameter can be further used to
simultaneously measure intercellular forces among different receptor-ligand
pairs, and to study the correlations between forces and the concentration
gradients of morphogens or signaling molecules. © further applications of the
dnameter will allow the construction of more accurate mechanical models to
study mechanotransduction during embryogenesis, morphogenesis, and

various physiological and pathological processes.

force mapping during collective cell migration

cooperative intercellular forces drive cellular motions and play vital roles in
collective cell migration. 22.55 we asked if the dnameter could be used to
quantify intercellular tensions during collective migration of an epithelial
monolayer. epithelial migration occurs on a time scale of hours-to-days. we
first wondered if the dnameter allows long-term force measurement. for the
sake of simplicity, we prepared a non-quenched ec-dnameter containing only a
22%gc dna hairpin (nqec22-dnameter). after incubating this nqec22-
dnameter with a confluent mdck cell monolayer for 1 h, the probe persistence
on the cell membrane was studied. our results indicated that in a complete
growth medium, the cell membrane fluorescence would completely disappear
within 3 h (fig. $12). since the growth medium is needed for collective
epithelial migrations, the dnameter cannot be directly used for the force

mapping.
on the cell membrane was studied. our results indicated that in a complete

growth medium, the cell membrane fluorescence would completely disappear
within 3 h (fig. s12). since the growth medium is needed for collective
epithelial migrations, the dnameter cannot be directly used for the force
mapping.

to achieve a long-term force measurement, we asked if the cell membrane
probe density could be recovered by simply adding fresh dnameter. to test
that, we first anchored 0.2 um nqec22-dnameter onto mdck cell membrane in
hepes- buffered saline, followed by replacing with complete growth medium.
after 3 h incubation, almost no fluorescence was observed on the cell
membrane. by further replacing the growth medium with buffer containing 0.2
hm of fresh nqec22-dnameter, again, strong fluorescence and a similar level of
membrane probe density (95.6 4.5%) was observed at cell-cell junctions (fig.
$137). moreover, this loss-and-regain of cell membrane probes can be
repeated for at least 5 cycles without significant reduction in the efficiency (fig.
$13 and $147). in addition, considering the relatively weak e-cadherin binding
affinity, “5 intercellular e-cadherin interactions are highly dynamic. newly
added ec-dnameter probes can quickly engage in these natural cadherin
interactions. as a result, the dnameter can now be used to study long-term
cellular events.

finally, we applied the ec22-dnameter to measure intercellular e-cadherin

added ec-dnameter probes can quickly engage in these natural cadherin
interactions. as a result, the dnameter can now be used to study long-term
cellular events.

finally, we applied the ec22-dnameter to measure intercellular e-cadherin
tensions during collective epithelial migrations. a slab of polydimethylsiloxane
(pdms) was pre-attached onto a substrate, and then a confluent mdck cell
monolayer was formed adjacent to the pdms slab. 2” the interface between
the monolayer and pdms was defined as the initial edge. after the removal of
the pdms slab, the exposed free space triggers the migration of the cell sheet,
emulating the wound healing process. after the initial force mapping with the
ec22-dnameter, we replaced the hepes-buffered saline with the complete cell
growth medium. following another 12h of cell growth and migration, fresh
ec22-dnameter was added to measure intercellular e-cadherin tensions (fig,
5a and $151). before removing the pdms slab, intercellular forces mediated by

the cell sheet to migrate for 12 h, interestingly, junctional pixels of high g/y

e-cadherin were rarely observed within the cell sheet (ei

 

ratio were clearly observed in the regions ~15 cell lengths from the leading

 

edge of migration (fig. 5). we have further quantified the correlation between
the number of pixels experiencing >4.4 pn forces and their distance to the
leading edge (fig. s16+ and 5c, materials and methods). as the distance

increased, the percentage of e-cadherins undergoing intercellular tensions also
ratio were clearly observed in the regions ~ 19 cell lengths trom the leaaing

edge of migration (fig. 5). we have further quantified the correlation between
the number of pixels experiencing >4.4 pn forces and their distance to the
leading edge (fig. s16+ and 5c, materials and methods). as the distance
increased, the percentage of e-cadherins undergoing intercellular tensions also
linearly increased. in comparison, negligible forces were observed throughout
the imaging zone before removing the pdms (fig. 5c). overall, these
‘observations are in good agreement with some previous studies on the global

force distributions during this process. 1737.56
we next asked if the ec-dnameter could be used to monitor the dynamic
variations of e-cadherin-mediated intercellular tension after the egta
treatment. indeed, at a representative cell-cell junction, within 20 min after

prog-dnameter (~1.1%) was shown before and after adding egta (fig. 4d, $8,

as another validation, we applied the ec-dnameter to monitor the ml-7-
induced changes in the e-cadherin tension. ml-7 can inhibit the activity of
myosin light chain kinase and impair the ability of cells to concentrate e-
cadherin at cell-cell junctions. °4 as expected, the treatment of ml-7 induced a
gradual decrease in the g/y and r/y ratio at mdck cell-cell junctions (fig.
$10+). for example, at a representative junction, after adding 100 um ml-7, the
percentage of large tension (>8.1 pn) gradually decreased within 20 min from
6.3% to 0.5%, and meanwhile medium tension (4.4-8.1 pn) dropped from
10.2% to 0.5% (fig. $10). the statistical analysis of more cell-cell junctions
further confirmed this observation (fig. $11). in contrast, the control probe,

dynamics of e-cadherin-mediated tension

to validate if the ec-dnameter indeed measured e-cadherin-mediated tensile
forces, we have further studied the effect of ethylene glycol-bis (b-aminoethyl
ether)-n,n,n,n tetraacetic acid (egta) treatment on mdck cell adhesions. e-

ec-dnameter onto mdck cell membranes, the addition of egta triggered a
rapid and substantial loss of the fluorescence signal, accompanied with cell

dissociations (fig. 4a and s7+).

 
we next asked if we could quantify the distribution of different magnitudes of
tensile forces at cell-cell junctions. here, we quantified the force distribution by
either the number of bright pixels or the number of unfolded dna probes. to
calculate the number or percentage of pixels considering as g+ or r+, we first,
measured the membrane statistical fluorescence distribution of the negative
control, the prog-dnameter (fig. 2e). a threshold value of g/y> 1.0 and r/y >
0.24 was determined to distinguish the pixels experiencing tensile forces above
4.4 pn and 8.1 pn, respectively. after counting the total number of probe-
immobilized pixels (¥#) at cell-cell junctions, we quantified the percentage of
junction pixels experiencing the tensile forces (fig. 3b). for example, at a
representative cell-cell junction (fig. 3a), the weak (<4.4 pn), medium (4.4-8.1
pn), and strong (8.1 pn) tension was present in ~60.4%, 30.0%, and 9.6%
membrane areas, respectively. we have further calculated these distributions
at another 20 cell-cell junctions. on average, under the studied condition when
mdck cells were stably adhered to each other, the fraction of pixels

experiencing the weak, medium, and strong tension was 58.5 # 12.3%, 27.1
pn), and strong (*8.1 pn) tension was present in ~60.4%, 30.0%, and 9.6%

membrane areas, respectively. we have further calculated these distributions
at another 20 cell-cell junctions. on average, under the studied condition when
mdck cells were stably adhered to each other, the fraction of pixels
experiencing the weak, medium, and strong tension was 58.5 # 12.3%, 27.1
11.5% and 14.4 + 4.2%, respectively (fig. 3d and table $3).

  

the second approach to quantify the force distributions is based on the
number and percentage of the unfolded ec-dnameter. as mentioned above,
the percentage of unfolded 22%gc and 66%gc dna hairpin in each pixel can be
calculated by measuring the g/y and r/v ratio (fig. 2g). the number of
unfolded probes can then be quantified based on the tamra fluorescence and
the standard calibration curve (fig. 2f). our data indicated that 13.2 + 3.1% and
6.4 # 2.4% ec-dnameter probe was unfolded by 4.4-8.1 pn and >8.1 pn tension,
respectively, while 80.4 + 3.9% probe remained folded (fig. 3b and c, materials
and methods). as a control, unfolding of the prog-dnameter was negligible
(fig. 3e and g).

when comparing the obtained data from two approaches, we found that by
measuring the percentage of unfolded dna probes, force distributions at
different cell-cell junctions were more homogeneous (fig. 3d and f)..

distributions by measuring the percentage of unfolded probes rather than that
of bright pixels. even though the percentage of bright pixels is easier to be
quantified, the accuracy of this approach is influenced by the choice of
threshold values, e.g., g/y > 1.0 and r/y > 0.24 in this case. meanwhile, even in
pixels that are brighter than the threshold value, many dnameters can be still
in the folded form. in contrast, the percentage of unfolded dna hairpins can
more accurately report, at the molecular level, the force distributions

experienced by the dnameter.

imaging and quantification of e-cadherin-mediated tensile
forces

before imaging intercellular forces, we wondered if the addition of dnameter
would impair the adhesion and mechanical function of cell-cell junctions. we
first studied the effect of membrane-anchored ec-dnameter on the force-
dependent recruitment of vinculin and b-catenin to the adherens
junctions. 4748 immunofluorescence staining was used to image the cellular
locations of vinculin or b-catenin in mdck cells before and after adding the
dnameter. mdck cells have been widely used as a model cell line to study e-
cadherin-mediated tensile forces. “? no significant difference in the junction
vinculin or b-catenin fluorescence was observed (fig. $61). we have also used
western blot to study the effect of dnameter on the membrane expression of,
another critical cell-cell adhesion protein, b-catenin.°°>! again, the amount of
b-catenin in mdck cell membranes was quite similar in the presence or
absence of ec-dnameter anchoring (fig. s61). as a result, the addition of
dnameter will not influence the mechanotransduction at cell-cell junctions.
we also studied the effect of dnameter on the cell viability. for this purpose,
propidium iodide staining was conducted to assess the viability of mdck cells
with or without ec-dnameter probe treatment (fig. $6). minimal cell death

was observed in both cases. these results indicated that the modification of
dnameter will not influence the mechanotransduction at cell-cell junctions.

we also studied the effect of dnameter on the cell viability. for this purpose,
propidium iodide staining was conducted to assess the viability of mdck cells
with or without ec-dnameter probe treatment (fig. s6*). minimal cell death
was observed in both cases. these results indicated that the modification of
the dnameter probe or lipid-dna conjugate would not affect mdck cell
viability.

 

we next applied the ec-dnameter to image e-cadherin-mediated
intercellular tensile forces at mdck cell-cell junctions. after incubating the pre-
assembled ec-dnameter with mdck cells for 1 h, the cell membrane
fluorescence signal of fam (apy/ asm? 488/530 nm), tamra (ox/aem? 561/590
nm), and cy5 (ag,/aem: 640/675 nm) were imaged with a spinning disk confocal
microscope (fig. 3a). here, we denoted the fluorescence of fam, tamra, and
cysas 6, y, and r, respectively. for a given dnameter-modified cell membrane
(+), the weak (<4.4 pn), medium (4.4-8.1 pn), and strong (>8.1 pn) e-cadherin-
mediated intercellular tensile forces can be visualized based on the
fluorescence distribution of g-/r-, g+/r-, and g+/r+, respectively. a large
number of g+/r- and some g+/r+ pixels were clearly observed at mdck cell-
cell junctions (fig, 3a). to test if the fluorescence activation is indeed mediated
by e-cadherin interactions, we prepared a control dnameter without the

modification of e-cadherin, denoted as prog-dnameter. as expected, limited

by e-cadherin interactions, we prepared a control dnameter without the
modification of e-cadherin, denoted as prog-dnameter. as expected, limited
fam and cys fluorescence was observed, while the tamra fluorescence was
similar as that of the ec-dnameter. these results indicated that we could

visualize e-cadherin-mediated tensile forces using the ec-dnameter.
calibration of the dnameter on supported lipid monolayers

we next asked if we could further quantify the percentage of unfolded dna
hairpins based on the fluorescence intensities. for this purpose, we prepared a
supported lipid monolayer system using soybean polar extract. “° cholesterol-
modified dnameter can anchor into this monolayer and diffuse freely.2° by
mixing the soybean polar extract with different amount of dna probes, we can
precisely control the membrane density of the dnameter on lipid monolayers.
after preparing a series of monolayers with different probe densities, we
measured the corresponding membrane fluorescence intensity with a spinning
disk confocal fluorescence microscope. the same setup and parameters of the
microscope was used for the following cellular measurements as well.

the obtained fluorescence intensities were then plotted as a function of
probe densities for the calibration. a linear correlation between the

fluorescence intensity and the dnameter concentration was observed for all

 

ei tra lrp chire nm rtnsom ut pn mar ue an
microscope was used for the following cellular measurements as well.

the obtained fluorescence intensities were then plotted as a function of
probe densities for the calibration. a linear correlation between the
fluorescence intensity and the dnameter concentration was observed for all
the fluorophores, including fam (6), cy5 (r), and tamra (y) (fig. 2d and e).
similarly, a linear correlation was observed with all these fluorophores in the
‘dqdnameter as well (fig. 2d and e). after subtracting the background
fluorescence for each channel, the fluorescence intensity ratio of both
fam/tamra (g/y) and cy5/tamra (r/¥) is independent on the probe
concentration due to the linear correlation between the probe density and
fluorescence (fig. 2d). such concentration-independent g/y and r/y ratio was
observed with both the dnameter and dqdnameter, while the dqdnameter
exhibited a 4.0-fold and 8.3-fold higher intensity ratio. the g/y and r/v ratio can
thus be used to quantify the membrane dqdnameter-to-dnameter probe
density ratio, as well as the percentage of unfolded 22%6gc and 66%gc dna
hairpins, respectively.

‘our next goal is to validate if the g/y and r/y ratio can be used to quantify the
percentage of unfolded dna hairpins. we prepared mixtures of dqdnameter
and dnameter, with a ratio of 0: 1, 0.5:0.5, and 1:0. indeed, both g/y and r/y
ratio are linearly correlated with the percentage of the unfolded dqdnameter

(eig. 2e). we have also tested if the g/y and r/y ratio can orthogonally report

(eig. 2e). we have also tested if the g/y and r/y ratio can orthogonally report
the unfolding of 22%gc and 66%gc dna hairpins, respectively. by adding only
a complementary dna strand to either 22%gc or 66%6gc dna hairpin, we
prepared de-quenched dnameter with only one hairpin being unfolded. after
mixing different ratios of these two partially unfolded dnameter, indeed, the
fam and cys signal can be used to quantify the amount of unfolded 22%gc or
66%gc dna hairpin, without interfering with each other (fig. 2f). all these
results indicated that we could quantify the unfolding of dna hairpins in the
dnameter by measuring the g/y and r/y ratio. based on the standard

calibration curve (fig. 2d), we can also use the tamra fluorescence to quantify

 

the number of probes per individual pixel of images. as a result, we can
quantitatively determine not only the percentage, but also the number of

unfolded dna hairpins from the images (fig. 2g).

design and characterization of the dnameter

the dnameter is designed based on the self-assembly of four oligonucleotide
strands (fig. 1b and table s1+). two of the strands contain a 25-nucleotide-
long dna hairpin with 22% and 66% g/c base pairs to detect weak and strong
tensile force, respectively. as an internal reference, a tamra dye (agy/aem!
557/579 nm, denoted as y) was modified at one end of the 66%gc dna hairpin
strand. to detect the folding/unfolding switch of the 66%gc dna hairpin, a cys-
qsy®21 fluorophore-quencher pair (az,/aem: 640/659 nm, denoted as r-qg)
was conjugated next to the end of this hairpin. similarly, a fam-dabcyl
fluorophore-quencher pair (asy/acm: 488/519 nm, denoted as g-qg) was used

to measure the folding/unfolding of the 22%gc dna hairpin. after calculating
strand. 10 detect the rolaing/untolaing switch of the 66%l lna hairpin, a ly>-

qsy®21 fluorophore-quencher pair (az,/aem: 640/659 nm, denoted as r-qg)
was conjugated next to the end of this hairpin. similarly, a fam-dabcyl
fluorophore-quencher pair (asy/acm: 488/519 nm, denoted as g-qg) was used
to measure the folding/unfolding of the 22%gc dna hairpin. after calculating
the unfolding free energy of hairpin at zero force and the free energy of,
stretching the corresponding single stranded dna, 227° based on a worm-like
chain model, *°“° the tensile force threshold (f,/) of the 22%gc and 66%gc
dna hairpin was determined to be 4.4 pn and 8.1 pn, respectively (materials
and methods and table $2+). here, fi, is defined as the force at which the
dna hairpin has 50% probability of being unfolded.

when experiencing a weak tensile force (<4.4 pn), both fam-dabcyl and cy5-
qsy°21 pairs remain at close proximity, resulting in low fluorescence level in
both reporter channels (denoted as g-/r-). in contrast, a strong tensile force
(°8.1 pn\) results in the stretching out of both 22%gc and 66%gc hairpins. both
fluorophores will separate from the corresponding quencher, leading to an
increase in both fam and cy5 fluorescence signal (denoted as g+/r+). in
another case, a medium tensile force (4.4-8.1 pn) opens up the 22%gc hairpin,
but not the 66%gc hairpin, so only the fam signal will be activated (denoted as.
g+/r-). as a result, we can image different ranges of tensile forces based on the

two reporter channels.

but not the 66%gc hairpin, so only the fam signal will be activated (denoted as.
g+/r-). as a result, we can image different ranges of tensile forces based on the
two reporter channels.

to test the efficiency of this probe design, we prepared an e-cadherin-
modified dnameter (termed ec-dnameter) to quantify e-cadherin-mediated
intercellular tensile forces at the madin-darby canine kidney (mdck) epithelial
cell-cell junctions. e-cadherin is a transmembrane protein, which cytoplasmic
domain can bind with beta-catenin, alpha-catenin, and then experience forces
generated by the actomyosin cytoskeleton. 125 the ec-dnameter was
prepared using a protein g linker to couple the lgg/fc-fused extracellular
domain of e-cadherin with the dnameter (materials and methods). compared
with direct chemical conjugation, the protein g linker helps to avoid the loss of,
e-cadherin activities. 224! in addition, to allow the probe to insert onto mdck
cell membranes, a cholesterol anchor was conjugated at the other end of the
dnameter.

after demonstrating the formation of the dnameter in a gel mobility shift
assay (fig. $1), the cell membrane insertion efficiency of the dnameter was
studied. here, we prepared a non-quenched dnameter (nqdnameter) by using
dna strands that are not modified with dabcyl and qsy°21 quenchers (scheme

s1+). the fluorescence of the nqdnameter is always on and is independent of

dna strands that are not modified with dabcyl and qsy°21 quenchers (scheme
s1+). the fluorescence of the nqdnameter is always on and is independent of
intercellular forces. as a result, the cell membrane fluorescence intensity can
be used to indicate the concentration of the immobilized probes. indeed,
‘obvious fluorescence signal on mdck cell membranes was shown shortly after
adding these nqdnameter probes (fig. s2t).

we have further studied the membrane anchoring efficiency of the dnameter

 

containing one or two cholesterol tail. interestingly, one cholesterol-modified
nqdnameter (1chol-nqdnameter) exhibited higher insertion efficiency (2.1-
fold) on mdck cell membranes than the more hydrophobic two cholesterol-
modified one (2chol-nqdnameter) (fig. s2+). this might be due to the
relatively larger critical micelle concentration value of the 1chol-nqdnameter
as compared to 2chol-nqdnameter. “2 as a result, more monomeric
nqdnameter could exist in the solution when one cholesterol was anchored.
indeed, our recent data indicated that the cell membrane anchoring of the
lipid-dna conjugates stems mainly from the monomeric form, instead of the
aggregation form. *? previous studies have suggested that ~100 pn tensile

force is required to extract a cholesterol from lipid
membrane insertion of the cholesterol should be quite stable during the
unfolding of dna hairpins (4.4 pn and 8.1 pn). unless specifically indicated, one
cholesterol-based construct was used for the following studies.

we next asked if the dnameter probe may be activated by the cisreceptor-
ligand interactions on the same cell membrane, rather than between
neighboring cells. to study if the dna probes prefer to “stand” (favoring trans
interactions) or “lie down” (favoring cis interactions) on membrane surfaces,
we performed atomistic molecular dynamics simulation in a dnameter/lipid
bilayer membrane system (see materials and methods). our simulation results
indicated that the tilting angle (6) of the dnameter with respect to the
membrane surface is always within 30° (see fig. $3). indeed, these
membrane-anchored dna probes prefer to “stand” (8<30°) on the membrane
surface and favor the sensing of trans interactions between cells. the reason for
dna probes to maintain such orientation is likely attributed to the electrostatic
repulsion between dna strands and cell membranes, which are both negatively
charged. itis also worth mentioning that trans interactions between two e-

we next asked if we could distinguish the unfolding and the folding state of
dna hairpins based on their fluorescence intensities. to determine the
fluorescence of the unfolded dnameter, we prepared a de-quenched probe

intercellular mechanical forces, especially tensile forces, play important roles in
development, wound healing and cancer invasion. 1-3 these tensile forces at
cell-cell junctions actively reshape the tissues during morphogenesis in
embryos and in quiescent adult tissues, *~® such as epithelial and endothelial
monolayers. "8 for example, cadherins constitute a superfamily of cell-cell
adhesion molecules that are expressed in various types of cells. 21° it is known

sensing and transduction is therefore critical for revealing the fundamental

principles in the collective organizations and motions of cell populations. 819

 

however, mapping the spatiotemporal dynamics of intercellular forces is still

challenging, tools for the precise, quantitative, and real-time measurement of
tensile forces at cell-cell junctions are still largely missing. 2°-22

generally, two strategies are currently available to estimate intercellular
forces. monolayer stress microscopy utilizes cell-matrix traction force data to
deduce mechanical forces at cell-cell junctions, with the assumption that total
forces experienced by each cell remain zero.° traction force microscopy has
been used to elucidate the relationships between the total cellular forces on
extracellular matrix and the endogenous intercellular forces. 2“ however, these
methods can only be applied to a monolayer of cells. it requires extensive
image analysis and data processing. moreover, the force deduced is not specific

for certain junctional molecules. similarly, intercellular forces between a pair of

extracellular matrix and the endogenous intercellular forces. 2“ however, these
methods can only be applied to a monolayer of cells. it requires extensive

image analysis and data processing. moreover, the force deduced is not specific

 

for certain junctional molecules.

 

ilarly, intercellular forces between a pair of
cells have been measured by microfabricated cantilever pillars. 1? however, in

addition to the above-mentioned drawbacks, these cantilever

 

lars can only
measure forces between a pair of cells, one at a time, and require advanced
microfabrication facilities.

in another strategy, genetically encoded protein-based tension probes have
been developed to measure intercellular forces mediated by cadherins or
platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule. ®:2>-2" however, the routine use of
these sensors is limited due to their labor-intensive design and validation. the
functions of many junctional proteins will be disrupted after insertion of a large
protein sensor (~500 amino acids). the small force measurement range (1-12
pn) and low sensitivity of fluorescence signals of these probes (~10-fold lower
than sensors using common organic dyes) “8 further hinders the widespread
applications of these genetically encoded probes.

we have recently developed a new dna-based probe to visualize intercellular

tensile forces at cell-cell junctions. 2° in this system, a pair of cholesterol

‘once the intercellular tensile force exceeds the threshold value to unfold the
dna hairpin, the separation of a fluorophore-quencher pair results in the
activation of fluorescence signals. these dna probes are well suited for
intercellular force measurement. first, the probes function simply by
incubation with target cells. there is no need for cloning or transfection.
secondly, different mechanosensitive ligands or receptors can be directly
conjugated within these dna probes, which allow the facile study of specific
junctional molecule-mediated force transduction. thirdly, by tuning the
sequence and duplex length of the dna hairpin, the force tolerance of the
probe can be rationally adjusted in a large range. 22-24 moreover, a broad
choice of organic fluorophores and quenchers allows highly sensitive imaging
of tensile forces.

however, this “first-generation” dna tension probe has several limitations.
first, it cannot be used to quantify the intercellular forces due to the
heterogeneous membrane distribution of the probes. secondly, each dna
hairpin unfolds in a narrow threshold force range (+2 pn),2° itis challenging to

use a single probe to measure a large range of intercellular forces. in natural

a long-term measurement of intercellular forces. "3°38 however, current
lipid-modified dna probes havea limited anchoring persistence on the cell
membranes (~2 to 4 h). to overcome all these limitations, in this study we have
developed the “second-generation” dna-based membrane tension ratiometric
probe, termed “dnameter”.

the dnameter was designed to be highly adaptable, consisting of two self-
assembled dna hairpins with different threshold forces and a lipid tail to

anchor onto live cell membranes (

based on the fluorescence signal, an internal reference fluorophore was
introduced to normalize the membrane distribution of the dnameter. in
addition, two orthogonal fluorophore-quencher pairs were conjugated at the
end of each dna hairpin to report different magnitudes of forces. by measuring
each reporter-to-reference fluorescence intensity ratio, molecular scale
intercellular force distributions can be quantified at cell-cell junctions. using

self-assembled dna hairpins of different force tolerance. once the intercellular
tension exceeds the force tolerance to unfold a dna hairpin, a specific
