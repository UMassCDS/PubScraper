the cross-linked middle block is still intact, serving as a hydrophobic barrier for cv

in summary, a composite coassembly from amphiphilic diblock copolymer and
cross-linked inverse micelles, driven by hydrophobic interactions, has been
developed. the system concurrently captures the host-guest properties of both
polymeric micelles and inverse micelles. this nanoassembly exhibits (i) the capability
of encapsulating hydrophilic cargo in cross-linked inverse micelle core; (ii) concurrent
entrapment of hydrophobic cargo in the interfacial layer, assembled via hydrophobic
interactions; and (iii) sequentially addressable cargo release in response to specific
combinations of ph and reducing agent. we believe that the capability of
independently manipulating the host properties for different payloads can profoundly
impact the application of stimuli-responsive polymer assemblies for combinatorial
therapy and multistage delivery applications. overall, the concept of hydrophobic

physiochemical properties, especially hydrophilic and hydrophobic guests, into a
single polymeric nanoassembly is challenging, but would be profoundly beneficial
to combine with therapeutic delivery strategies. here, we report a nanocomposite
coassembled by coating a layer of an amphiphilic block copolymer onto the surface
of a cross-linked inverse micelle driven by hydrophobic interactions. the
hydrophobic coating layer and water-filled inverse micelles were utilized to
encapsulate hydrophobic and hydrophilic cargos, respectively. rationally
introducing the ph and redox responsive moieties into the coating polymer and
inverse micelles allows to sequentially address the triggered release of the
encapsulated cargos.

such as in combination therapy. (1-3) noncovalent sequestrati (1) tum off this notification
with similar solvophilic characteristics can be conveniently achieved. (4,5) however,
simultaneously loading a combination of hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules is
more challenging because of the opposing host microenvironment requirements in
such a system. (6,2) for example, hydrophobic cargos can be sequestered in water-
dispersible micelles, while hydrophilic cargos are encapsulated in the water-filled
lumen of inverse micelles in apolar solvents. (8-17) the contrasting nature of the
continuous phase in these two host assemblies highlights the challenges involved in
concurrent encapsulation of these two cargo types. the potential implications of
coencapsulating hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules in combination therapy have
driven research in this area. (18,19) such efforts have mostly focused on liposomes
or polymersomes, because of their water-filled lumen and the hydrophobic
membrane. (20-23) alternatively, lipid-coated hybrid nanoparticles are also
formulated through double emulsion methods to concurrently encapsulate and
release hydrophobic and hydrophilic cargos. in addition to coencapsulatio!
the release of the hydrophobic and the hydrophilic cargos are ir

driving force to achieve the targeted composite assembly. the simplicity and additive
nature of the assembly offer such a coassembly formation, which results in a
versatile strategy to achieve complex functional polymeric nanoassemblies. our goal
is to capture the essential host-guest properties from both micelles and inverse
micelles in a single assembly such that coencapsulation of hydrophilic and
hydrophobic cargos is feasible (scheme 1). we envisioned first the formation of an
inverse micelle (np1) using an amphiphilic triblock copolymer, where the inner and
outer blocks would be hydrophilic and hydrophobic, respectively. as the targeted final
assembly has conflicting solvophobic requirements, we envisaged stabilizing the
inverse micelle assembly through cross-linking of the middle block (np2). triblock
copolymer, p1, with a hydrophilic polymethacrylic block, hydrophobic
diisopropylamino-ethyl methacrylate (dipema) block, and the cross-linkable
pyridinyldisulfide-ethyl methacrylate (pdsema) block, satisfies these requirements.

independent triggerability to two different stimuli to release the hydrophobic and the
hydrophilic guest molecules. the hydrophobic interfacial layer of the assembly
constitutes the poly(dipema) block from both the diblock and the triblock
copolymers. a ph-induced protonation of the interfacial layer would trigger the
release of the diblock copolymer from the assembly while concurrently converting
the outer layer of the triblock copolymer assembly from a hydrophobic block to a
hydrophilic one (scheme 1b). the latter change causes the triblock copolymer
assembly to remain stable in the aqueous phase as a vesicle-type assembly (np4)
release of hydrophilic cargos can then be achieved in response to redox stimulus,
because un-cross-linking the middle block would destabilize the entire assembly, as
the triblock copolymer is now hydrophilic. overall, such a composite self-assembly

from the triblock copolymer p2. a water-soluble dye, calcein, was selected as a
model cargo to demonstrate the capability of encapsulating hydrophilic payload in
inverse micelles. the inverse micelle (np1) was prepared by sonicating a mixed
mixture of 5 mg of p2 in 2 ml of toluene and 2 ul of water containing calcein. then,
the resultant assembly was further stabilized by the addition of dithiothreitol (dtt),
which induces cross-links in the pyridyldisulfide block of the polymer, affording the
waist-cross-linked inverse micelles, np2. after filtering away the unencapsulated
calcein, the encapsulation of the dye was assessed using a uv-vis absorption
spectrum (figure s11). absorption at amax 507 nm indicates successful
sequestration of calcein in the inverse micelles. in a control, simple sonication of
toluene with the calcein solution, without p2, did not retain the dye in the solvent.
similarly, cross-linking of inverse micelles was evident from the absorption at amax

coassembles to form np3, the size of these particles was followed (figure 2). np3
exhibited a significantly increased size of ~60 nm, which differs from that of np2

was also supported by transmission electron microscopy (tem; figure s12).

the next question is whether hydrophobic coating of p2 onto np2 can be reversed at
lower ph. our hypothesis is that formation of np3 would be driven by hydrophobic
interaction between ph responsive dipema blocks from both p2 and np2
protonation of dipema blocks at lower ph, should then cause charge repulsion to
eliminate the hydrophobic interaction between protonated p2 and np2. as a result,
np3 should disintegrate and liberate protonated p2 and np2 (scheme 1). if this
reversal does occur, we should observe a drastic change in the size and zeta

process using an immiscible solvent combination, dcm and water. np3 was

by evaporation of dcm. we envisioned that the mechanism of self-assembly in this
method is similar to emulsification-solvent-evaporation procedure that is commonly
used in coating nanoparticles with lipids. (26) briefly, a dispersion of np2/dcm
solution droplets in water can be stabilized by the amphiphilic coating polymer to
form oil-in-water emulsion. removal of dcm can eventually deposit the coating
polymer to np2 or np2 aggregate surface through hydrophobic interaction to form
stable nanocomposite structures. size of np3 here was found to be ~70 nm (figure

observation of size decrease and the positive charge, when ph of solution was
