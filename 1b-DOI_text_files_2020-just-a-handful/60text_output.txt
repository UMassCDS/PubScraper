4. conclusion

to conclude, a new colorimetric ph-sensing indicator film
has been created for monitoring fish freshness that consists
of red barberry anthocyanins (rba) trapped within a
methylcellulose/chitin nanofiber (mc/cnf) matrix. our
results showed that the incorporation of the rbas within the
mc/cnfs composite film improved the physico-mechanical,
optical and barrier properties. moreover, the colorimetric ph-
sensing film provided significant antioxidant and
antimicrobial activity. spectroscopic analyses showed that
rbas had good compatibility with the composite film matrix.
visually observations also indicated that when the ph was
raised from 1 to 14 the color of the rba solutions shifted from
reddish/crimson to yellow. moreover, the anthocyanin-loaded
films showed similar color changes as the anthocyanin
solutions. the halochromic film developed in this study was
also shown to be applicable to monitor and track fish

films showed similar color changes as the anthocyanin
solutions. the halochromic film developed in this study was
also shown to be applicable to monitor and track fish
freshness during storage. in summary, our results suggest
that these natural pigments may be a good alternative to
synthetic dyes for the development of smart packaging
materials containing sensors/indicators capable of
monitoring the freshness and spoilage of food products in
real-time. specifically, they provide measurable alterations in
their optical properties in response to changes in their
quality. these smart packaging materials may lead to an
improvement in food quality and safety, as well as a
reduction in food waste, thereby improving the healthiness
and sustainability of the food supply.

3.7. fish freshness monitoring as a food model

finally, we examined the potential of the rba-loaded mc/cnf
films as in situ colorimetric indicators of food
freshness/spoilage using fish as an example. the spoilage of
seafood during storage is mainly a result of the action of
microorganisms and enzymes, which cause chemical changes
that lead to the formation of volatile nitrogen substances and
an increase in ph value. these volatile compounds include
ammonia and amines that result from the decomposition of
that lead to the formation of volatile nitrogen substances and
an increase in ph value. these volatile compounds include
ammonia and amines that result from the decomposition of
proteins. we therefore ascertained whether the rba-loaded
mccnf films could be used as smart indicators of the
freshness of fish when stored at room temperature for 72 h
(fig, 9). the ph values of the fish sample increased from 6.3
to ~8.0 during the test period (72 h). the resultant increase
in ph inside the films led to an observable color change, with
the films changing from reddish to pale pink. our results are
therefore consistent with those of other researchers who
have also reported that natural pigments can be used in
biopolymer films to monitor food safety and quality
(alizadeh-sani, tavassoli et al., 2020; huang et al., 2019; ka
et al., 2020).

3.6. dpph trial

as reported in table 1, the methylcellulose base film had no
antioxidant effect. in contrast, the mc/cnfs film exhibited a
small dpph radical scavenging activity (15.5 %), whereas the
rba-loaded films exhibited a strong radical scavenging
activity (82.1 %) (p< 0.05). this latter result can be ascribed to
the strong antioxidant activity of the o—h groups in the rba
avtbaouavins.indead. che pra sduginnnerhibivedgingificant
activity (82.1 %) (p< 0.05). this latter result can be ascribed to
the strong antioxidant activity of the o—h groups in the rba
anthocyanins. indeed, the rba solutions exhibited significant
antioxidant capacity when compared to bht standard
solutions (fig. 8). an increased antioxidant activity has also
been reported in earlier studies after the incorporation of
anthocyanins into packaging films (huang et al., 2019; wang
et al., 2019; yong, wang, bai et al., 2019). taken together,
these results suggest that anthocyanin extracts may be used
as natural antioxidants in biodegradable films.
3.4.3. moisture barrier test

the water vapor permeability (wvp) of the various films are
represented in table 1. as expected, a significant difference
was observed in wvp between the methylcellulose film and
the other samples (p < 0.05), with wvp values ranging from
around 6.50 to 2.35 x 10“! g/m. s. pa. in particular, the rba-
loaded mc/cnf films had a significantly lower wvp than the
methylcellulose films. this suggests that the phenolic
compounds and anthocyanins physically interacted with the
mc and cnfs and formed bridges between them, thereby
reducing the porosity of the biopolymer network (yong,
wang, zhang et al., 2019). our results show that the
permeability of all the films increased over time (aw/at),
especially the mc film. several researchers have described
that the wvp of bio-based packaging films decreased after
adding anthocyanins (alizadeh-sani, tavassoli et al., 2020;
especially the mc film. several researchers have described
that the wvp of bio-based packaging films decreased after
adding anthocyanins (alizadeh-sani, tavassoli et al., 2020;
wang et al., 2019).

3.4.4. water solubility

the water solubility (ws) values of the various films are
shown in table 1. our results show that the methylcellulose
film had the maximum water solubility (46.2 %). the
incorporation of cnfs led to a slight reduction in the water
solubility of the films (40.3 %), whereas the further addition
of the rba led to a slight increase (43.1 %) but still lower
than for the original mc-films (p < 0.05). the reasons for the
decreasing water solubility with the addition of barberry
extract can mainly be ascribed to the hydrophi
the anthocyanins and the formation of strong and compact
biopolymer networks (wang et al., 2019; zhang et al., 2019).
previous researchers have reported similar results when
anthocyanins were incorporated into biopolymer films
(huang et al., 2019; zhang et al., 2019).

3.5. bacterial inhibition

e.coli & s. aureus bacteria were used as model foodborne
pathogenic and spoilage organisms for evaluation of the
microbial inhibitory of the films (table 1). as anticipated, the
methylcellulose films did not demonstrate any antimicrobial
effect. however, the other films exhibited bacterial inhibitory
effects against the tested bacteria, which indicates that both
cnfs and rbas exhibit antimicrobial activity. the
antimicrobial activity against e. coli (18.3 mm) were more
pronounced than against s. aureus (16.8 mm) (p< 0.05). the
incorporation of rbas reinforced the inhibitory potency of
the films, which is typically attributed to the polyphenolic
structure of anthocyanins (zhang et al., 2019). although, the
mode of action of cnfs has not been specifically elucidated,
according to previous studies, it can be considered as a
bacteriostatic agent. in fact, cnfs have been shown to
promote bacteria cell flocculation and to inhibit bacteria
according to previous studies, it can be considered as a
bacteriostatic agent. in fact, cnfs have been shown to
promote bacteria cell flocculation and to inhibit bacteria
growth, which may be due to the molecular interactions
between chitin (positively charged) and cell membranes
(negatively charged). these interactions may induce bridging
flocculation and lead to membrane destruction and leakage
of intracellular material (shankar et al., 2015). other
researchers have also reported that adding anthocyanins to
packaging films improved their bacteriostatic/or bactericidal
effects (alizadeh-sani, tavassoli et al., 2020; zhang et al.,
2019).
3.4. physico-mechanical variables

3.4.1. mechanical characterizations

the mechanical indices of the various films were measured
(table 1), with the addition of cnfs to methylcellulose film,
the stiffness (em) and strength (ts) increased significantly
from 266 — 376 — 397 mpa, and from 45 — 47 61 mpa,
fesvectiyelv (p< 0.05). while the flexibilitv (eab) decreased,
the stiffness (em) and strength (ts) increased significantly
from 266 — 376 — 397 mpa, and from 45 — 47 61 mpa,
respectively (p < 0.05), while the flexibility (eab) decreased
(from 37. 12.7%) (p < 0.05). nevertheless, adding glycerol
improved the fragility of the composite films. the mechanical
indices are typically considered as important characteristics
for determining robustness of films in practical applications
(alizadeh-sani, tavassoli et al., 2020). the observed decrease
in flexibility and increase in rigidity and stiffness of the films
after adding cnfs suggested that the chitin nanofibers acted
as active filler materials within the mc matrix (de dicastillo,
rodriguez, guarda, & galotto, 2016; shankar et al., 2015).
conversely, with the incorporation of rbas, the flexibility of
the films increased (p< 0.05), which suggests that they may
have acted as a plasticizer that increased the mobility of the
polysaccharide chains (de dicastillo, bustos, guarda, &
galotto, 2016; ezati & rhim, 2020). this effect may have been
due to h-bond formation between the rbas and the
jopolymer matrix, as suggested by the ftir results discussed
earlier. the current findings indicated that the cnfs were a
strong filler material. which enhanced the mechanical
biopolymer matrix, as suggested by the ftir results discussed
earlier. the current findings indicated that the cnfs were a
strong filler material, which enhanced the mechanical
resistance of the composite films, whereas the rbas were
plasticizers that improved the flexibility and strength.
likewise, kang et al. (2020) described that the incorporation
of rose anthocyanins within polyvinyl alcohol/okra mucilage
films improved their mechanical strength (kang et al., 2020).

 

3.4.2. thickness

the thickness of films is of particular importance because it
affects their mechanical, optical, and physical characteristics
(yong, wang, zhang et al., 2019). in the current study, the
thickness of methylcellulose-based films ranged from 0.10 to
0.13 mm (table 1). the films thickness increased with the
addition of each of the additives, which may have been
because they contained more matter after dehydration.
milarly, many researchers have shown a slight increase in
film thickness after the addition of various anthocyanins and
extracts (ma et al., 2018; wang et al., 2019; zhang et al.,
ilarly, many researchers have shown a slight increase in
film thickness after the addition of various anthocyanins and
extracts (ma et al., 2018; wang et al., 2019; zhang et al.,
2019).

 

 

 
3.3.3. tga/dtg

the thermal degradation of the biocompatible films was
assessed by tga/dtg analysis (fig. 7). the tga and dtg
thermal profiles show the weight loss and the maximum
decomposition temperature during thermal degradation,
respectively. the tga test indicated that the films exhibited
similar thermal stability trends. in all cases, thermal
decomposition consisted of three distinct phases of weight
loss. the 1st phase appeared at a temperature between
100-200 °c owing to dehydration of adsorbed moisture and
decomposition consisted of three distinct phases of weight
loss. the 1st phase appeared at a temperature between
100-200 °c owing to dehydration of adsorbed moisture and
any remaining solvents. the 2nd phase appeared at a
temperature of around ~330-350 °c because of loss of the
glycerol molecules. the 3rd phase occurred around ~460 °c
because of the disintegration of the biopolymers and rbas.
the rba-loaded films were found to be the most thermally
stable, with the key thermal degradation events occurring at
higher temperatures than for the other films. the increased
thermal stability of the rba-loaded films may have been
because they contained anthocyanins and phenolic
compounds that are relatively heat stable. these findings
were consistent with previous studies using anthocyanins
and phenolics in various biopolymer matrices (ma et al.,
2018; wang et al., 2019).

ftir spectroscopy provides valuable knowledge about
molecular conformations and interactions between different
constituents within composite films. as shown in fig. 6,
ftir spectroscopy provides valuable knowledge about
molecular conformations and interactions between different
constituents within composite films. as shown in fig. 6,
istinct absorption bands that could be related to speci
functional groups were observed at: 3500-3200 cm“ (oh
and nh stretching); 2900-2800 cm——" (c-h stretching);
1100-1000 cm“! (co and cn stretching); 1750-1600 cm——
-1(co= stretching bands, amide | group); and, 1500 cm
(amide il group) (oun & rhim, 2017). all films had fairly
similar ir spectral patterns. the ftir spectra revealed that
the hydroxyl, amine, and amide groups in the structure of the
compounds played an important role in the creation of
hydrogen and covalent bands, as well as other molecular
interactions (huang et al., 2019; wu et al., 2019). with the
addition of cnfs into the methylcellulose film, a downstream
shifting in o—h and -nh stretching (~3397 — 3340 cm“), co
stretching (~1641 — 1634 cm="') and co— stretching
(~1044 -. 1014 cm") was observed, which revealed that
various new interactions occurred between the matrix
compounds. the amide-i band was also detected at ~1641
cm is a result of c=o stretching of the carbonyl group
various new interactions occurred between the matrix
compounds. the amide-i band was also detected at ~1641
cm is a result of c=o stretching of the carbonyl group
(yong, wang, zhang et al., 2019); in the rba-loaded films, the
bond intensity was intensified in the ~3368 cm“! (oh
stretching) and ~1717 cmn—"! (co= stretching) regions,
which could be due to o—h functional groups in the
anthocyanins and the formation of hydrogen bonds. in
addition, absorption peaks corresponding to a carbonyl (c=
0) group were observed around 1712 and 1717 cm“, which
were attributed to the presence of acetic acid, which was
used as a solvent to dissolve the chitin during film
preparation. the acidic carbonyl group did not appear in the
pure methylcellulose film or the cnf powder, since they had

absorption frequencies of functional groups containing a
carbonyl appear in the following regions: acidic (1700-1725

anhydride (1800-1830 & 1740-1775 cm"), ester (1735-1750

the rbas had good compatibility with the matrix of mc/cnfs
anhydride (1800-1830 & 1740-1775 cm"), ester (1735-1750
cm’), and ketone. thus, the atr-ftir analysis suggests that
the rbas had good compatibility with the matrix of mc/cnfs
and formed a homogeneous film through intermolecular
interactions between rbas (o—h groups) and mc/cnfs (o—
h and nh— groups) without alteration in other molecular
structures. the results described are accordance with
previous studies on carbohydrate materials (zhai et al., 2017;
zhang et al., 2019).

   

  
3.3.1. morphology assay

the microstructure and morphology of the various film
samples were measured by fe-sem (fig. 5). the
methylcellulose films had relatively smooth and uniform
surfaces, whereas the mc/cnf films had some smooth
regions and some rough regions, which suggests that the
chitin nanofibers may have formed localized aggregates
within the film matrix due to the insolubility of chitin. the
addition of rbas to the mc/cnf films did not lead to a
significant change in their morphology, suggesting that the
anthocyanins may have been evenly distributed throughout
them and causes the film network structure more compact.
other studies have also observed similar results after
incorporation of pigments into biopolymer films (kang et al.,

the rba-loaded films were exposed to ammonia vapor to
evaluate their colorimetric response to alkaline conditions
and volatile basic nitrogen components, which can be utilized
as an sensor/indicator of the spoilage of foods with high
protein contents (kang et al., 2020). the color shifts and
sensitivity of the halochromic film to ammonia vapor are
shown in fig. 4. as expected, the halochromi

shown in fig. 4. as expected, the halochromic indicator
exhibited pronounced color changes when exposed to
ammonia vapor, changing from pink/reddish initially to
yellow after 30 min exposure. the halochromic indicator's
sensitivity (sgcg) to ammonia vapor increased over time: sgcg
increased by around 13 % after 10 min, 40 % after 20 min, and
68 % after 30 min. the obvious color changes and high
sensitivity of the ph-sensing film to ammonia vapor were
owing to the presence of polyphenolic compounds in the
anthocyanin structure and also the structural transformations
of the rba molecules caused by the hydroxyl ions and
formation of oxygen anions (fig. 3a). ammonium ions (nh; )
induced by hydration and hydrolysis of ammonia vapor (nh3)
within the film matrix, created localized alkaline conditions
on the surfaces of the ph-sensing indicator (ezati & rhim,
2020). the real-time, instant and sensitive response of
colorimetric indicators is an important characteristic of smart
indicators in packaging materials. consequently, our findings
indicate that the designed smart ph-sensing indicator may be
suitable sensor because of their sensitivity to changes in ph
indicators in packaging materials. consequently, our findings

influences its suitable for specific food packaging
applications. visually, the methylcellulose films appeared
transparent and colorless while the mc/cnf films had a slight
yellow appearance. after incorporation of the rbas into the
mc/cnf matrix, the films had a reddish/crimson appearance
(fig. 2c), which can again be ascribed to selective light
absorption by the anthocyanins. the color indices of the films
are represented in table 1. the methylcellulose films had the
highest lightness. there was a rise in the b value (yellowness)
and reduction in the l value of these films after cnf was
added (p < 0.05), which can be attributed to selective
absorption and scattering effects associated with the chitin
nanofibers, the rba-loaded films had the lowest lightness
and hue-angle, but the highest chroma, redness (a), and
yellowness (b) values (p < 0.05). these phenomena can be
ascribed to the reddish/pale peach color of rba under mildly
acidic conditions, which has been related to the presence of
pelargonidin-3-glucoside (berenji ardestani, sahari, &
barzegar, 2016). other researchers have described similar
color shifts in films containing anthocyanins isolated from
plack,savbean-seed.coat extract (wane et.al, 2019).saffron
barzegar, 2016). other researchers have described similar
color shifts in films containing anthocyanins isolated from
black soybean seed coat extract (wang et al., 2019), saffron
petal anthocyanins (alizadeh-sani, tavassoli et al., 2020), and
red cabbage (liang et al., 2019)

3.2.4. ph-dependence of colorimetric indicator

the ph-sensitivity of the colorimetric indicator was also
measured by placing small samples of the rba-loaded films
into various buffer solutions (fig. 3). the ph-induced color
shifts of the rba-loaded films followed the same trend as
those of the rba solutions (fig. 1a). the rba-loaded mc/cnf
films underwent clearly observable color shifts after wetting
in the buffer solutions (ph = 2-14), which suggested their
potential as ph-sensing indicators in packaging materials.
the observed color changes as the ph was increased were as
follows: reddish/crimson under acidic conditions; pale peach
at near-neutral conditions; and, yellow under alkaline
conditions, similar results have been reported in films
containing red cabbage anthocyanin or rose extracts (kang et
at near-neutral conditions; and, yellow under alkaline
conditions, similar results have been reported in films
containing red cabbage anthocyanin or rose extracts (kang et

the transparency or opacity of a film is another important
optical attribute for many food packaging applications. the
highest transparency was observed for methylcellulose film
(table 1), which exhibited good light transmission from 200
to 800 nm (fig. 2). the incorporation of cnfs into the mc-
films reduced their transparency and uv light transmission,
which was mainly attributed to selective light scattering by
the nanofibers. the incorporation of rba into the mc/cnf
films further decreased their transparency and uv light
transmission, which was mainly attributed to selective light
absorption by the anthocyanins (ezati & rhim, 2020). other
researchers have recently shown that the transparency and
light transmission of films decreases after addition of natural
particles and chromophores (alizadeh-sani, tavassoli et al.,

the ability of films to screen uv-vis radiation is an important
attribute of packaging systems designed to preserve foods

consequently, the uv-vis light transmittance and absorbance
spectra of the samples were analyzed (fig. 2). the films
containing rbas exhibited strong uv light screening
properties, significantly reducing the light transmittance in
the uv region (~280 nm) compared to rba-free films (fig.
2c). this trait is associated with the capacity of anthocyanins
to strongly absorb uv light due to their unique functional
groups (wu et al., 2019; yong, wang, zhang et al., 2019). in
contrast, the pure methylcellulose (fig. 2a) and mc/cnf (fig.
2b) films exhibited higher transparency and greater light
transmittance in the visible area than the colorimetric film.
recent studies also reported a decrease in the uv-vis light
transmission after the addition of anthocyanins into
biopolymer films (alizadeh-sani, tavassoli et al., 2020; yong,
wang, zhang et al., 2019).

cu dl au cuiul plopel es ul rdas

solution
initially, the color and absorption spectra of rba solutions
were measured at various ph values (1-14) to establish the
potential application of rba as a natural halochromic
indicator (fig. 1a and b). both the colorimetric and uv-vis
spectroscopy data revealed that the color of rba solutions
was strongly ph-dependent. specifically, the color changed
from reddish/crimson (in acidic phs) to pale pink (in neutral
phs) to yellow (in alkali phs) as the ph was raised from 1 to
14. these color changes are due to alterations in the chemical
structure of the anthocyanins from flavylium cation (reddish)
in acidic conditions to carbinol pseudo-base (greyish) in
neutral conditions to chalcone in alkaline conditions
(yellowish) (zhang et al., 2019). moreover, the peaks observed
in the uv-vis spectra depended on ph. the maximum
absorbance peak in acidic conditions was observed around
500 nm, which was assigned to the flavylium cations. with
increasing ph, the maximum absorption peak reduced in
height and shifted to higher wavelengths, which corresponds
to the formation of the chalcone form of the anthocyanins
increasing ph, the maximum absorption peak reduced in
height and shifted to higher wavelengths, which corresponds
to the formation of the chalcone form of the anthocyanins
(alizadeh-sani, tavassoli et al., 2020; wu et al., 2019). these
results clearly demonstrate the high sensitivity of the rbas to
ph changes, which suggests that they should be suitable for
use an ph indicators in smart films.

potential as smart active biodegradable films by using them

1. introduction

films containing colorimetric indicators that are sensitive to
changes in ph and/or chemical composition are useful in the
development of smart packaging materials for fresh foods
(alizadeh-sani, mohammadian, & mcclements, 2020;
alizadeh-sani, mohammadian, rhim, & jafari, 2020).
consumers can then quickly distinguish between fresh and
spoiled food without opening the packaging, which may lead
to improves in food quality and reductions in food waste
(yam, takhistov, & miltz, 2005). the formulation of these
smart films from natural biodegradable polymers, such as
proteins and polysaccharides, has advantages over
petroleum-based films from an environmental perspective
(alizadeh-sani, mohammadian, rhim et al., 2020; ghani,
cozzolino, castelli, & farris, 2016). moreover, a smart
indicator embedded within the final packaging material can
be used to monitor and record food status throughout storage
cozzolino, castelli, & farris, 2016). moreover, a smart
indicator embedded within the final packaging material can
be used to monitor and record food status throughout storage
by coupling it with analytical sensors (ghaani et al., 2016;
mohammadian, alizadeh-sani, & jafari, 2020). in addition,
smart biodegradable films can be further engineered to
improve their functional performance by including
antimicrobials and/or antioxidants so as to protect a
packaged food from spoilage during storage (alizadeh-sani,
mohammadian, mcclements et al., 2020; bagheri et al., 2019).
accordingly, there is great potential in creating a new
generation of smart and active biodegradable films for food
applications, with the ultimate aim of increasing food safety,
quality, and sustainability.

there is therefore interest in identifying natural substances
that can be used as indicators, antimicrobials and/or
antioxidants withing biodegradable films. barberry (berberis
vulgaris l) is a well-known botanical source of water-soluble
anthocyanins, which can be used as natural colorimetric
indicators (mahdavi, jafari, assadpour, & ghorbani, 2016).
contac eptun avaminerlisenntantiol foe utilizatioainiuw
anthocyanins, which can be used as natural colorimetric
indicators (mahdavi, jafari, assadpour, & ghorbani, 2016).
consequently, we examined its potential for utilization in
smart and active polysaccharide-based films, which were
assembled from two abundant polysaccharide sources: chitin
and cellulose. in particular, we used chitin nanofibers (cnfs)
and methylcellulose (mc) to fabricate the films because these
polysaccharides have the ability to form biodegradable films
when used in combination, ie, the ability to form films with
appropriate barrier attributes and mechanical resistance
(liang, sun, cao, li, & wang, 2019; shankar, reddy, rhim, &
kim, 2015).

our hypothesis was that cnf/mc-based films containing red
barberry anthocyanins (rbas) could be used to both protect
and monitor food spoilage during storage. for this reason, we
characterized the visual, physico-mechanical, barrier, and
protective effects of the films, and then investigated their
potential as smart active biodegradable films by using them
to create a packaging material for a model food (fish).

abstract

a novel ph-sensitive colorimetric film was prepared based on
immobilizing red barberry anthocyanins (rbas) within
composite chitin nanofiber (cnf) and methylcellulose (mc)
matrices. the incorporation of cnfs and rbas improved their
mechanical properties, moisture resistance, and uv-vis
screening properties. moreover, the rbas could be used as
colorimetric indicators to detect food spoilage because they
are sensitive to changes in ph and ammonia gas production.
the rba-halochromic indicator changed from
reddish/crimson -. pink — yellow with increasing ph, and
from pink -. yellow with increasing ammonia vapor

reddish/crimson -. pink — yellow with increasing ph, and

from pink -. yellow with increasing ammonia vapor
concentration. furthermore, the smart films possessed good
antioxidant and antimicrobial activity owing to the presence
of the rbas and cnfs. finally, the validity of the indicator to
monitor the freshness/spoilage of a model food (fish) was
demonstrated. overall, this study shows that active/smart
films can be assembled from food grade ingredients that can
protect and monitor the freshness of products, like meat and
fish.
