recognition of novel and lexicalized

 

compound words during sentence reading.
‘the frequency of the head noun in modifier-
head compound words was manipulated to
tap into the degree of compositional
processing. this was done separately for long
(12-16 letter) and short (7-9 letters)
compound words. based on the dual-route
race model (pollatsek et al, 2000) and the
visual acuity principle (bertram & hyéna,
2003), long lexicalized and novel compound
words were predicted to be processed via the
decomposition route and short lexicalized
compound words via the holistic route. gaze
duration and selective regression-path
duration demonstrated a constituent
frequency effect of similar size for long
lexicalized and novel compound words. for
short compound words the constituent
frequency effect was negligible for
lexicalized words but robust for novel words.
‘the results are consistent with the visual
acuity principle that assumes long novel

compound words to be recognized via the
