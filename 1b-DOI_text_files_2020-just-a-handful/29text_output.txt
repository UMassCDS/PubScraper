modification strategies offer efficient and robust methods to obtain protein films
with a variety of functionalities. surface modifications enable the fabrication of
multifunctional films, while utilizing additives help overcome inherent limitations
of native protein films such as rigidity, mechanical instability etc. a major
imitation of both approaches is the cytotoxicity arising from the reagents utilized
for modifications or the resultant by-products. furthermore, often organic
solvents must be utilized for some modification strategies, which may result in
protein denaturation and loss of function.

 

3 applications of protein coatings

protein films are already widely used in biomedical and food packaging
applications. broadly, the applications of protein films may be categorized into
the following — tissue engineering and wound-repair scaffolds, antimicrobial
coatings, sensing and diagnostic devices, and food-packaging applications.

biocompatible, have modulable mechanical properties and show enzymatic

collagen is another protein that is extensively applied to tissue engineering and
wound-healing scaffolds, as it is the dominant protein in the extracellular matrix.
{871 various crosslinking, thermal treatment and additive-based strategies have
been utilized to enhance the mechanical and enzymatic stability of collagen films.

 

another avenue for the application of protein films is as antimicrobial coatings.
antimicrobial coatings prevent the bacterial contamination of medical devices
and consequent infections. antimicrobial protein coatings are designed by three
main strategies — anti-fouling coatings that prevent bacteria adhesion on the
surface; contact-killing wherein antimicrobial agent incorporated within protein
film kills bacteria adhered to the surface; controlled-release systems wherein the
protein film acts as a scaffold to load and release antimicrobial agents. properties
of the native proteins have been translated into the protein film to design anti-
fouling!22.©4l and antimicrobial (contact-killing) coatings.”5] grafting of

4 conclusions and perspectives

this review discusses strategies for the fabrication of stable protein films, and the
application of these biomaterials. proteins are naturally occurring functional
building blocks that are water-processible, making them ideal for designing
sustainable and biodegradable materials. furthermore, the choice of protein can
be used to dictate properties such as biocompatibility, cytophilicity, anti-fouling
and antimicrobial behavior, all of which are especially attractive for biomedical
applications. protein film stabilization strategies predominantly use one of the
three different strategies discussed in this review — 1) using self-assembling
structural proteins, 2) using chemical or physical crosslinking strategies, and 3)
using thermal treatment strategies. additionally, strategies employing post-
functional modifications and additives to enhance properties of protein films are
frequently utilized in combination with the above approaches.

thermal treatment offers additive-free approaches for fabricating water-stable
protein films. however, the high temperatures utilized in most thermal treatment
strategies can cause uncontrolled protein denaturation and consequently loss of
protein functionality/properties. these losses may be ized by utilizing the
nil strategy summarized above however, the application of nil is limited to flat,
two-dimensional substrates. fiuorous-curing offers an alternative approach to
the nil-treated protein films by demonstrating similar robustness to the nil
approach. additionally, pfhp-based fluorous curing has also shown to enhance
mechanical and enzymatic stability in addition to aqueous stability. however, this
pfhp-based thermal treatment approach is recent and its generalizability to
different types of proteins remains untested.

 

2.4 modification through surface functionalization or
incorporation of additives

modification strategies, either through surface functionalization or incorporation
of additives into protein films, offer new areas of film application by endowing
them with unique properties. surface modifications are often conducted to
increase either the hydrophilicity or hydrophobicity of protein films, impart
specific chemical functionality to the film surface, or enhance biological
properties such as cell adhesion. for instance, mussel-inspired dopamine

chemistry has been utilized for the surface modification of silk fibroin used to
fortify soy-protein adhesives.!4i silk fibroin films have also been treated with
ethanol to induce conformational and morphological modifications in the sf
fibers, thereby increasing crystallinity, mechanical strength and water stability.”
superhydrophobic and self-cleaning films have also been developed by creating
hierarchical micro-/nano-structures on soy protein film surfaces with hydrophobi
nanoparticles.!72 73] adjusting the precursor concentration and crystal growth
time constructed hierarchical micro-/nano-crystals on the soy protein film surface

transitioned lysozyme (ptl) films. superhydrophobic coatings were generated
through covalent attachment of perfluorooctanyl chloride on the surface, while
superhydrophilic films were generated through the grafting of hydrophilic
polymer poegma. (figure 8b,c). thermal stability of the superhydrophobic ptl

recording sem images of the surface morphology and the contact angle. as seen

the factor that minimized denaturation, as protein films generated in a pressure
chamber show significant denaturation.22] it was hypothesized that the fluorous
environment provided by the fluoro-silane mold minimized protein
rearrangement at the interface, thereby preserving protein structure.
consequently, fluorous-cured protein films were generated by heating protein
film in a fluorous solvent pfhp (perfluoroperhydrophenanthrene), as shown in
igure 6a.2i this resulted in water-stable protein films that are hydrophilic as
compared to heat-cured (hc) protein films both treated at 180 °c for 15 min, as
shown in figure 6b. pfhp-treated films retain most of their secondary structure
as determined by cd spectra (figure 6c). they also retain their surface charge, as
evidenced by kpfm measurements of the surface potential shown in figure 6d,
where the potential difference between hc-bsa and hc-lyso films is significantly
lesser than pfhp-bsa and pfhp-lyso. this indicates that distinct surface charges
of bsa (-) and lyso (+) is retained during pfhp treatment. furthermore, this
strategy was successfully utilized to generate conformal protein coatings on 3d
substrates, as seen in figure 6e by brilliant blue staining and sem images of
protein coatings on dental screws — a model medical implant. as shown in

enzymatic chemical crosslinking is another natural, nontoxic strategy for
fabrication of protein films. enzymes that characterize covalent bond formation
between amino acid residues (e.g., sulfhydryl oxidases that catalyze formation of
disulfide bonds, peroxidases that catalyze formation of radicals, and
transglutaminase (tgase) that catalyzes acyl-transfer reactions between protein
residues) are ideal enzymes for this strategy.'4l for instance, tgase has been
utilized for the crosslinking of collagen fibers by catalyzing intra- and interchain
bonds between lysine and glutamine residues.{55] tgase crosslinking when
combined with thermal treatment notably improved crosslinking efficiency,
stabilized film thickness, and improved mechanical and thermal stability.

covalent crosslinking strategies are applicable to a number of proteins, and

concern with crosslinking strategies is increased cytotoxicity either from the
crosslinkers themselves or from the resultant by-products. while this review
highlights some progress in the development of nontoxic and biodegradable
crosslinking strategies, further research on the scalability of these approaches is
desired.

2.3 thermal treatment strategies

thermal treatment of protein films is a promising additive-free strategy to
generate water stable films. high temperatures utilized in thermal treatment
cause reorganization of native proteins resulting in physical crosslinking, thereby
generating water-stable films.5l heat-cured films have been generated using
plant-isolated proteins such as canola,®71 soy,!®4l vicilin,®%i and whey protein.©)
several reports also indicate that heat-curing improved the mechanical stability ir
addition to water stability.{6"*) furthermore, aging treatments that control both
the relative humidity and temperature during treatment have been used to
modulate mechanical properties such as tensile strength of collagen films.{651

one of the main limitations of thermal treatment is the loss of protein structure
due to heat-induced denaturation. loss of protein structure often results in loss
of protein properties (e.g,, surface charge, hydrophilicity), thereby limiting the
applicability of films in functional materials. a recently developed thermal
treatment strategy using nanoimprint lithography (nil) preserves the structure
and surface functionality of native proteins while generating water-stable films.
(661 as depicted in figure 5a), a fluorosilane coated silicon mold was used to apply
pressure during heat curing of spin-casted protein films. treatment at 180 °c at
3 mpa results in stable, hydrophilic protein films (figure 5b). circular dichroism
(cd) spectra (figure 5c)) revealed that most of the secondary structure was
retained, while kelvin probe force microscopy (kpfm) demonstrated retention of
the protein native charge in the film. positive, negative and neutral films were
generated using bovine serum albumin (bsa; pl = 4.8), hemoglobin (hemo; pl =
6.8), and lysozyme (lyso; pl = 11). charged protein films were utilized to dictate
cell adhesion on the substrate. as seen in figure 5d) anionic and neutral protein
films generated using bsa and hemo result in cytophobic films that prevent cell
adhesion, while cationic lyso results in cytophilic films that enhance cell
adhesion. nil also facilitated fabrication of patterned protein films that dictated
cell alignment.

films, without manipulating their native protein primary structure. the resultant
protein films retain most of their native protein properties. however, there are a
limited number of naturally-occurring structural proteins that exhibit this
behavior. therefore, various physical or chemical treatments must be employed
to obtain varied functionalities in these self-assembled protein films, which may
affect the native protein structure by causing denaturation, increase cytotoxicity
of the film, or affect the functional properties of the protein film.

2.2 crosslinked protein films

self-assembling structural proteins offer an efficient and additive-free approach
for fabricating protein films. however, there are a limited number of these
proteins and they often need to be treated through chemical or physical
treatment strategies to suit biomedical applications. consequently, crosslinkers
offer an alternative approach to utilize a wider array of proteins to generate
water-stable films while also enhancing film properties. crosslinking is typically
conducted through 1) physical strategies that utilize noncovalent interactions
between two proteins such as ionic interactions and hydrogen bonding, or 2)
chemical strategies that result in covalent bonding between proteins

accomplished through irradiation, sulfur vulcanization and chemical reagents.2°.

significant research has been conducted in the development of composite
protein films fabricated through physical crosslinking strategies, often with other
proteins or biopolymers. this approach allows for efficient manipulation of
biophysical properties of protein films such as strength, elasticity, roughness,
degradability and biocompatibility. for instance, the physical properties of
natively self-assembling silk fibroin films and scaffolds were modulated through
blending with biopolymers such as hyaluronic acid (ha) using a freezing-
annealing technique to induce self-assembly of stable sf/ha scaffolds. figure 3a
demonstrates the freezing-annealing technique — sf chains for silk 1 form crystal
networks upon freezing at -80 °c, and upon annealing at 3-5 °c silk crystals trap
ha.5] increasing ha increases water solubility, indicating that sf crystals are
unable to effectively trap the high number of ha chains (figure 3b). surface
morphologies observed through sem imaging (figure 3c-f) show interconnected
microporous morphologies with a typical irregular fusiform shape. increased ha
content did not change the morphology significantly, though the average pore
size gradually decreased. ha, being a component of the extracellular matrix,
enhances cell growth in the composite protein films, while sf provides
mechanical stability.

structural proteins with highly repetitive amino acid sequences such as silk,
collagen, keratin, elastin etc. naturally self-assemble into water-stable protein
films upon processing through the methods described in section ill of figure 2.
19, 30,31] protein films can be efficiently fabricated using these naturally self-
assembling proteins to form robust, biocompatible and biodegradable coatings.
for instance, silk fibroin protein has been used to fabricate protein films for
biomedical applications due to the biocompatibility, slow degradation and robust
mechanical properties of the resulting films.2235] silk fibroin self-assembles into
b-sheets that result in water-stable films. film properties such as mechanical
strength and biodegradability can be enhanced by controlling b-sheet percentage
through different strategies such water annealing, methanol annealing and dryinj
speed.36 37] figure 2 summarizes different strategies for the preparation of silk
protein solution, processing methods for film formation, and strategies for the
manipulation of film properties.

1 introduction

proteins are sustainable, biocompatible and biodegradable building blocks for
designing materials." 4 proteins naturally feature a variety of functionalities — for
instance, structural proteins like collagen are widely used in biomedical
applications due to their abundance in the extracellular matrix. silk fibroin and
soy protein isolate films have been used as food packaging materials". 5i as well
as in the fabrication of medical devices,'®.71 due to their ready availability, efficien
processability, biodegradability and biocompatibility. ° furthermore, the
process of isolating proteins and fabricating protein-based materials can be
conducted with limited use of organic solvents, as most proteins are water
soluble.!"°"2] therefore, protein are an attractive approach for designing
sustainable materials for biomedical applications and as a consequence further
research towards goals 3 (good health and well-being) and 12 (responsible
consumption and production) of the un sustainable development goals.

abstract

proteins are naturally occurring functional building blocks that are useful for
the fabrication of materials. naturally-occurring proteins are biodegradable
and most are biocompatible and nontoxic, making them attractive for the
fabrication of biomaterials. moreover, the fabrication of protein-based
materials can be conducted in a green and sustainable manner due to their
high aqueous solubility. consequently, the applicability of protein-based
materials is limited by their aqueous and mechanical instability. this review
summarizes strategies for the stabilization of protein films, highlighting their
salient features and potential limitations. applications of protein films ran,
from food packaging materials, tissue engineering scaffolds, antimicrobial
coatings etc. are also discussed. finally, the need for robust and efficient
fabrication strategies for translation to commercial applications as well as
