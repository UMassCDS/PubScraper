abstract -

this letter presents a search for the production of new heavy resonances decaying into a
higgs boson and a photon using proton-proton collision data at \/s = 13 tev collected by the
atlas detector at the lhc. the data correspond to an integrated luminosity of 139 fb. the
analysis is performed by reconstructing hadronically decaying higgs boson (h — bb)
candidates as single large-radius jets. a novel algorithm using information about the jet
constituents in the center-of-mass frame of the jet is implemented to identify the two b quarks
in the single jet. no significant excess of events is observed above the expected background.
upper limits are set on the production cross-section times branching fraction for narrow spin-
l resonances decaying into a higgs boson and a photon in the resonance mass range from
0.7 to 4 tey, cross-section times branching fractions are excluded between 11.6 fb and

0.11 fb at a 95% confidence level.
