abstract -

we reevaluate the electric dipole moment (edm) of charged leptons in the standard mode!
using hadron effective models. we find unexpectedly large edm generated by the hadron
level long-distance effect, d. = 5.8 x 10, d,, = 14x 10, and d, = -7.3 x 10-® e em, with
an error bar of 70%, exceeding the conventionally known four-loop level elementary
contribution by several orders of magnitude.
