citation excerpt :
how it does so remains an open question, given that 1) morning
wake did not seem to influence initial afternoon encoding levels
and 2) that our analyses revealed no obvious differences in
afternoon nap stage distribution or microstructure between the
nap-nap and wake-nap conditions. however, one possible
explanation is that morning wake resulted in greater interference
for longer-term consolidation and retrieval of items learned in the
afternoon, despite no disruption of immediate afternoon recall
(spencer, 2021). additionally, itis possible that our measures of nap
architecture and microstructure were not sensitive enough to pick
up on important memory-relevant sleep changes brought about by
‘morning nap deprivation, such as changes in the ratios of spindles
coupled to slow oscillations (solano, riquelme, perez-chada, &
della-maggiore, 2021) or changes in expression of hormones
regulated by sleep and involved in memory and learning (e.g.
cortisol; tribble, dmitrieva, watamura, & lebourgeois, 2015)...

..understanding the temporal relationship between learning and
napping is important because the more time that passes between
learning and test, regardless of whether that delay includes a nap,
the more opportunities there are for interference and forgetting
(muzzio & rovee-collier, 1996). however, it is often difficult to
distinguish between sleep’s role as a protective mechanism against
interference versus its role in enhancing the learning that occurred
prior to sleep (cai & rickard, 2009; rickard, cai, rieth, jones, & ard,
2008; see spencer, 2021). an experimental manipulation of the
timing of sleep relative to learning could be useful for further
understanding of infants’ memory consolidation...

citation excerpt :
..although sleep is dynamic and changes across development,
particularly with the transition out of napping in early childhood,
there is clear evidence that naps may be necessary for learning and
memory early in development. a recent review highlights that naps
confer both immediate and delayed benefits on declarative,
emotional, and procedural learning across infancy and childhood
(see spencer, 2021 for review). in particular, physiology in these
naps (sleep spindles and sws) has been shown to play a role in
supporting these memories (hahn et al., 2019; kurdziel et al., 2013;

recent studies suggest that the benefit of naps on cognition
may extend to executive functions as well. for instance, when
children are presented with unsolvable puzzles (that

the puzzle), children (30-36months) were more frustrated
and exhibited more negative emotions when nap deprived
compared to when they were presented with the same task
following a routine nap. moreover, positive emotions were

nap length is variable at this age, with most studies reporting
70-90min sleep bouts (giganti et al., 2014; kurdziel, duclos,

shorter with increasing age during this time, nap length does
not always correlate with age. however, several factors

factors (e.g,, light, noise) and time of day (with later naps

translational significance: implications for early
education settings

the study of naps in early childhood has important
translational significance. currently, a nap opportunity is
required in accredited preschools by most governing bodies
in the united states (45 cer. § 1302.31; 606 cmr. § 7.11; 22
c.cr. § 101230). however, as early education curriculum
expands and time becomes constrained, it becomes critical to
demonstrate a role of naps in meeting the objectives of early
education, for example, if naps in early childhood support
cognitive function, as...

introduction

 

acommon milestone in early childhood is the transition from.
a biphasic sleep pattern, characterized by two naps per day,
to a monophasic sleep pattern in which sleep is consolidated
toa single overnight sleep bout. although transitional during
the preschool years (around 3-5 years of age), for some
children it can be difficult or even impossible to be deprived

of this mid-day sleep bout.

moreover, most childcare providers will describe the napless
child as giddy, grumpy, or wavering between these opposing
states. this response to nap deprivation is consistent with
studies of sleep deprivation in adults. as is the common
perception, when sleep deprived, adults are emotionally

dysregulated napless children may also seem inattentive, a

feeling shared by sleep deprived adults. as adults, we also
recognize that when we do sleep, we are less forgetful and
more reasonable with our emotions.

 

given this lay appreciation for both the benefits of sleep and
the impairments from sleep deprivation, it may then seem
obvious that naps should be supported in early childhood,
particularly in daycare-type settings with routines and
policies. however, casual observations suggest otherwise;
often parents are too busy to allow a nap opportunity, school
curriculums are too time demanding to allow a sufficient
interval of time for napping, or parents discourage napping
out of concern it will reduce overnight sleep. although this
area has long been understudied, here we review a wealth of
recent studies on the role of naps in cognitive functions in
early childhood.
abstract

while sleep, including naps, has been shown to benefit many
cognitive functions in adults, understanding whether naps
are beneficial in early childhood has important translational
implications. here we review recent studies which,
collectively, suggest that naps indeed benefit cognition at this
age. specifically, declarative, motor, and emotional memory
are better if a nap follows learning. executive functions such
as attention and emotion processing are likewise better
following sleep. however, a better understanding of the
mechanism supporting these benefits and the
generalizability to other forms of learning and executive
functions is necessary. it is important for future research to
extend such findings, which may promote the use of naps to
support early education, particularly for learning-impaired
children.
