7. conclusions

due to the very low pig embryo ivp efficiency, which hinders
its use as a model for research, the no/nos system has been
studied as a possible way to modulate oocyte maturation,
sperm capacitation and gamete interaction and so, to
contribute to the improvement of embryo ivp systems in this
species. however, further research is still necessary to fully
understand the implications of the no/nos system in the
reproductive processes of this species.

6. no and embryo development

the data available is limited, mainly developed in mice and
bovine species under in vitro conditions where some studies
are controversial. in mice, despite no was shown to be
involved in the modulation of embryo development (chen et
al., 2001), there is a general agreement concerning the
embryo development inhibition with high concentrations of
no (athanassakis et al. 2000; barroso et al., 1998; sengoku et
al., 2001; wu et al., 2004). it has been described that little
changes in no concentration can severel
embryo development producing cytotoxicity, arresting,
fragmentation, asymmetry, and even cellular apoptosis
(athanassakis et al., 2000; barroso et al., 1998). meanwhile in
bovine species, it was demonstrated that not only no is

bovine species, it was demonstrated that not only no is
required for normal pre-implantation embryo development
(tranguch et al., 2003), but it must be produced within a
limited range of concentration (tesfaye et al., 2006),
suggesting the possibility to optimize the pre-implantation
development by the use of nos inhibitors to attain
physiologically optimal no levels in the culture media
(tesfaye et al., 2006). until now, none of the studies regarding
nos/no in embryo development have been carried out in
porcine species.

5. no at the site of fertilization

in vivo, the endogenous basal release of no in the oviduct
regulates its contraction, and the ciliary beating of the
ciliated epithelial cells (rosselli et al., 1996; zhan et al., 2003).
it regulates the tubal function along the different phases of
the oestrous cycle and induces chemotaxis in human
spermatozoa via activation of the no/sgc/cgmp pathway
(miraglia et al., 2007). furthermore, the endogenous
production of no at the oviductal isthmus and ampulla
shows variations along the oestrous cycle (lapointe et al.,
2006; yilmaz et al., 2012), and has been suggested to play an
important role in gamete and embryo transportation (yilmaz
et al., 2012). in the particular case of the porcine species,
gawronska et al. (2000) determined that enos is the main
important role in gamete and embryo transportation (yilmaz
et al., 2012). in the particular case of the porcine species,
gawronska et al. (2000) determined that enos is the main
nos isoform expressed by the porcine oviduct, in contrast to
other species (bryant et al., 1995; chatterjee et al., 1996).
they also showed the presence of nadph-diaphorase activity
in the porcine oviduct and its fluctuation that suggests a role
for no in the reproductive events taking place in the oviduct.

5.1. no and in vitro fertilization

the studies about the implications of the nos/no system in
ive are scarce and most of them are carried out in mi

 

humans, and bovine species. all these studies agree that no
regulates the fertilization process in vitro in one way or
another, but the controversy in this sense is significant. the
action of no on ivf seems to be “indirect”, more acting on
the sperm functionality determining the fertilization success,
than directly acting on gametes interaction itself (francavilla
et al,, 2000). it has been reported that low concentrations of
no are beneficial for sperm function to fertilize the oocyte
(o'flahertv ptal..2904;sengnkuetal._1998\and high...
et al,, 2000). it has been reported that low concentrations of
no are beneficial for sperm function to fertilize the oocyte
(o'flaherty et al., 2004; sengoku et al., 1998), and high
concentrations have detrimental effects on it (rosselli et al.,
1995). under in vitro conditions, the concentration of no is
variable in the ivf medium since the no is originated in
ifferent sources: spermatozoa, oocytes, and cumulus cells
(in the case that cumulus cells are present) (staicu et al.,
2019). wu et al. (2004) reported in humans that physiological
levels of no are required for the sperm to bind to the zp and
what is clear is that maintaining the physiological
concentration of no by the time of gametes interaction is
essential for ivf. this knowledge would help to increase the
efficiency of the current ivf techniques. unfortunately, the
ifficulties found until now to measure the physiological
concentrations of no are enough not to have precise and
useful data to implement in ivf.

in the case of the porcine species, tichovské et al. (2011)
reported that enos is the main no isoform involved in
gamete interaction; and staicu et al. (2019) showed the
implication of no in the spermatozoa binding to zp and
penetration of the oocyte in ivf. for that purpose, they
included nos inhibitors as l-name and ag to guarantee that
the observed effect came from the no donor. for these
authors, although the concentration of no and other rns in
the ivf medium can determine the fertilization success, the
presence or absence of one of the main sources of no, the
cumulus cells, did not have any influence in their results.
imilar findings were reported in humans (francavilla et al.,
2000; wu et al., 2004) and in mice (herrero et al., 1996). it
seems logical to think that the significance of no on
fertilization can be species-specific and different in vivo vs. in
vitro. according to staicu et al. (2019), the main effect of no
seems to be exerted on ivf through regulating the sperm
capacitation process and mediating the spermatozoa binding
to zp. in this sense, they agreed with previous studies in
humans (sengoku et al., 1998) in which low concentrations of
a no donor increase the spermatozoa binding to the

to zp. in this sense, they agreed with previous studies in
humans (sengoku et al., 1998) in which low concentrations of
a no donor increase the spermatozoa binding to the
hemizona; or herrero et al. (1996), that showed in mice that
the inhibition of no on spermatozoa before ivf could reduce
the later ivf outcome. thus, no effects on ivf seem to be
dose-dependent and the inhibition of the excess production
of no does not produce any advantage. these conclusions
were also achieved in studies in bovine (leal et al., 2009),
human (francavilla et al., 2000) and mice (herrero et al.,
1996).

 

the no also participates in essential processes for
fertilization after the spermatozoa penetrate the oocyte, as.
the oocyte is activated. some studies demonstrated the role
of no activating pig oocytes (petr et al., 2005b) through the
ca?*-dependent sgc/cgmp pathway (petr et al., 2006, petr et
al., 2005a). however, it has been described that no is not an
adequate stimulus for oocyte activation itself (petr et al.,
2005b), but the no-pathway can participate in oocyte
activation as part of a more complex net of metabolic

4.7. acrosome reaction

only capacitated sperm can undergo the acrosomal
exocytosis process near or on the oocyte, which allows the
spermatozoon to penetrate and fertilize it (abou-haila and
tulsiani, 2009; fraser, 1998; jin and yang, 2017). acrosome
reaction is a complex process which appear to be controlled
by cross-talks between different pathways including the no
dependent pathway (herrero and gagnon, 2001).

although the first studies on the participation of no on the
acrosomal reaction were carried out in the human species, it
has now been shown to be a common fact for other
mammalian species including boar (aquila et al., 2011;
acrosomal reaction were carried out in the human species, it
has now been shown to be a common fact for other
mammalian species including boar (aquila et al., 2011;
funahashi, 2002; hou et al., 2008; staicu et al., 2019). it has
been reported that l-arginine and geldamycin (a heat shock
protein 90-specific inhibitor) are able to induce capacitation
and acrosome reaction in boar spermatozoa, through the no
signalling pathway (funahashi, 2002; hou et al., 2008).
aquila et al. (2011) observed augmented no levels in leptin-
treated spermatozoa which indicated the capacity of the
hormone to induce no production and an increase of
acrosome reaction. furthermore, the inhibitory effect of l-
name on the promotion of acrosome reaction triggered by
leptin suggests a possi
it appears that the no produced by the sperm is sufficient to
support the acrosomal reaction despite the fact that cumulus
cells supply no to the sperm along with progesterone (bedu-
addo et al., 2008). it has been demonstrated that
supplementation to capacitation medium of a no donor
(gsno) did not increase the number of sperm that
underwent acrosomal reaction in response to an agonist such
supplementation to capacitation medium of a no donor
(gsno) did not increase the number of sperm that
underwent acrosomal reaction in response to an agonist such
as progesterone, whereas when nos were inhibited, the
response to the agonist decreased (staicu et al., 2019).

of protein kinases and the inactivation of protein
phosphatases (battistone et al., 2013), no can modulate this
process through the activation of the camp/pka pathway
(belén herrero et al., 2000) and it is directly involved in
tyrosine phosphorylation by modulating both the camp/pka
and the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) pathways
(reviewed by staicu and parra, 2017). herrero et al. (2001)
observed an increase in tyrosine phosphorylation when
human sperm capacitation was accelerated by a no-releasing
compound and thundathil et al. (2003) reported that l-
name prevented, and a no donor promoted, the increase in
threonine, glutamine and tyrosine phosphorylation in human
spermatozoa. on the contrary, studies on boar spermatozoa
showed that the phosphorylation levels for pkas decreased
when nos inhibitors were used (staicu et al., 2019). however,
the phosphorylation levels of tyrosine residues, were not
modified nor in the presence of the no donor nor when nos
was inhibited (staicu et al., 2019). aquila et al. (2013) used

nevertheless, these experiments were carried out under non-
capacitating conditions.

 

 

 

4.6. phosphatidylserine translocation

phospholipids are asymmetrically distributed in the plasma
membrane. this asymmetrical distribution is disrupted
during apoptosis and sperm capacitation. during sperm
capacitation the scramblases are activated and consequently,
an exposure of phosphatidylserine (ps) and
phosphatidylethanolamine (pe) at the outer surface are
produced (gadella and harrison, 2002). since both
capacitation and apoptosis are redox-regulated, it is tempting
to speculate that they are part of a continuous process and
no might participate in both processes.

 

when the oxidative stress associated with capacitation

auvarwhelme the limited antinvidant dafanrec afforad hur
no might participate in both processes.

when the oxidative stress associated with capacitation
overwhelms the limited antioxidant defences offered by
spermatozoa, the cells enter the intrinsic apoptotic cascade.
events observed during the intrinsic apoptotic cascade are
the activation of caspases in the sperm cytosol and the
surface expression of ps (aitken et al., 2015). moran et al.
(2008), showed that no induces a dramatic increase in the
percentage of spermatozoa with caspase activity despite no
playing a major role in boar sperm capacitation (hou et al.,
2008). in this sense, it has been showed that yo-pro-1 and
annexin-v staining reflect the same physiological or
pathological conditions in spermatozoa (hou et al., 2008;
pefia et al., 2004), probably identifying the same event. in
fact, an increase in annexin-positive spermatozoa has been
shown to be related to capacitation in boar semen (gadella
and harrison, 2002).

 

in boar spermatozoa, the capacitating agents have been
shown to induce rapid changes in the membrane lipid
architecture such as the external exposure of ps, which is also
in boar spermatozoa, the capacitating agents have been
shown to induce rapid changes in the membrane lipid
architecture such as the external exposure of ps, which is also
commonly recognized as a marker of apoptosis (aitken et al.,
2015). however, staicu et al. (2019), observed that no donor
had no significant effect on ps externalization even though
the nos inhibition decreased this effect.

 
4.4. calcium uptake during sperm capacitation

intracellular ca?* influx is one of the crucial biochemical
events occurring during capacitation (abou-haila and
tulsiani, 2009) to activate one or more enzymatic pathways
and the ryrs are implicated in the ca** movement. kakizawa
et al. (2013) showed that a no-induced ca?* elevation was
accompanied by an increase in s-nitrosylation levels of
endogenous ryrs. on the other hand, the inhil
ca?* channels can occur under strong nitrosylating conditions
or at high doses of no (hart and dulhunty, 2000).

 

ition of these

in boar sperm, staicu et al. (2019) monitored ca* levels
before and after treatment with a no donor or nos inhibitors
under capacitating conditions. the authors observed that the
inhibitor l-name abruptly reduced the intracellular ca2*
concentration at a basal level, while with ag the reduction
was more gradual, and the donor did not exhibit an effect.
inhibitor l-name abruptly reduced the intracellular ca2*
concentration at a basal level, while with ag the reduction
was more gradual, and the donor did not exhibit an effect.
they hypothesized that in l-name presence, ca?* ions get
expelled quickly from spermatozoa mainly through the ca2*
efflux pump, plasma membrane calcium atpase 4 (pmca4),
which is known to regulate no signalling by downregulating
the noss in murine sperm (olli et al., 2018). additionally,
when l-name was used, it was hypothesized that the
pmca4-nos interaction might not have taken place, which in
turn might have led pmca4 to extrude the cytosolic ca?*.
unfortunately, to our knowledge, the lack of literature
regarding the effect of no on ca?* mobilization in porcine
sperm during capacitation prevents us from extending this
review.

 
4.3. motility

during sperm capacitation the sperm motility changes to a
hyperactive movement. for this event to occur, the
mobilization of stored ca* in the sperm neck/midpiece
during sperm capacitation the sperm motility changes to a
hyperactive movement. for this event to occur, the
mobilization of stored ca* in the sperm neck/midpiece
placed in the redundant nuclear envelope is necessary (bedu-
addo et al., 2008; costello et al., 2009). to mobilize ca2* from
these storages it is necessary to enable ryanodine receptors
(ryrs) - the intracellular ca?* release channels involved in
regulation of cytosolic ca** levels (kakizawa et al., 2013).
these proteins contain a large number of thiol groups and are
thus subject to s-nitrosylation by no (takeshima et al., 1989).
s-nitrosylation can potentiate opening of ryrs, probably by
generation of the membrane permeant product cys-no
(zhang and hogg, 2004).

 

in porcine species, research has focused mainly on addressing
the involvement of no in the promotion of capacitation
(reviewed by staicu and parra, 2017), lacking studies that
address the effect on sperm motility. although intracellular
no is essential for proper sperm function (herrero et al.,
1994; yeoman et al., 1998), no has a dose-dependent, dual
effect on sperm motility (rosselli et al., 1995; wang et al.,
au ts essenbartor plopersperm wuncuon rerrero et at,
1994; yeoman et al., 1998), no has a dose-dependent, dual
effect on sperm motility (rosselli et al., 1995; wang et al.,
2014; weinberg et al., 1995).

under non-capacitating conditions, jovitic et al. (2018)
observed that the inhibition of no by selective or non-
selective nos inhibitors showed different effects on boar
sperm motility. at 72h of sperm storage, the selective inos

1 ag at a concentration of 0.625mm increased sperm
kinetic parameters such as alh, vcl, and vsl, which are
related to boar fertility (reviewed by fair and romero-
aguirregomezcorta, 2019). the positive effects of ag on boar
sperm motility might be due to its antioxidant properties and
scavenger activity against free radicals like ros and rns
(yildiz et al., 1998). contrarily, a concentration of 0.625mml-
name showed no effect on boar sperm motility parameters
during the entire period of semen storage (jovitié et al., 2018).
however, ag and l-name at 10mm negatively affected
sperm kinetics and acrosome integrity, which may provide
further support to the notion that low no levels are
necessary for a normal sperm function (herrero et al., 2005).
sperm kinetics and acrosome integrity, which may provide
further support to the notion that low no levels are
necessary for a normal sperm function (herrero et al., 2005).
in this sense, it is necessary to emphasize that no reacts with
superoxide anion and generate the rns, peroxynitrite
(herrero et al., 2001), compromising boar sperm motility
without affecting mitochondrial activity (serrano et al.,
2020). in this sense, despite potentiating the phosphorylation
of important pathways for sperm motility, peroxynitrite also
induces oxidative stress that contributes to the motility
impairment (serrano et al., 2020).

under capacitating conditions, only one study on motility and
no has been found and the results were different from those
described above. this study conducted by staicu et al. (2019)
showed that despite no differences at the beginning of the
incubation period, medium supplementation with ag
significantly reduced vsl and vap after 30min of incubation.
however, the media supplementation with a no donor,

apoptosis (mehraban et al., 2005).

4.2. no pathway involved in sperm capacitation

no in spermatozoa activates the sgc (revelli et al., 2002),
leading to an increase in intracellular levels of cgmp, which
has been implicated in several sperm signalling pathway
functions, such as capacitation, acrosome reaction,
chemotaxis, and sperm-egg interaction (lopez, 2015; staicu
et al., 2019). gmp acts on the following targets involved in
physiological events in mammalian sperm: cyclic nucleotide-
gated channels (cng) (weyand et al., 1994; wiesner et al.,
1998), cgmp-dependent protein kinase (pkg) (miraglia et al.,
2011; rahman et al., 2014) and phosphodiesterase (pde)
(lefievre et al., 2000). all of them result in an increase in
intracellular ca2* levels and protein phosphorylation, which
ultimately results in hvperactivation and acrosomal reaction
(lefievre et al., 2000). all of them result in an increase in
intracellular ca2* levels and protein phosphorylation, which
ultimately results in hyperactivation and acrosomal reaction
of the sperm (lopez, 2015). no can also influence the
camp/pka pathway by activation of sgc and so, it could
modulate directly sperm adenylate cyclase (ac) activity. the
activation of pka represents the point of convergence of
these two pathways (fig. 1).

 

 

another pathway in which no participates in the
capacitation is through protein nitrosylation (machado-
oliveira et al., 2008; mcvey et al., 1999). protein s-
nitrosylation is a reversible post-translational modification
and represents a non-canonical action of no (hess et al.,
2005). this pathway seems to play a role in mature sperm
during their transit in the female reproductive tract (lefiévre
et al,, 2007). the first report that human sperm contains
several important proteins that are targets for s-nitrosylation
was conducted by lefiévre et al. (2007). these authors
demonstrated the presence of many nitrosylated proteins
that were involved in the modulation of sperm functionality.
was conducted by lefiévre et al. (2007). these authors
demonstrated the presence of many nitrosylated proteins
that were involved in the modulation of sperm functionality.
later, it was also demonstrated that s-nitrosylation acts on
the mobilization of stored ca* synergistically to
progesterone by modulating the flagellar action (machado-
oliveira et al., 2008). however, the references found are
scarce and no studies have been found to describe this

 

process in pigs.

as we mentioned before, sperm capacitation involves
modifications that affect motility, ca2* uptake,
phosphatidylserine translocation, protein phosphorylation or
the preparation to acrosome reaction. in all these processes,
no is necessary for a proper sperm functionality (reviewed
by herrero et al., 2005).
4.1. location of nos in boar spermatozoa

the three isoforms of nos have been identified in boar sperm
by western-blotting (aquila et al., 2011) and indirect
immunofluorescence (iif) (staicu et al., 2019). the
immunoblots of sperm samples have shown the presence of
three bands of ~16qkda (bnos), ~130kda (inos)
immunofluorescence (iif) (staicu et al., 2019). the
immunoblots of sperm samples have shown the presence of
three bands of ~160kda (bnos), ~130kda (inos)
and~135kda (enos) (aquila et al., 2011), the if showed that
the enos was identified in the acrosomal region, although a
weak fluorescent signal was also registered in the principal
and end-piece of the flagellum. the nnos associated
fluorescence was concentrated in the sperm head region,
with a lower fluorescence in the principal and end-piece of
the flagellum. immunofluorescent inos staining was spread
over the acrosomal, postacrosomal, and neck region but also
in the principal and end pieces of the tail (staicu et al., 2019).
the location of enos, inos and nnos by iif is shown in fig. 2.

4. no and sperm capacitation

capacitation is a key feature of mammalian sperm cell
jology and provides sperm with a series of behaviours that
are essential for the achievement of fertilization, including
hyperactivated motility, sperm-zona pellucida recognition,
and acrosome exocytosis.

 

the capacitation process implies several changes that occur
sequentially. several molecules are involved in this process
such as bicarbonate, calcium and cholesterol acceptor
(reviewed by lopez, 2015). these substances induce
modifications in the lipid membrane, loss of cholesterol,
activation of camp/pka pathway, increase ca®* uptake and
ph (phi), hyperpolarization of membrane potential, protein
phosphorylation and hypermotility (lishko and kirichok,
2010; liu et al., 2012; nishigaki et al., 2014; soriano-ubeda et
al., 2019; visconti et al., 1999), moreover, other pathways in
phosphorylation and hypermotility (lishko and kirichok,
2010; liu et al., 2012; nishigaki et al., 2014; soriano-ubeda et
al., 2019; visconti et al., 1999). moreover, other pathways in
relation to capacitation, such as no/sgc/cgmp or protein
nitrosylation have been studied (staicu et al., 2019).

no appears to be involved not only in the function of the
male genitourinary system, but also in sperm physiological
processes, such as hyperactivation, capacitation and
acrosome reaction (de lamirande et al., 1997). capacitation
and acrosome reaction are two complex processes whi
appear to be controlled by cross-talks between different
pathways including the no-dependent pathway (reviewed by
lopez, 2015).

 
3. no and oocyte maturation

in the reproductive system, no is an important component of
the oocyte microenvironment. no levels in the follicular fluid
increase with oestrogen concentration during folliculogenesis
(rosselli, 1997), as a result, a functional relationship between
no and follicular development is assumed. the presence of
nos has been demonstrated in the ovarian theca and
granulosa cells of rat (jablonka-shariff and olson, 1997),
mouse (jablonka-shariff and olson, 1998) and pig (takesue et
l903 durin fabiculardeueler vent avuletion.ad
granulosa cells of rat (jablonka-shariff and olson, 1997),
mouse (jablonka-shariff and olson, 1998) and pig (takesue et
al,, 2003) during follicular development, ovulation and
corpus luteum formation. the abundance of enos during
ovulation increases blood flow to the ovary (jablonka-shariff
and olson, 1998; van voorhis et al., 1995), together with the
observation that the infusion of l-nitro arginine methyl ester
(l-name), an enos inhibitor, significantly decreases the
ovulation rate in rats (shukovski and tsafriri, 1994),
supporting a role for no in the regulation of the ovulatory
process (rosselli et al., 1998).

 

no also plays an important role in the regulation of oocyte
maturation (stricker, 2012), acting as an intracellular signal
that triggers the activation of the oocyte (kuo et al., 2000)
and delays female gamete aging (goud et al., 2005). this i
important role since the incidence of polyspermy is higher in
old or aged oocytes (miao et al., 2009). in addition, goud et al.
(2014) determined that no levels of oocytes obtained from
young animals were significantly higher than those of
oocytes obtained from old animals. furthermore, the

(2014) determined that no levels of oocytes obtained from
young animals were significantly higher than those of
oocytes obtained from old animals. furthermore, the
observation that an insufficient amount of no induce the
premature cortical granule exocytosis and subsequent zp
hardening (goud et al., 2005) suggests that no level
regulation can affect both the maturation and fertilization
processes.

 

under various in vitro conditions, it has been shown, that low
no concentrations protect against oxidative stress, stimulate
meiotic maturation (bu et al., 2003; tao et al., 2005, tao et al.,
2004) and extend the temporal window for optimal
fertilization and embryonic development (goud et al., 2008).
on the other hand, high no concentrations in mammalian
oocytes inhibit meiotic maturation, produce oxidative stress
and apoptosis (jablonka-shariff and olson, 2000, jablonka-
shariff and olson, 1998) and disrupt the viability of oocytes
(tichovska et al., 2011). moreover, a lack of no, achieved by
the inhibition of the different nos isoforms, resulted in
suppressed cumulus expansion and inhibition of the meiotic
(tichovska et al., 2011). moreover, a lack of no, achieved by
the inhibition of the different nos isoforms, resulted in
suppressed cumulus expansion and inhibition of the meiotic
resumption (tao et al., 2005). in other words, no plays a dual
role in the reproductive system depending on its
concentration: at low concentrations it stimulates or
enhances early reproductive events, but either an excess or a
lack of no has negative consequences (barroso et al., 1998;
bu et al., 2004; lee et al., 2013).

during in vivo maturation of the oocyte there is a
physiological generation of ros and rns (pandey et al., 2010).
these radicals are also generated in pig ivm (tang et al.,
2013), a lengthy process that takes approximately 44h
(petters and wells, 1993) with possible effects on the
reproductive events that occur after maturation (hao et al.,
2009; ma et al., 2005). however, despite the evidence
pointing to an important relevance of no in ivm, none of the
above-mentioned studies analysed whether the regulation of
no levels during porcine in vitro maturation could affect both
the ivm process and subsequently fertilization and embryo
develonment jn this.canse rapare-aauirxacomezcanta chal.
no levels during porcine in vitro maturation could affect both
the ivm process and subsequently fertilization and embryo
development. in this sense romero-aguirregomezcorta et al.
(2014) hypothesized that a decrease in no synthesis during
ivm would be reflected in a better maturation and,
consequently in improved ivf parameters. the authors
demonstrated that no derived from inos and enos isoforms
might be necessary for the expansion of cumulus cells, that
inos activity is necessary for proper porcine oocyte
maturation and confirmed that enos is the isoform most
directly involved in gamete interaction. finally, they
concluded that the supplementation of the ivm medium
with nos inhibitors or a no donor did not improve the
efficiency of ivf but revealed the importance of no in the
oocyte maturation process and its subsequent impact on
gamete interaction in porcine species (romero-
aguirregomezcorta et al., 2014).

3.1. no pathways involved in oocyte maturation

focusing on the explanation of the effects of no on ivm,
bilodeau-goeseels (2007) first suggested that the inhibitory
effect of no on bovine oocyte meiotic resumption did not
appear to be mediated by the cgmp/pkg pathway; later,
protein s-nitrosylation was reported to occur during in vitro
embryo culture in mice (lee et al., 2013); and finally, romero-
aguirregomezcorta et al. (2014) demonstrated for the first
time that no exerts its effect on porcine oocyte ivm via
protein s-nitrosylation. they observed that the inhibition of
inos during maturation (by aminoguanidine (ag)) produced
a lower s-nitrosylation rate in porcine oocytes and that these
poorly s-nitrosylated oocytes showed a lower ability to
resume meiosis. these results agreed with lee et al. (2013),
who reported that the use of a nos inhibitor to eliminate no
production had deleterious effects on embryo development.
however, they could not conclude that nos inhibition in
porcine ivm has detrimental effects on the developmental
ability of the oocyte, until it becomes clear which proteins are
nitrosylated in the oocyte and what their functions are.

oxidative phosphorylation by inactivating iron-sulphur
centres, and decreases protein synthesis by an unknown
mechanism (curran et al., 1991; stuehr and griffith, 1992).

 
2.1. no synthesis

no is synthesized through the action of nitric oxide synthase
(nos), which, from amino acid l-arginine and 02, produces
no and l-citrulline in the presence of the coenzyme
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (nadph)
(kwon et al., 1990; lamas et al., 1992; moncada et al., 1991).
three nos isoforms are found in a variety of cell types and
more than one isoform can be present in the same cell type
(van voorhis et al., 1994). neuronal nos (nnos or nos type i)
and endothelial nos (enos or nos type iii), also called
constitutive nos (férstermann et al., 1998), are responsible
(van voorhis et al., 1994). neuronal nos (nnos or nos type i)
and endothelial nos (enos or nos type iii), also called
constitutive nos (férstermann et al., 1998), are responsible
for the continuous basal no release. these isoforms are
independent of the physiological demand for no and require
ca®* and calmodulin for activation (griffith and stuehr, 1995;
moncada et al., 1991). a third isoform, inducible nos (inos or
nos type il} is ca?*-independent and is expressed in response
to inflammatory cytokines and lipopolysaccharides (morris
and billiar, 1994).

2.2. no mechanism of action

the effects of no were initially thought to be solely mediated
by the activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sgc) to produce
variable amounts of cyclic guanosine monophosphate
(cgmp), which in turn, activates cgmp-dependent protein
kinases (pkgs), cgmp-gated cation channels and cgmp
regulated phosphodiesterase (pdes) (doshi et al., 2012;
rosselli et al., 1998) (fig. 1). the binding of cgmp activates
pkg, phosphorylating serine and threonine residues in many
refulacce’pirispiuieseie (roes7(woshrartiiy fpcton
rosselli et al., 1998) (fig. 1). the binding of cgmp activates
pkg, phosphorylating serine and threonine residues in many
cellular proteins and causing changes in the activity, function,
location and regulatory characteristics (francis et al., 2010).
however, it was later suggested that no can also signal
through non-cgmp-mediated pathways by means of protein
s-nitrosylation (ji et al., 1999; zhang and hogg, 2005). this is
a redox-dependent, thiol-based, reversible post-translational
protein modification that involves attachment of a no moiety
toa protein sulfhydryl group.

nitric oxide (no) in the spermatozoa activates the soluble
guanylyl cyclase (sgc), leading to an increase in intracellular
levels of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cgmp). the cgmp
can activate the cyclic nucleotide-gated channels (cng)
localized in the flagellum of mammalian spermatozoa, which
regulate the influx of ca?* ions to the cytoplasm during the
capacitation process and also activates the cgmp-dependent
protein kinase (pkg), leading to the serine/threonine
phosphorylation of different proteins. it can also inhibit cyclic
adenosine monophosphate (camp) degradation via cvclic
protein kinase (pkg), leading to the serine/threonine
phosphorylation of different proteins. it can also inhibit cyclic
adenosine monophosphate (camp) degradation via cyclic
nucleotide phosphodiesterase (pde), which leads to the
activation of camp-dependent protein kinase a (pka) and
tyrosine phosphorylation. furthermore, no is involved in the
tyrosine phosphorylation process in a direct manner, by
activating adenylate cyclase (ac) and the extracellular signal-
regulated kinase (erk) pathway. finally, no determines post-
translational protein modification in spermatozoa via s-

them, no was classified as reactive nitrogen species (rns), a
subclass of reactive oxygen species (ros) (sikka, 2012). in
cells, it diffuses at any point across the membrane and acts as
a molecular messenger. despite its molecular simplicity, no
is produced and released from many cell types in the body,
where it acts either as a neurotransmitter or as a paracrine
agent (francis et al., 2010).
1. introduction

porcine species is very important in the field of animal
production. however, from a biomedical point of view, swine
play a role that is less commonly known in society than meat
production but just as important. the high prolificacy and
low maintenance costs of this species makes it a widely
accepted experimental model. in fact, pig is considered an
ideal animal model for the study and development of new
therapies for human diseases because of the genetic,
anatomical, and physiological similarities with humans (luo
et al., 2012; nagashima et al., 2012).

therapies for human diseases because of the genetic,
anatomical, and physiological similarities with humans (luo
et al., 2012; nagashima et al., 2012).

as a result of these qualities and the need for a large number
of embryos for research purposes and for the production of
transgenic animals in the late 1980s and 1990s the in vitro
production (ivp) of porcine embryos became widespread.
however, the efficiency of porcine embryo ivp remains very
low, especially when compared with other species of interest
in animal husbandry, which hinders its use as a research
model (grupen, 2014).

the high degree of polyspermic fertilization is the main
problem that affects in vitro fertilization (ivf) in porcine
species (romar et al., 2019), and, as a consequence, most
work to date has focused on studying the conditions affecting
ivf. furthermore, oocyte in vitro maturation (ivm) is another
important step that could be related to polyspermic
fertilization and low embryo production (grupen, 2014).

fertilization and low embryo production (grupen, 2014).

as the final processes of gamete maturation, fertilization and
the beginning of embryonic development take place in the
oviduct (reviewed by coy et al., 2012); and because, under
physiological conditions, the success rate of the different
stages are very high (grupen, 2014), it seems reasonable to
assume that a greater knowledge of the oviductal physiology
would provide useful data for the improvement of pig
embryo ivp systems. in this sense, molecules such as nitric
oxide (no), a very simple but practically ubiquitous molecule
involved in many processes of intra- and extracellular
signalling, have been investigated as possible ways to
enhance pig embryo ivp systems (romero-
aguirregomezcorta et al., 2014; staicu et al., 2019).

in porcine species, the presence of nitric oxide synthase
(nos), the enzyme that produces no, has been detected in
the oviduct (gawronska et al., 2000), the ovary (kim et al.,
2005), the oocyte and the cumulus cells (chmelikova et al.,
2009) and in the spermatozoon (aquila et al., 2011; staicu et
the ovidiict'| gawronska et al., zuu0), the ovary (kim ét al.,
2005), the oocyte and the cumulus cells (chmelikova et al.,
2009) and in the spermatozoon (aquila et al., 2011; staicu et
al., 2019). moreover, functions related to oviductal activity
regulation (gawronska et al., 2000), follicular development
and ovulation (kim et al., 2005), acquisition of meiotic
competence (chmelikova et al., 2009), oocyte activation (petr
et al. 2005b), sperm capacitation (aquila et al., 2011; hou et
al., 2008) and gamete interaction (staicu et al., 2019) have
been linked to this molecule.

 

there is a consistent agreement about the modulating effect
of nos/no on both gametes, masculine (staicu et al., 2019;
wang et al., 2014) and feminine (goud et al., 2005; romero-
aguirregomezcorta et al., 2014; tao et al., 2005), but the
studies about the interaction between both gametes are
scarce and sometimes even contradictive (francavilla et al.,
2000; o'flaherty et al., 2004; rosselli et al., 1998; sengoku et
al., 1998). the no synthesis presents clear patterns of time
and spatial distribution that are considered important for the
ifferent events surrounding fertilization (reyes et al., 2004).
however, there are sfil].many.uvanswered auestions relating
and spatial distribution that are considered important for the
ifferent events surrounding fertilization (reyes et al., 2004).
however, there are still many unanswered questions relating
to its exact function.

 

 

in light of this, in the following sections, after a brief
explanation of the no biosynthesis and mechanism of action,
we develop the current knowledge on the role of no/nos
system in each of the assisted reproductive techniques that
lead to the production of porcine embryos in an in vitro
environment, i.e. oocyte maturation, sperm capacitation, in
vitro fertilization and embryo culture. we also discuss the
possible ways in which the no/nos system could be used to
enhance ivp of porcine embryos.

the importance of porcine species for meat production is
undeniable. due to the genetic, anatomical, and physiological
imilarities with humans, from a biomedical point of view,
pig is considered an ideal animal model for the study and
development of new therapies for human diseases. the in
vitro production (ivp) of porcine embryos has become
widespread as a result of these qualities and there is
significant demand for these embryos for research purposes.
however, the efficiency of porcine embryo ivp remains very
low, which hinders its use as a model for research. the high

furthermore, oocyte in vitro maturation (ivm) is another
important step that could be related to polyspermic

nitric oxide synthase (nos), the enzyme that produces nitric
oxide (no), has been detected in the oviduct, the ovary, the
oocyte and the sperm cell of porcine species. its functions
include regulating oviductal activity, ovulation, acquisition of
meiotic competence, oocyte activation, sperm capacitation,
and gamete interaction. therefore, in this review, we
summarize the current knowledge on the role of no/nos
system in each of the steps that lead to the production of
porcine embryos in an in vitro environment, i.e. ivm, sperm
capacitation, ivf, and embryo culture. we also discuss the
possible ways in which the no/nos system could be used to
enhance ivp of porcine embryos.
