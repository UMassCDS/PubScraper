abstract

pyrolysis is a promising treatment for soil remediation for
rapidity and fertility preservation. but it is difficult to
establish the relationship between pyrolysis behaviors and
soil organic matter (som) structures, for som is a mixture of
heterogeneous compounds. ha sub-fractions from the same
soil source may provide a series of promising objects to
understand som at molecular level and the resulting patterns
in som pyrolysis. we first propose a novel insight into
pyrolysis mechanism response to molecular signatures using
electrospray ionization fourier transform ion cyclotron
resonance mass spectrometry (ft-icr ms) combined with
thermogravimetric analysis (tga) to study six humic acid
(ha) sub-fractions extracted from a forest soil. the findings
resonance mass spectrometry (ft-icr ms) combined with
thermogravimetric analysis (tga) to study six humic acid
(ha) sub-fractions extracted from a forest soil. the findings
indicate that decomposition of soil ha occurs systematically
due to molecular signatures. the decomposition can be
categorized as carboxyl controlled (below 280°c), lipid-
dominated (280-450°c) and condensed aromatics-
dominated processes (450-700°c). predominant reaction
mechanism of all ha sub-fractions was random nucleation
(a>0.25). lipid in ha tend to initiate multiple nuclei in
thermal degradation, while condensed aromatics tend to
initiate and grow centering single random point in higher
conversion rate («>0.75). bridging the molecular signature
and thermogravimetry reveals that the pyrolysis stage below
350°c should be divided into two distinct processes related
to the carboxylic group and lipid compounds, although this
stage has conventionally been considered as a single process.
the n element of ha was mostly preserved in the condensed
aromatics which was mainly pyrolyzed above 450°c,
suggesting that pyrolysis below 450°c is a preferable
remediation treatment considering nitrogen fertility

can be applied as a targeted remediation procedure for
contaminated soils and can improve the understanding of
som thermal behaviors at the molecular level.
