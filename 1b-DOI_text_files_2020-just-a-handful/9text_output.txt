5 discussion

the ability to produce and manage knowledge is a critical source of competitive
advantage for organizations of all types (argote, 2012; hargadon & sutton, 1997).
yet the knowledge production process is both time-intensive and uncertain
(maggitti, smith, & katila, 2013). to address this issue, the premise of this article is
based on the notion that “engineering serendipity” can promote greater
knowledge sharing and more efficient knowledge production. we systematically
examine how the degree of field and intellectual similarity between knowledge
sharing partners affects the likelihood that engineered encounters affects three
knowledge production outcomes: knowledge transfer, creation, and diffusion.

 

we find both cooperative and competitive effects of serendipitous knowledge
sharing on knowledge production. on the one hand, knowledge sharing leads to
greater knowledge transfer and creation when people share some overlapping
research interests: knowledge sharing partners are more likely to transfer and

mash lavainrde fram qne annthar whan thay alraary have coma

sharing on knowledge production. on the one hand, knowledge sharing leads to
greater knowledge transfer and creation when people share some overlapping
research interests: knowledge sharing partners are more likely to transfer and
acquire mesh keywords from one another when they already have some
intellectual overlap and more likely to copublish when they share field overlap,
with field similarity being more critical to collaborations in the near-term than
over longer horizons. on the other hand, knowledge sharing appears to have little
benefit for pairs with low knowledge similarity and reduces knowledge diffusion
between people from the same field: we observe that pairs from the same field
are less likely to cite each other after interacting.

 

these findings make a number of contributions to the literature. first, we
contribute to the literature on search costs and information frictions associated
with knowledge production (agrawal & goldfarb, 2008; boudreau et al., 2017;
catalini, 2018; hansen, 1999; szulanski, 1996), by focusing on the extent that
“engineered serendipity” can mitigate some of these barriers. engineered,
serendipitous encounters differ from traditional knowledge production
mechanisms because they give people a common time and space to meet,
thereby removing some of the search costs associated with finding suitable
knowledge sharing partners. our work suggests that engineered serendipity
creates opportunities for synergistic collaborations over the long-run that have
the potential to broaden collaboration networks and reshape research
trajectories. consistent with the information frictions explanation, knowledge

creates opportunities for synergistic collaborations over the long-run that have
the potential to broaden collaboration networks and reshape research
trajectories. consistent with the information frictions explanation, knowledge
overlap is a greater constraint on near-term than long-term knowledge creation.
knowledge similarity can be a catalyzing force for near-term research activities
because there are fewer start-up costs and uncertainties associated with initiating
collaborations with similar others, such as people working in the same field. in
boudreau et al. (2017), we found that the knowledge sharing intervention's effect
on grant coapplications was most beneficial for pairs from the same field. this
suggests that in the short-term, opportunity and discretion remain important
factors driving knowledge production (dahlander & mcfarland, 2013). we expand
on these findings to show that while field overlap remains a difficult hurdle to
overcome in the near-term, over time, scientists place smaller premiums on
knowledge similarity, instead emphasizing synergistic collaborations where
partners have both common knowledge and divergent expertise. this shift may
be due to the time and repeated interactions needed to develop an initial
encounter into a multiplex relationship (ingram & mortis, 2007; uzzi, 1997), or the
evolving expectations from collaborators as projects move from exploratory
research to joint execution of research ideas. they also suggest that homophilous
collaborations (dahlander & mcfarland, 2013) can be attributed in part to search
costs and information costs.

 

 

 

second, this study advances understanding of how opportunities for temporary

costs and information costs.

second, this study advances understanding of how opportunities for temporary
colocation, offered by conferences, symposia and similar events potentially
impact the direction and quality of scientific knowledge production. although
prior research suggests that temporary colocation is critical to knowledge
production (campos et al., 2018; catalini, 2018; catalini et al., 2020; chai &
freeman, 2019), it has typically inferred face-to-face interaction from
observational data, rather than actual acts of knowledge sharing. we suggest that
one attractive aspect of conferences over informal serendipitous encounters (e.g.
in hallways, watercoolers) is that they have a focusing effect on the topic of
knowledge sharing and idea exchange. this may be why even brief, highly
structured, information-rich interventions can have long-term consequences on
knowledge production, most notably by promoting research activities on the
conference's topics of inquiry. it is important to note that the effects of these
events go beyond monetary incentives, which may be an early catalyst to attract
participants but the effects are more widespread and longer lasting.

 

 

third, we make empirical and methodological contributions by designing a
prospective study that amalgamates multiple sources and uses of data, namely a
natural field experiment, direct observations of face-to-face communications and
archival publication data to study long-run knowledge production outcomes. this
careful combination of data sources enables us to investigate the causal

prospocescowuay tier arta gurriancrtnanproacurees are amcote racer
natural field experiment, direct observations of face-to-face communications and
archival publication data to study long-run knowledge production outcomes. this
careful combination of data sources enables us to investigate the causal
relationships between knowledge sharing and knowledge production over
different time horizons, which are not possible with archival data (fleming et al.,
2007). given the rise in field experiments in innovation research (chatterji,
delecourt, hasan, & koning, 2019), research designs that at the outset plan for
short- and long-term time horizons may yield deeper insights that can help to
offset the costs associated with multiple forms of data collection. in addition, our
research design can be used as a template for future experiments with multiterm
horizons, in terms of learning from its features and its potential shortcomings.

 

tst

in this research, we have made a thorough effort to analyze how knowledge
sharing leads to knowledge production in science. however, our study has some
empirical limitations. first, our study focused on an interdisciplinary setting in a
large, highly selective university. therefore, it may be interpreted as a best-case
scenario in fostering knowledge production, as we must draw a boundary around
the network and incentives under consideration. the symposium was highly
structured to facilitate knowledge sharing, while knowledge production is a core
activity for academics. second, the geographic proximity of scientists may have
facilitated scheduled or serendipitous encounters with greater ease (catalit
2018). third, our focus on the life sciences also draws upon a specific population,

where intragroup competition is normative (haas & park. 2010). in part due to the
activity tor academics. sécona, the geograpnic proximity or scientists may nave

facilitated scheduled or serendipitous encounters with greater ease (catalit
2018). third, our focus on the life sciences also draws upon a specific population,
where intragroup competition is normative (haas & park, 2010), in part due to the
“winner-takes-all” model of rewards and recognition (stephan, 1996). we
recognize that other settings may feature greater geographic dispersion or
promote more openness and cooperation; a promising future direction would be
to extend this research to different settings.

  

  

 

we also focused most heavily on archival data (e.g., public trace data from
publications) to examine long-term knowledge production outcomes, which
provided greater insights into the scientists’ behaviors rather than the reasons
behind the observed patterns. although we made efforts to qualify these findings
by examining the content of the knowledge transfer, publications, and citations,
future research can seek to supplement archival data with alternative methods
(eg., surveys, interviews) that continue to track the scientists’ interaction
patterns, as well as the invisible track of “failed” knowledge production. such
complementary data sources will ultimately provide deeper insights on how
engineered serendipitous encounters between people can be cultivated into
productive relationships over time. this future work would facilitate a deeper
performative assessment of how knowledge sharing can be “serendipitously
engineered’ to shape the quality of knowledge outcomes.

overall, this study takes a critical step towards identifying the processes that
performative assessment of how knowledge sharing can be “serendipitously

engineered’ to shape the quality of knowledge outcomes.

overall, this study takes a critical step towards identifying the processes that
explain when serendipitous encounters shape knowledge production outcomes
among innovating individuals. we show that brief, information-rich interactions
between people with some overlapping knowledge interests can have a
productive effect on knowledge transfer, creation and diffusion.

hypotheses (h3a) and (h3b) predict that knowledge sharing partners are less
likely to diffuse knowledge as their field and intellectual similarity increase,
respectively. models 3 and 4 show that increasing field similarity reduced
knowledge diffusion among same room pairs (low: 0.366, p = .024; moderate:
1.003, p = .098) and communicating pairs (low: 2.823, p = .033; moderate: 6.603, p
.050). models 5 and 6 show that there is no evidence that high intellectual
similarity lowered knowledge diffusion among same room (low: -0.0487, p = .739;
moderate: -0.003, p = .986) or communicating pairs (low: -0.426, p = .712;
moderate: -0.091, p = .936). the results are consistent in models 7 and 8, which
include both knowledge similarity interaction terms.

 

 

figure 3c plots the change in knowledge diffusion (forward citations) between

include both knowledge similarity interaction terms.

figure 3c plots the change in knowledge diffusion (forward citations) between
communicating and noncommunicating pairs from model 4, with 95% cls. we
observe that while communication did alter forward citation trends for pairs with
low field overlap, and led to a small increase of 3.521 [-1.465, 8.508] citations for
pairs with moderate field overlap, we observe a large decrease from 0.874 [0.347,
1.402] to -2.207 [-4.326, -0.088] for same field pairs, corresponding to a
reduction of about 3.082 citations per pair.

to generate greater insight into the types of publications being cited among the
low and moderate field overlap pairs, we compared the publication titles of cited
papers for pairs assigned to the same versus different rooms. we observe that
the same room pairs were more likely to cite papers using advanced imaging
technologies (e.g., sample paper titles included: “massively parallel mri detector
arrays”; “an fmri study of facial emotion processing patients with schizophrenia’).
overall, there was a greater use of advanced imaging technologies in the
publication titles of same room pairs: 42.6% for same room pairs versus 31.3%
for different room pairs (t= 2.406, p =.017). ° this suggests that the knowledge
sharing intervention enabled pairs from different fields to learn about “outside”
work, which they subsequently integrated into their own future research. in
contrast, the knowledge sharing intervention may have led to a crowding out

sharing intervention enabled pairs from different fields to learn about “outside”
work, which they subsequently integrated into their own future research. in
contrast, the knowledge sharing intervention may have led to a crowding out
effect among highly similar pairs. in summary, we find evidence for competitive
effects of field similarity on knowledge diffusion, which confirms hypothesis
(h3a).

models 3 and 4 show that compared to same field pairs, moderate field similarity
has a strong positive relationship with knowledge creation among same room
pairs (0.329, p = .047) and communicating pairs (2.159, p = .036). there is also a
smaller, positive association between low field similarity and knowledge creation
among same room pairs (0.133, p = .092) and communicating pairs (1.040, p =
-101). turning to intellectual similarity, models 5 and 6 show there is no
meaningful association between moderate intellectual similarity and knowledge

(0.333, p= .234). the results are consistent in models 7 and 8, which includes both

communication did not meaningfully benefit pairs with low field overlap,
communication led to an increase of 1.174 [-0.207, 2.556] copublications among
pairs with moderate field overlap, and -0.984 [-1.731, -0.237] fewer
copublications among pairs with high field overlap. the patterns suggest that

communication reduced the search costs of identifying synergistic collaborations
with scientists sharing some field interests, resulting in a reallocation of resources
away from pairs with high field overlap.

we also examined the extent that the knowledge sharing intervention impacted
the scientists’ overall research portfolios. turning to the scientists’
postsymposium publications, each scientist had an average of m = 32.394 (sd =
35.412) peer-reviewed research articles; the increase of 1.174 publications among
pairs with moderate field overlap corresponds to about 7% of a scientist's,
publications, which is of considerable magnitude from a 90 min intervention.
turning to changes in research direction, we also note that same room pairs were
more likely to publish in advanced imaging journals (e.g., magnetic resonance in
medicine, nmr in biomedicine): 21% for same room versus 6% for different room
pairs (t= 2.302, p =.0249). ° this suggests that the knowledge sharing treatment
not only reduced search costs of finding collaborators but also potentially
reshaped the pairs’ research trajectories.

remain consistent in model 11, which includes both interaction terms. this
suggests that although strong field overlap is a catalyzing force for initiating early-

these ties persist into copublications. thus, our results show support for

shortly after the symposia, all participants received an e-mail invitation to submit
applications for the pilot grants or concept awards by the deadline of march 8,
2012. at this time, they also received pdf booklets with the contact information
and posters of all participants so that all researchers had identical information
apart from the knowledge acquired in the breakout rooms.

3.3 data collection and variables

we tested our hypotheses using data from a variety of resources from the
advanced imaging symposium and the 6 years of publication records from 2013
to 2018 on the attendees. in the analyses, we did not include the year 2012 to.
remove potential research topics or ideas that were in progress prior to the
symposium. we used data from the scientists’ registration form for the

remove potential research topics or ideas that were in progress prior to the
symposium. we used data from the scientists’ registration form for the
symposium, which contained information about their institution, department,
academic position, self-identity as an imager or clinician, and statements of
interest. the sociometric badges automatically recorded their face-to-face
encounters when two badges were facing each other with a direct line of sight
within a 30° cone of 1 m. we verified that all recorded interactions were within 10
m using bluetooth proximity data (kim et al., 2012) and required that two badges
be in contact with each other over a span of at least 1 min (ingram & mortis,
2007). we collected face-to-face interaction data for 306 (74%) scientists who
attended the symposium, and the subsequent analyses are based on these
scientists. * after the symposium, we collected information on the coapplicants
and the awardees of the advanced imaging grants and used the scopus database
to collect scientists’ publication records.

3.3.1 dependent variables

knowledge transfer

we base our knowledge transfer measure on the mesh lexicon. in the life
sciences, the u.s. national library of medicine (nlm) uses a controlled mesh
taxonomy of keywords to index biomedical and health-related information for
articles appearing in medline/pubmed, the nlm catalog, and other nlm
databases. each article is associated with a set of mesh keywords that describe

taxonomy of keywords to index biomedical and health-related information for
articles appearing in medline/pubmed, the nlm catalog, and other nlm
databases. each article is associated with a set of mesh keywords that describe
the content of the citation. mesh keywords are assigned by professional science
librarians and computer algorithms to ensure global and consistent assignment
of keywords across the life sciences (coletti & bleich, 2001). we extracted the
unique mesh keywords associated with each scientist's publications to create two
vectors of mesh keywords: the first with all mesh keywords prior to the advanced
imaging symposium (i.e., pre-2012), and the second with all mesh keywords after
the symposium (i.e., 2013-2018). for each scientist-pair {i}, we then counted the
number of mesh terms that j transferred to /and the number of mesh terms that
transferred to j by taking the intersection of mesh keywords between /'s pre-
2012 vector and j's post-2012 vector and between j's pre-2012 vector and /’s post-
2012 vector, excluding any mesh terms that were common to both i and jin their
pre-2012 mesh vectors. our resulting knowledge transfer measure, mesh
keyword transfer is the count of “transferred” mesh keywords between pair {i,),
normalized by the total number of mesh keywords in scientists / and j's post-2012
mesh vectors, expressed as a percentage. the resulting measure ranges from 0
to 100% to and is interpreted as the percentage of postsymposium mesh
keywords that were transferred between scientist-pair {i}, with 0% representing
no transferred mesh keywords and 100% representing complete transfer.

 

knowledge creation
keywords that were transterred between scientist-pair {i}, with 0% representing
no transferred mesh keywords and 100% representing complete transfer.

knowledge creation

we measure knowledge creation as the postsymposium (2013-2018) count of
copublications between scientist-pair {i,} in peer-reviewed journals, conference
proceedings, and book chapters.

knowledge diffusion

we measure knowledge diffusion as the postsymposium (2013-2018) count of
noncoauthored forward citations between scientist-pair {i,} in peer-reviewed
journals, conference proceedings, and book chapters.

3.3.2 independent variables

knowledge sharing

we use two alternative variables to capture knowledge sharing. first, we use the
dummy variable, same room, to measure whether scientist-pair {i, j} was
randomly assigned to the same room (treatment pairs) or different breakout
rooms (control pairs). second, we use the dummy variable, f2f (face-to-face)
communication to measure whether scientist-pair {i, j} engaged in least 1 min of
interaction, recorded using sociometric badges.

 

   

communication to measure whether scientist-pair {i, j} engaged in least 1 min of
interaction, recorded using sociometric badges.

 

knowledge similarity

knowledge similarity is comprised of field and intellectual similarity. we measure
field similarity using clinical areas (third-party coded from the scientists’
statements of interest), which pertain to the primary area of responsibility for
“bedside” patient care. there were a total of 24 unique clinical areas (e.g.,
oncology, neurology, immunology), and some statements of interests (4.24%)
spanned two clinical areas, such as neurology/endocrinology. we then use a
categorical variable to indicate whether scientist-pair {/, j} shared low, moderate or
high field similarity depending on whether their clinical areas shared no (85.5%),
partial (1.9%), or complete (12.6%) overlap, respectively.

we measure intellectual similarity using the count of common mesh keywords
shared by scientist-pair {i, } prior to 2012 and dichotomize the distribution into
three equal-sized groups, to indicate whether scientist-pair {i, } had low,
moderate, or a high number of common mesh keywords prior to the 2012
symposium. low intellectual similarity corresponds to 0-2 common keywords,
moderate intellectual similarity corresponds to 3-11 common keywords, and high
intellectual similarity corresponds to more than 11 common keywords.

elemental collaboration
moderate intellectual similarity corresponds to 3-11 common keywords, and high
intellectual similarity corresponds to more than 11 common keywords.

elemental collaboration

we use grant coapplicant to measure an elemental collaboration, which captured
whether scientist-pair {i, } coapplied on the grant following the symposium.

3.3.3 other variables

the analysis strategy relies most critically on the research design's randomization.
we use dummy variables for each symposium night and room (i.e., fixed effects)
to control for unobserved night and room characteristics. to test hypotheses
(h2c) and (h2d), we use the dummy variable, grant awardee to capture whether
scientist-pair {i} included a grant recipient. among the 306 scientists, 13 pilot
grant proposals were awarded funding, comprising 6.54% of pairs with grant
awardees.

3.4 estimation approach

we wish to estimate the effects of field and intellectual similarity between
knowledge sharing partners on knowledge production outcomes. the unit of
analysis is the scientist-pair(i,}, and pairs are considered to be “at risk” if they
attended the same night of the symposium—a total of 15,817 pairs. first, we
analyze the effect of being in the same (treatment) versus different (control)

  

analysis is the scientist-pair(i,}, and pairs are considered to be “at risk” if they
attended the same night of the symposium—a total of 15,817 pairs. first, we
analyze the effect of being in the same (treatment) versus different (control)
breakout rooms on knowledge production outcomes using ordinary least squares
(ols) regression. we then interact same room with field similarity, and same room
with intellectual similarity to examine knowledge similarity effects. second, we
analyze the effect of face-to-face communication on knowledge production
outcomes using instrumental variable (iv) regression. we use an iv approach to
account for the common endogeneity issue in pairwise interaction data. we
exploit exogenous variation in the likelihood of interaction between scientists
who are assigned to the same versus different breakout rooms by using same
room as an instrument for f2f communication in the first stage, and the estimates
for f2f communication in the second stage. we then interact f2f communication
with field similarity, and f2f communication with intellectual similarity to examine
knowledge similarity effects.

 

 

we address the nonindependence, common-person problem of dyadic
regressions by estimating robust ses that are simultaneously clustered on both
members of the dyad, using multiway clustering, developed theoretically by
cameron, gelbach, and miller (2011) and implemented for stata in clus_nway.ado
(kleinbaum et al., 2013).

2.2 two knowledge bases of similarity: field specialty and
intellectual specialty

field specialties are developed through an individual's educational background,
skills and training (bechky, 2011; bourdieu, 1984; haas & park, 2010). in
biomedical research, which is our focal context of study, there are multiple

skills and training (bechky, 2011; bourdieu, 1984; haas & park, 2010). in
biomedical research, which is our focal context of study, there are multiple
medical field specialties, such as neurology, radiology or oncology that focus on
investigations of the biological process and the causes of specific diseases.
organizations often structure their departmental and divisional memberships
around field specialties (biancani et al., 2014). in universities and academia, this
means that field specialties are often the primary channels through which
resources, such as salaries, funding, tenure, offices and laboratory space, are
apportioned to faculty (biancani, dahlander, mcfarland, & smith, 2018). for these
reasons, field specialties provide professional reference groups (haas & park,
2010) for members to identify appropriate behavior, rigor of scholarship, career
goals and aspirations (abbott, 2001). in contrast, intellectual specialties are closely
aligned to personal interests and passions that evolve over time. individuals can
have memberships in multiple intellectual specialties depending on their current
pursuits and priorities (caza et al., 2018). for example, in biomedical research,
intellectual specialties include research topics such as aging, addictions,
alzheimer's disease, brain injury, sleep, and stem cells; each of these intellectual
specialties is associated with memberships in professional reference groups
(haas & park, 2010) for people motivated by common problems, methods, trends,
and processes. these intellectual interests can be specific to a field's research
topics, such as alzheimer's disease, which is typically studied by neurologists, or
span different fields, such as stem cell research.

       
   

            

 

and processes. these intellectual interests can be specific to a field's research
topics, such as alzheimer's disease, which is typically studied by neurologists, or
span different fields, such as stem cell research.

in short, field and intellectual specialties shape people's identities, language,
tastes and affiliations through professional memberships (haas & park, 2010).
individuals will likely adopt multiple professional identities depending on their
field and intellectual memberships: this means that people from different field
specialties can share overlapping intellectual interests, while individuals from the
same field specialty can have divergent intellectual interests, because field and
intellectual interests are two distinct dimensions of individuals’ knowledge
constructs.

in distinguishing how field and intellectual overlap shape knowledge production,
knowledge similarity describes the distance between the field specialties and
intellectual specialties of two knowledge sharing partners. individuals are more
likely to recognize and absorb new ideas when they already have some existing
expertise and find it more difficult when the ideas are outside their realm of
expertise (carlile, 2004; cohen & levinthal, 1990). put differently, even though
distant knowledge tends to be novel and valuable (jeppesen & lakhani, 2010;
leahey et al., 2017), people are more likely to experience challenges
communicating with one another, and may not recognize the value of external
information (cohen & levinthal, 1990; grant, 1996). for example, two

leahey et al., 2017), people are more likely to experience challenges
communicating with one another, and may not recognize the value of external
information (cohen & levinthal, 1990; grant, 1996). for example, two
neurologists are less likely to experience challenges communicating with each
other than a neurologist and oncologist pair because they share more similar
educational backgrounds, training and clinical expertise. however, there may be
greater opportunities for knowledge production between the neurologist and
oncologist pair because their field specialties are more distant. similarly, although
two sleep researchers may communicate and comprehend each other with
relative ease because they read and conduct similar research (dahlander &
mcfarland, 2013), there is greater potential for knowledge production between an
aging and a sleep researcher, who may offer greater utility and value to one
another to solve problems related to both sleep and aging processes—provided
that they have sufficient common knowledge (bechky, 2011; grant, 1996). this
suggests that there is an inherent trade-off between the greater ease of
conversing and absorbing ideas locally from individuals with many overlapping
interests and the greater potential opportunities for novel ideas and knowledge
transfer, creation, and diffusion from sharing and assessing the knowledge of
those with more distant interests.

2.3 knowledge transfer and knowledge similarity

knowledge transfer is a two-sided process because it depends on the efforts of a
source to share knowledge with a recipient and the recipient's efforts and
capacity to acquire, absorb, and learn it (argote, 2012). because of greater
common knowledge, local knowledge found within groups of similar individuals
tends to be more easily transferred than distant knowledge spanning group
boundaries (carlile, 2004; kogut & zander, 1992; rosenkopf & almeida, 2003).
that said, more distant knowledge may present nonredundant ideas that benefit
learning and acquiring new concepts. consequently, during serendipitous idea
exchanges, we would expect that partners from dissimilar field and intellectual
specialties offer each other more novel ideas and opportunities to learn (leahey
et al,, 2017; lee, 2019). divergent interests create a wider pool of knowledge to
draw upon, which allows for multiple perspectives and problem-solving
approaches that increase the likelihood of new discoveries (boudreau, guinan,
lakhani, & riedl, 2016)—provided that the partners share sufficient common
knowledge to make sense of each other's knowledge dissimilarities. based on
these reasons, we expect that pairs with less field or intellectual overlap have a
greater potential pool of ideas for knowledge transfer, up until a threshold of
dissimilarity, after which they will lack sufficient common interests to benefit from
knowledge transfer.

hypothesis (h1b). intellectual similarity has an inverted u-shaped effect on the

2.4 knowledge creation and knowledge similarity

there is a growing view among innovation scholars that specialization has created
a "knowledge burden” hypothesis that makes collaborative work combining the
increasingly narrow niches of specialization imperative to moving the knowledge
frontier forward (jones, 2009; uzzi et al., 2013). scientific discovery is a process
that combines individually focused tasks—such as reading, experimentation, and
writing—with social interactions through joint sense-making with others that can
spark new discoveries (boudreau et al., 2016; latour & woolgar, 2013).

that said, collaborations tend to be constrained by social processes, such as
preferences for others with shared attributes, as well as search costs that stifle
attempts to identify suitable collaborators. first, principles of homophily suggest
that people are attracted to others who hold similar values because their
interactions are more rewarding and less uncertain (mcpherson & smith-lovin,
1987), as a result of the benefits of security and mutual attraction (dahlander &

acer pes co tosttay sura ie congdotagot ss rit st; phimciples- ut homtopry subeest
that people are attracted to others who hold similar values because their
interactions are more rewarding and less uncertain (mcpherson & smith-lovin,
1987), as a result of the benefits of security and mutual attraction (dahlander &
mcfarland, 2013). moreover, joint knowledge creation is a long-term investment
in a multiplex relationship (uzzi, 1997), where partners engage in joint problem-
solving and spend time together discussing, reflecting and interacting to achieve
mutual benefit (mcfadyen & cannella jr, 2004). due to these reasons,
collaborations are more likely to form among individuals who share overlapping
field and intellectual interests (biancani et al., 2014; dahlander & mcfarland,
2013).

 

 

second, there is a growing view that search costs and resulting information
frictions tend to constrain people's collaboration patterns (boudreau et al., 2017;
catalini, 2018). engineered, serendipitous interactions can mitigate some of these
frictions by providing people the opportunity to exchange information and
develop intellectual links with others they would not otherwise interact with. such
interactions may enable diverse partners to discover the potential
complementarities they offer each other, leading to new collaborations. however,
to the extent that serendipitous knowledge sharing leads to joint knowledge
creation will also likely require that potential partners share some field or
intellectual overlap; otherwise their interests may be too disparate to establish
synergies in incentives (e.g., publication or tenure requirements) or research

interests. accordingly. we exnect that increasing field and intellectual similarity
creation will aiso likely require that potential partners snare some tield or

intellectual overlap; otherwise their interests may be too disparate to establish
synergies in incentives (e.g., publication or tenure requirements) or research
interests. accordingly, we expect that increasing field and intellectual similarity
should benefit knowledge creation up to a threshold, over which there are
decreasing marginal returns on greater levels of knowledge similarity.

hypothesis (h2a). field similarity has an inverted u-shaped effect on the relationship
between knowledge sharing and knowledge creation.

hypothesis (h2b). intellectual similarity has an inverted u-shaped effect on the
relationship between knowledge sharing and knowledge creation.

another pathway that may lead to joint knowledge creation relies on prior
collaborations and tie persistence (hasan & koning, 2019; ingram & morris, 2007;
zhang & guler, 2020). we examine a specific type of tie persistence, namely the
likelihood that an elemental collaboration persists into a complete knowledge
product. in science, grant coapplications and copublications represent two
essential but opposing ends of knowledge creation, from idea-generation to final
output (mcfadyen & cannella jr, 2004). both are also essential to scientists’
research productivity and often used as evaluative criteria for important
decisions, such as promotion, tenure, awards and recognition (dahlander &
mcfarland, 2013; stephan, 1996). the knowledge similarity requirements that
improve the likelihood that elemental collaborations persist into copublications

decisions, such as promotion, tenure, awards and recognition (dahlander &
mcfarland, 2013; stephan, 1996). the knowledge similarity requirements that
improve the likelihood that elemental collaborations persist into copublications
may differ from the processes that shape long-term collaborations on peer-
reviewed research publications. in addition to being at the open end of research
inquiry, grant applications tend to have finite submission deadlines and these can
impose resource, attention, coordination and other constraints on potential
partners (dahlander, o'mahony, & gann, 2016). although serendipitous
knowledge exchanges can reduce information search costs and expose people to
promising new contacts, multiplex relationships require repeated interactions
(ingram & morris, 2007). in the short-term, potential partners may turn to other
individuals with whom they share significant knowledge overlap, due to fewer
frictions and relational uncertainties (e.g., priorities, personalities, scheduling
constraints) associated with similar partners. due to these reasons, common
knowledge may be even more critical to shaping elemental collaborations. we
thereby expect that elemental collaborations are more likely to persist into a final
product of knowledge creation when knowledge sharing partners have significant
knowledge overlap in terms of their field and intellectual interests.

 

hypothesis (h2c). an elemental collaboration is more likely to result in knowledge
creation as the field similarity between two individuals increases.

hypothesis (h2d). an elemental collaboration is more likely to result in knowledge
ope
creation as the field similarity between two individuals increases.

hypothesis (h2d). an elemental collaboration is more likely to result in knowledge

2.5 knowledge diffusion and knowledge similarity

among research scientists, forward citations to others’ publications are a primary
means for diffusing knowledge. beyond knowledge diffusion, forward citations
constitute a critical means of social recognition for acknowledging the
contributions of predecessors (merton, 1973) and tracing the path of scientific
discovery and diffusion (stephan, 1996). some scholars argue that the number of
citations a publication has received is perhaps the most common way to measure
the importance of an individual's contribution to science (stephan, 1996).
consistent with this view, citations are a critical currency of scientific credit
(latour & woolgar, 2013), both driving research impact and constituting the basis
of reward systems in science, including promotion, status, funding, peer esteem,
honors, and awards (boudreau & lakhani, 2015).

there are generally two views of how knowledge is diffused in science: openness
and secrecy. according to the mertonian norms of communalism or “openness,”
publication enables scientists to establish priority of discovery and allows them to
be the first to communicate an advance in knowledge and allow others to freely

hice it (martan 1072) thc nithlicatinn nramoatac tha anan diffiician af criantifie

and secrecy. according to the mertonian norms of communalism or “openness,”
publication enables scientists to establish priority of discovery and allows them to
be the first to communicate an advance in knowledge and allow others to freely
use it (merton, 1973). thus, publication promotes the open diffusion of scientific
knowledge, as long as scientists’ own internal agents (i.e., other scientists)
appropriately recognize and diffuse their work (boudreau & lakhani, 2015). on
the other hand, social recognition is a discretionary act among scientists, and
strong evidence points to the existence of counter-norms promoting secrecy,
competition, and information withholding (haas & park, 2010; haeussler, jiang,
thursby, & thursby, 2014). scientists often compete for similar resources,
funding, and recognition. given limited resources, scientists need to be assured
that they will be appropriately remunerated for openly diffusing others’
knowledge (hagstrom, 1974; murray & o'mahony, 2007; reschke, azoulay, &
stuart, 2018).

on balance, the evidence suggests that scientists do not unequivocally diffuse
each other's publications. among scientists with greater knowledge overlap,
serendipitous idea sharing may heighten the competition effect, particularly as
information exchange can introduce people to novel work they cannot discover
on their own via publications or other publicly available sources. these new
projects may be similar to their own undertakings, risking duplication of efforts.
because scientists compete for priority (merton, 1973), recognition (hagstrom,
1974; reskin, 1977), and funding (stephan, 1996), partners with highly

projects may be similar to their own undertakings, risking duplication of efforts.
because scientists compete for priority (merton, 1973), recognition (hagstrom,
1974; reskin, 1977), and funding (stephan, 1996), partners with highly
overlapping interests may discover a need to differentiate themselves from one
another. social recognition of highly similar peers would not only highlight
redundancies but may also detract attention and resources away from one's own
work (campanario & acedo, 2007). we expect that partners sharing high field or
intellectual similarity may refrain from citing each other's research to outperform
their peers.

hypothesis (h3a). knowledge sharing is less likely to lead to knowledge diffusion as
the field similarity between individuals increases.

hypothesis (h3b). knowledge sharing is less likely to lead to knowledge diffusion as
the intellectual similarity between individuals increases.

3 experimental methods

in an ideal setting, all of the prior interactions and efforts that go into knowledge
production would be fully observable to scholars to theorize and validate through
empirical observations. the reality, however, is that the vast majority of prior
scholarly work concerned with how knowledge is produced has primarily focused
on observed outcomes—e.g., papers, funding, patents, citations, team structure,

and so forth—to draw inferences ahaut the mechanisms tinderlving the
empirical observations. ihe reality, however, is that the vast majority of prior

scholarly work concerned with how knowledge is produced has primarily focused
on observed outcomes—e.g., papers, funding, patents, citations, team structure,
and so forth—to draw inferences about the mechanisms underlying the
knowledge production process (dahlander & mcfarland, 2013; fleming et al.,
2007; staw & epstein, 2000). for example, research on scientists will include the
papers they publish, the collaborators they have worked with, and the knowledge
that they have developed and have diffused through citations. however, a
concern with relying on published trace data is that it masks all of the work and
activities that occurred prior to knowledge production, such as the entire risk set
of alters an individual may have interacted with prior to settling on a particular
team. the empirical shortcomings of not being able to directly observe
knowledge sharing and the drivers of knowledge production may insert biases in
our inferences, such as self-selection and survivor bias. some work aims to
address these concerns by extending the risk set to unsuccessful collaborations
(e.g., non-awarded grant applications) to examine quality-adjusted research
output of published (i.e., visible) trace data (arora & gambardella, 2005; ayoubi,
pezzonii, & visentin, 2019; ganguli, 2017). that said, unobserved heterogeneity
between the two groups remains a persistent challenge.

a feasible alternative is to design a field experiment that enables the capture of
data around interactions between scientists and overcomes concerns around
endogeneity of affiliation, team formation, and knowledge exposure by

a feasible alternative is to design a field experiment that enables the capture of
data around interactions between scientists and overcomes concerns around
endogeneity of affiliation, team formation, and knowledge exposure by
randomizing the encounters that the scientists have with each other. the benefit
of this approach is that it can provide causal explanations about the factors that
impact knowledge production, weighed against the challenges of drawing
inferences with smaller sample sizes in an experiment as opposed to relying on
all observed data of many more scientists.

  
   

 

 

 

3.1 setting and research design

we carried out our study in the context of a medical symposium for research on
advanced imaging, which is used to detect diseases and other health conditions
early, to allow health care practitioners to direct patients to the health care
services that they need. we collaborated with the administrators of a large u.s.
medical school to layer the medical symposium onto the university’s clinical and
translational science center pilot grant program, which provides seed funding in
the form of pilot grants to support nascent research efforts that are awarded
competitively to faculty within the university. ' the purpose of the grant
opportunity was to solicit proposals to improve methods for using advanced
imaging technologies to address unmet clinical needs, and offered $50,000 per
award for up to 15 pilot grants. a major challenge in the field of advanced
imaging is that furthering the knowledge frontier requires expertise in the latest

  

 

    

 

 

imaging technologies to address unmet clinical needs, and offered $50,000 per
award for up to 15 pilot grants. a major challenge in the field of advanced
imaging is that furthering the knowledge frontier requires expertise in the latest
imaging tools and technologies and a deep understanding of the health problems
to which they could be applied. these different types of knowledge are typically
held by people from distinct disciplinary backgrounds, which makes advanced
imaging an ideal setting for our research.

  

 

 

in november 2011, we invited all life sciences faculty and researchers at the
university to a medical research symposium for the unique grant funding
opportunity. our field experiment involved faculty and researchers at the
university and its affiliated hospitals and institutions, which are independently
owned and managed, with each appearing as a separate entity in hospital
rankings and lists of national institutes of health (nih) grant recipients. we
communicated to applicants that eligibility to submit a grant application was
conditional on attending the symposium. in the first stage, investigators
interested in applying for the grants submitted a statement of interest in which
they briefly described a specific medical problem that advanced imaging
techniques could potentially address. we collected basic biographical information
(eg., degree, institution, department appointment) at this stage.

the symposia were held on january 31, february 1, and february 2, 2012, at one
of the university's innovation labs. figure 1 summarizes the key details of the
randomization: 402 unique participants were randomly assigned to one of three
nights of the symposium, one of four breakout rooms, one of two groups, as well
as a poster location to stand next to around the perimeter of the room.
participants were provided an electronic device, called a “sociometric badge” to
automatically record their face-to-face interactions during the symposium (kim et
al., 2012). each of the three nights featured a 30-min welcome address, followed
by two 45-min poster sessions in breakout rooms, with a 15-min social break in
between the poster sessions. within each breakout room, scientists were
randomly assigned to a poster location and either the first or second poster
group. the scientists presented and exchanged ideas with one another during the
poster sessions. the grant administrators prepared the posters to be a standard
size and in a standard format, based on each participant's statements of interest.
thus, treatment pairs assigned to the same breakout rooms had more
opportunities for knowledge sharing than control pairs.

1 introduction

in 2013, cell biologist william earnshaw of the university of edinburgh happened
to attend the same academic conference as systems biologist job dekker of the
university of massachusetts medical school and computational biologist leonid
mirny from the massachusetts institute of technology. by chance, earnshaw
attended a presentation by dekker and mirny about their joint work on mitotic
chromosomes, during which he became convinced that his lab could provide
bench methods to improve dekker and mirny's computational models. earnshaw
approached dekker and mirny after the talk; their conversation evolved into a
three-lab collaboration and a 2018 publication in science (pain, 2018).

this anecdotal example suggests that serendipitous encounters can play a role in
innovation, perhaps by exposing individuals to people that they would not
otherwise have a chance to meet, and to unfamiliar sources of information that
can be combined with their own knowledge stock and lead to new discoveries
(fleming, mingo, & chen, 2007; uzzi, mukherjee, stringer, & jones, 2013).
however, the likelihood that serendipitous encounters lead to successful
knowledge production remains poorly understood often because the process is
uncertain, complex and relatively understudied. in particular, even if an
encounter eventually produces new knowledge, this process may occur slowly
and only emerge after a number of years (catalini, 2018; fleming, 2001). a

encounter eventually produces new knowledge, this process may occur slowly
and only emerge after a number of years (catalini, 2018; fleming, 2001). a
significant degree of knowledge within organizations is tacit and is not easily
transferred (hansen, 1999; nonaka, 1994). knowledge creation via new
collaborations can be costly (boudreau et al., 2017; dahlander & mcfarland,
2013), requiring coordinated effort, alignment of incentives, establishment of
trust, generation of creative synergy, and “matching” criteria, such as personality
and scheduling compatibility (azoulay, ding, & stuart, 2007; catalini, 2018). even if
knowledge transfer or creation is successful, knowledge tends to diffuse slowly
through interpersonal networks (fleming et al., 2007; singh, 2005). the question
thus arises of when serendipitous encounters are more likely to facilitate useful
idea exchange and knowledge production. previous literature tends to focus on
the factors that may increase the amount or intensity of short-term
communication and interaction between individuals, rather than the implications
of serendipitous encounters on knowledge production (allen, 1977; kleinbaum,
stuart, & tushman, 2013). given that geographic proximity increases the
likelihood of serendipitous encounters (catalini, 2018), recent research has begun
to examine the effects of organizational redesign on knowledge production
(catalini, 2018; fang, lee, & schilling, 2010; lee, 2019). although it is possible that
organizational redesign and greater geographic proximity between individuals
can increase knowledge production, most studies do not directly address how
knowledge sharing between two individuals affects the path-dependent nature of

 

organizational redesign and greater geographic proximity between individuals
can increase knowledge production, most studies do not directly address how
knowledge sharing between two individuals affects the path-dependent nature of
the knowledge production process.

since prior work tends to focus on a single knowledge production outcome
(phelps, heidl, & wadhwa, 2012), often on the factors that impede knowledge
transfer (carlile, 2004; hansen, 1999; szulanski, 1996; uzzi, 1997), it is unclear how
knowledge sharing may also affect knowledge creation and diffusion. hence, we
know relatively little about whether serendipitous encounters actually lead to
meaningful idea exchange that can be applied to one’s own tasks, or whether
these interactions can spark new collaborations and broader diffusion of ideas
over time. the goal of our work is to address this gap in literature by examining to
what extent a systematic relationship exists between serendipitous encounters
and knowledge production outcomes.

we posit that an effective encounter hinges not just on the serendipity of the
interaction but also on the existence of common knowledge that individuals use
to make sense of each other's specialized knowledge and connect it to what they
already know. common knowledge enhances the ability for new knowledge to be
assimilated into the concepts, objects and patterns that are already present in
people's cognitive structures (bower & hilgard, 1981; cohen & levinthal, 1990).
when new information is related to prior knowledge constructs, itis more readily

  

assimilated into the concepts, objects and patterns ‘that are already present in
people's cognitive structures (bower & hilgard, 1981; cohen & levinthal, 1990).
when new information is related to prior knowledge constructs, it is more readily
absorbed, integrated, and applied in new settings (carlile, 2004; kogut & zander,
1992) without sufficient prior knowledge, individuals may have difficulty
integrating new knowledge (rosenkopf & almeida, 2003). in this article, we argue
that there are two essential characteristics to people's common knowledge: field
similarity in their educational backgrounds and training, and intellectual similarity
in their interests, passions and pursuits. serendipitous encounters are more likely
to be effective when people share some knowledge similarity in both their field
and intellectual interests.

to systematically investigate the relationships between serendipitous encounters
and knowledge production requires a rich longitudinal dataset that directly
observes exogenous face-to-face knowledge sharing between two individuals and
subsequent knowledge production outcomes. to draw causal inferences, we
designed and executed a field experiment at a research symposium on advanced
imaging in early 2012 at a leading academic medical center. we chose this setting
due to the centrality of knowledge production to their organizational and
individual performance goals and the prevalence of knowledge sharing norms
(dahlander & mcfarland, 2013). we created exogenous variation in opportunities
for information-rich, face-to-face encounters between cross-disciplinary scientists
interested in applying for an internal grant program promoting the development

(dahlander & mcfarland, 2013). we created exogenous variation in opportunities,
for information-rich, face-to-face encounters between cross-disciplinary scientists
interested in applying for an internal grant program promoting the development
of advanced imaging solutions to address an unmet clinical need. using electronic
sociometric badges (kim, mcfee, olguin, waber, & pentland, 2012), we collected a
unique dataset of fine-grained, live interactions between pairs of scientists who
were randomly assigned to be in the same symposium room for knowledge
sharing. we then combined this with a rich longitudinal dataset on long-run
knowledge production outcomes from the scientists’ written publications over a
six-year period, where we linked scientists’ pairwise keywords, collaborations and
forward citations to examine the extent that the encounters led to knowledge
transfer, creation and diffusion, respectively. this design enabled us to causally
and systematically identify the relationships between knowledge sharing and
knowledge production to explain why some serendipitous encounters resulted in
knowledge production while others did not.

 

 

we find both cooperative and competitive effects of serendipitous knowledge
sharing encounters on knowledge production. on the one hand, knowledge
sharing led to greater knowledge transfer and knowledge creation when people
had some overlapping intellectual and field interests, respectively. although
knowledge sharing had limited impact on knowledge transfer among pairs with
either few or many overlapping interests, we observe a twofold increase in
knowledge transfer (of medical subject headings or mesh keywords) for

knowledge sharing had limited impact on knowledge transfer among pairs with
either few or many overlapping interests, we observe a twofold increase in
knowledge transfer (of medical subject headings or mesh keywords) for
moderately similar pairs, suggesting an inverted u-shaped relationship between
knowledge overlap and knowledge transfer. similarly, we find that knowledge
sharing between pairs with some common interests led to 1.2 more coauthored
peer-reviewed publications, compared to a 0.98 decrease in copublications
among pairs in the same field, which suggests that the knowledge sharing
intervention reduced the search costs associated with forming synergistic
collaborations. by comparing the knowledge drivers of near-term collaborations
and long-term collaborations, we find that common knowledge is more critical for
the former. on the other hand, knowledge sharing reduces knowledge diffusion
between people from the same field, with interacting pairs citing each other
between 2.8 and 6.7 times less than noninteracting pairs from more distant
fields.

we aim to make several contributions to the literature. first, we contribute to the
literature on search costs and information frictions associated with the
knowledge production process (agrawal & goldfarb, 2008; boudreau et al., 2017;
catalini, 2018; hansen, 1999; hansen & haas, 2001), by focusing on the extent
that “engineered serendipity” can mitigate some of these costs. we emphasize
the role of knowledge similarity in shaping different components of knowledge

that “engineered serendipity” can mitigate some of these costs. we emphasize
the role of knowledge similarity in shaping different components of knowledge
production, and over different time horizons. most prior research has
predominantly focused on one component or a single time frame (adams, black,
clemmons, & stephan, 2005; boudreau et al., 2017; dahlander & mcfarland,
2013; szulanski, 1996). this work is unique because it extends the findings from
boudreau et al. (2017) on search costs and short-term collaborations using the
same field experiment, to show how engineered serendipity may alter the role of
knowledge similarity in knowledge production over time. our findings suggest
that the magnitude of these frictions is likely to be more difficult to overcome in
the short-run compared to the long-run.

second, we make contributions to the literature on temporary colocation, and the
value of conferences, symposia and similar events on the direction of inventive
activity on the knowledge frontier and the emergent patterns of collaborative
activity (biancani, mcfarland, & dahlander, 2014; boudreau et al., 2017; campos,
leon, & mcquillin, 2018; catalini, fons-rosen, & gaulé, 2020; chai & freeman,
2019). prior research has been limited in its ability to observe actual acts of
knowledge sharing between pairs, and its implications on knowledge production.
our study indicates that even brief, information-rich encounters at conferences
can benefit knowledge production, with the potential to alter people's research
directions and collaboration networks.

third, we make methodological contributions by highlighting the benefits of long-
term studies that amalgamate multiple forms and uses of data. prospective
experiments can support multiple lines of investigation involving both near-term
and long-term outcomes that may not be possible in retrospective, archival
studies and suggests the use of multiple sources of data for unpacking the
dynamics of knowledge production.

2 theory and hypotheses
2.1 knowledge production and knowledge sharing

according to the knowledge-based view of the firm, knowledge production is a
multicomponent process that involves the transfer, creation and diffusion of
knowledge (grant, 1996; kogut & zander, 1992; nonaka, 1994). knowledge
transfer involves the movement of facts, relationships, and insights from one
setting to another, and becomes evident when the experience acquired by an
individual, group or organization in one setting is applied in another setting
(argote, 2012; hansen, 1999; szulanski, 1996). knowledge creation refers to the
generation of facts, relationships and insights to solve new problems (nonaka,

1994). the emphasis on new knowledge is what distinguishes the process of.

(argote, 2012; hansen, 1999; szulanski, 1996). knowledge creation refers to the
generation of facts, relationships and insights to solve new problems (nonaka,
1994). the emphasis on new knowledge is what distinguishes the process of
knowledge transfer from creation. because new knowledge is not held by anyone
prior to its creation, it cannot be transferred and applied directly (mcfadyen &
cannella jr, 2004). conversely, knowledge diffusion refers to the process through
which transferred or newly created knowledge is disseminated and used by other
individuals, groups and organizations (fleming et al., 2007; singh, 2005).
knowledge diffusion is a critical component of the knowledge production process
because it reduces duplication of effort and promotes efficiency by demarcating
what is known from what is yet to be explored on the knowledge frontier
(boudreau & lakhani, 2015).

 

  

critical to the efficiency of knowledge production is the process of knowledge
sharing between individuals possessing different types of knowledge (grant,
1996; kogut & zander, 1992; nonaka, 1994), and their ability to learn from these
interactions (levinthal & march, 1993; simon, 1991). common knowledge
between partners is important because it enables individuals to absorb the
aspects of their knowledge sets that they do not hold in common, or that are
unique to each individual (carlile, 2004; cohen & levinthal, 1990; maurer & ebers,
2006). building on prior work, we propose that there are at least two separate
pathways through which people develop their knowledge bases: their field and

unique to each individual (carlile, 2004; cohen & levinthal, 1990; maurer & ebers,
2006). building on prior work, we propose that there are at least two separate
pathways through which people develop their knowledge bases: their field and
intellectual specialties. because of the path-dependent nature of knowledge
(hargadon & sutton, 1997), the overlap in two individuals’ field and intellectual
specialties may have different implications on knowledge production. table 1
provides a summary of our knowledge constructs.

research summary

we investigate how knowledge similarity between two individuals is
systematically related to the likelihood that a serendipitous encounter results
in knowledge production. we conduct a field experiment at a medical research
symposium, where we exogenously varied opportunities for face-to-face
encounters among 15,817 scientist-pairs. our data include direct observations
of interaction patterns collected using sociometric badges, and detailed,
longitudinal data of the scientists’ postsymposium publication records over 6
years. we find that interacting scientists acquire more knowledge and

longitudinal data of the scientists’ postsymposium publication records over 6
years. we find that interacting scientists acquire more knowledge and
coauthor 1.2 more papers when they share some overlapping interests, but
cite each other's work between three and seven times less when they are from
the same field. our findings reveal both collaborative and competitive effects
of knowledge similarity on knowledge production outcomes.

managerial summary

managers often try to stimulate innovation by encouraging serendipitous
interactions between employees, for example by using office space redesigns,
conferences and similar events. are such interventions effective? this article
proposes that an effective encounter depends on the degree of common
knowledge shared by the individuals. we find that scientists who attend the
same conference are more likely to learn from each other and collaborate
effectively when they have some common interests, but may view each other
competitively when they work in the same field. hence, when designing
opportunities for face-to-face interactions, managers should consider
knowledge similarity as a criteria for fostering more productive exchanges.
