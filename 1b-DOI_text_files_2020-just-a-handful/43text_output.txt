expected wbph to have a lower impact on bph at the higher temperature.

based on differences in the performance of bph and wbph at 25 and 30°c, we
expected wbph to have a lower impact on bph at the higher temperature.
however, contrary to predictions, wbph had its greatest negative impact on bph
oviposition, nymph survival and nymph weight gain at 30°c (figure 6). egg laying
in both species was reduced by intra- and interspecific crowding. however, the
negative effects of competition with heterospecifics for oviposition space were
consistently greater on bph than on wbph (as indicated by the index of
competition) and were greater at 30°c, despite wbph laying fewer eggs at that
temperature (figure s1g,h). we suggest that intense intraspecific competition
between ovipositing bph at the higher temperature, together with the added
impact of interspecific crowding, resulted in the relatively larger decline in bph
egg numbers per female at 30°c compared to 25°c (figure 6).

the rate of development of bph nymphs increased in the presence of wbph at
25°c, but not at 30°c where the opposite tended to occur (figure 4i-l; figure 6).
our results suggest that bph development accelerated under the unfavourable
conditions created by intense competition for resources with wbph at the lower
temperature (e.g. see biomass of wbph nymphs at 25 and 30°c in the same
cages as presented in figure s1w,x). bph nymph survival and biomass declined it
the presence of wbph, but the effect was again greatest at 30°c (figure 4a-d,q-
t), despite the deleterious effects of the high temperature on wbph nymphs in
the same cages (figure s1k,l,0,p,w,x). this decoupling of resource use by wbph

 

 

the presence of wbph, but the effect was again greatest at 30°c (figure 4a-d,q-
t), despite the deleterious effects of the high temperature on wbph nymphs in
the same cages (figure s1k,l,0,p,w,x). this decoupling of resource use by wbph
from its antagonistic impact on the heterospecific indicates that the effects were
due to interference competition mediated through the host plant. a consistently
greater impact of wbph on bph nymph performance at 30°c compared to 25°c,
suggests that intraspecific competition between bph nymphs or increased
activity, including increased phloem probing, further enhanced the negative
effects of interspecific competition on bph (figure 6; figure $5). plant defences
may also have functioned more effectively under the higher temperature.

4.3 potential mechanisms of interference competition

wbph has previously been shown to induce rice defences against magnaporthe
grisea (kanno & fujita, 2003; kanno et al., 2005) and xanthomonas oryza pv. oryzae
(gomi et al., 2010; satoh et al., 2009), the causal agents of rice blast and bacterial
blight respectively. wbph herbivory stimulates the production of salicyclic acid
(sa) and jasmonic acid ja) involved in the rice plant's general defence system
(kanno et al., 2012). attacks also stimulate the production and release of green
leaf volatiles, including the (z)-3-hexenal that increases rice susceptibility to the
planthopper (gomi et al., 2010; wang et al., 2015), and induces the accumulation
of defensive rice flavonoids and diterpenoids (kanno et al., 2012). this induction
of defences that is known to function against plant diseases probably also plays a

planthopper (gomi et al., 2010; wang et al., 2015), and induces the accumulation
of defensive rice flavonoids and diterpenoids (kanno et al., 2012). this induction
of defences that is known to function against plant diseases probably also plays a
role in the reduction of bph fitness by wbph on the same plants, particularly
since the effects can be seen in plants after prior wbph infestation. for example,
in a study by matsumura and suzuki (2003), prior feeding by wbph delayed the
development of bph nymphs by about 1 day (ca 7%). the greater impact of wbph
on bph nymphs at elevated temperatures (i.e. 30°c compared to 25°c) may be
related to a greater induction of such host defences at high temperatures. for
example, in a review by bidart-bouzat and imeh-nathaniel (2008) warmer
temperatures were associated with increased production of volatile organic
compounds, similar to those that facilitate wbph and are antagonistic to plant
pathogens. higher feeding rates at elevated temperatures can overwhelm plant
defences (havko et al., 2020; horgan, arida, et al., 2020a), but they could also lead
to greater plant resistance at higher temperatures where planthoppers ingest
larger quantities of plant defensive chemicals.

4.4 concluding remarks

in our mixed-species experiments, higher temperatures had a net beneficial
effect on rice by reducing the fitness of a superior competitor (wbph), but
maintaining the deleterious effects of that competitor on a high temperature-
tolerant heterospecific. our simulated life tables depicted a significantly slower

effect on rice by reducing the fitness of a superior competitor (wbph), but
maintaining the deleterious effects of that competitor on a high temperature-
tolerant heterospecific. our simulated life tables depicted a significantly slower
build-up of planthoppers on rice infested with wbph alone or with mixed bph-
wbph cohorts, compared to rice infested with bph alone (figure 5). because bph
is favoured by the higher temperatures that are now more prevalent in some rice-
growing regions (horgan, arida, et al., 2020a, 2020b), then maintaining wbph as.
an antagonist may ultimately be more beneficial than controlling it (e.g. satoh

et al, 2009), particularly since bph is a more damaging herbivore (horgan, arida,
et al., 2020b). the outcome of the combined positive and negative interactions
between bph and wbph indicates one mechanism by which the maintenance of
biodiversity promotes stability in herbivore assemblages and thereby increases
the resilience of ecosystems to the warmer temperatures predicted under global
climate change.

4 discussion

horgan, arida, et al. (2020b) have recently reviewed information on the
temperature profiles of bph and wbph. these authors indicated that, whereas
the two species have similar temperature tolerances and similar thresholds for
development, wbph performs better (i.e. higher fecundity, faster development,
greater weight gain) at lower temperatures and bph at higher temperatures.
furthermore, temperatures of =35°c were detrimental for the eggs and nymphs
of both species (see also park et al., 2013; piyaphongkul et al., 2012). our results
for adult survival, oviposition and nymph growth and development largely
followed these trends. based on observed differences in planthopper responses
to temperatures and because bph facilitates wbph feeding and development
(cao et al., 2013; matsumura & suzuki, 2003; srinivasan et al., 2016), we predicted
that the presence of bph would counter the detrimental effects of high
temperatures (i.e. 30°c) on wbph. furthermore, because it is a superior
competitor to bph (cheng et al., 2001; srinivasan et al., 2016), we predicted that
wbph would have a greater impact on bph populations at 25°c, which is close to

lantin al fre wird than vt 207 lnwnine bread an at aynarimante

temperatures (i.e. 30°c) on wbph. furthermore, becau a superior
competitor to bph (cheng et al., 2001; srinivasan et al., 2016), we predicted that
wbph would have a greater impact on bph populations at 25°c, which is close to
optimal for wbph, than at 30°c. however, based on our initial experiments,
temperature effects on oviposition were less pronounced than the effects on
nymph growth and development. this was reflected in the relative strength of
responses by planthopper adults and nymphs of both species to crowding under
different temperatures in our experiments.

       

 

4.1 effects of temperature on the facilitation of wbph by
bph

facilitation of wbph oviposition by bph was greatest at low planthopper densities
(both conspecific and heterospecific), particularly on ir22, and at 30°c (i.e. on the
lower quality host and at the less favourable temperature for wbph: figure 3f;
figure s1g,h). this supported our prediction that interspecific facilitation would
assist wbph in overcoming the direct, negative effects of higher temperatures. it
also promoted wbph oviposition on a less favoured host. however, an apparent
lack of facilitation at higher female densities suggests that intra- and interspecific
competition countered the effects of facilitation on oviposition, particularly at the
higher temperature (figure s1g,h). because planthoppers oviposit within
relatively localised areas near the base of the rice stem (cheng et al., 2001) and
because bph fernales will oviposit during darkness, whereas wbph females do

higher ternperature (figure 51g,h). because planthoppers oviposit within
relatively localised areas near the base of the rice stem (cheng et al., 2001) and
because bph females will oviposit during darkness, whereas wbph females do
not (horgan, et al., 2016), we suggest that this was mainly due to competition for
stem space.

 

   

facilitation by bph also improved wbph nymph performance at 30°c. however,
in contrast to the facilitation of wbph oviposition, the facilitation of nymphs was
most apparent where bph densities were high (figure 4e-h; figure s1w,x)..
facilitation of wbph feeding is associated with bph-induced physical and
biochemical changes to the rice plant. for example, based on epg recordings, cao
et al. (2013) have shown that wbph locate phloem more quickly and tend to suck
phloem for longer on plants previously infested by bph. furthermore, bph
feeding induces the production of (z)-3-hexenal in rice (wang et al., 2008); the
volatile (z)-3-hexanal is associated with susceptibility to wbph (wang et al., 2015).
because these factors depend on the magnitude and nature of bph damage to
rice, they are decoupled from the direct effects of temperature on wbph

(figure 6) and may be expected to vary depending on the conditions (e.g.
resistance, age, etc.) of the host plant, or on the feeding history of the facilitator
(i.e. whether bph had developed on a resistant or susceptible natal host: ferrater
& horgan, 2016; horgan, et al., 2016; pan et al., 2016).

bph nymphs attained higher weights at 30°c (f;,74 = 9.880, p = 0.002), and in the
absence of heterospecifics (f1,74 = 5.318, p = 0.024; figure 4q-t). the presence of
wbph had a greater effect in reducing bph nymph biomass at 30°c than at 25°c
as indicated by a significant [temperature*heterospecific presence] interaction
(fiza = 10.853, p < 0.001; figure 4q-t). a significant [temperature*conspecific
density] interaction (f; 74 = 6.097, p = 0.016) was due to a slight divergence in
nymph weights at higher densities, at 30°c (figure 4r,7). totals for nymph
biomass per plant are indicated in figure 4.

wbph nymph weights were lower at 30°c (f;,74 = 227.640, p < 0.001); but

increased in the presence of heterospecifics (f;,74 = 8.337, p = 0.005; figure 4u-x).

strong facilitation of wbph nymph weight gain by heterospecifics under
conditions of intraspecific crowding, on ir22, at 25°c produced a significant
[variety*temperature*hereteospecific* conspecific density] interaction

(fy,74 = 5.291, p = 0.024; figure 4u-x). losses in nymph biomass due to
interspecific competition were greater for bph (f;,g0 = 8.475, p = 0.005) and
greatest at 30°c (f;,a0 = 5.344, p = 0.023; figure $5; table $5).

 

 

3.5 life tables

simulated offspring numbers increased over three generations (f:,9¢ = 1,260.730,
p <0.001), however, there was a significant [generation*cohort type] interaction
(fa.g6 = 9.146, p < 0.001) because of similar numbers of offspring during the first
generation, but lower numbers in wbph (alone) cohorts or mixed bph/wbph
cohorts compared to cohorts with bph (alone) during the second and third
generations (figure 5). there was also a significant [generation*variety]
interaction (fo,96 = 8.799, p < 0.001) because of similar numbers of offspring on
both varieties during the first generation, but lower numbers on t6s in
subsequent generations. fewer offspring were produced on t65 than on ir22
(between subject effect: f; ag = 8.026, p = 0.007), largely due to lower oviposition
by bph on t65 during the environmental chamber experiments (figure 5). there

(between subject effect: f; ag = 8.026, p = 0.007), largely due to lower oviposition
by bph on t65 during the environmental chamber experiments (figure 5). there
was no significant temperature effect, or significant interactions between
temperature and between-subject or within-subject factors (all f< 0.816). fewer
offspring from wbph and mixed cohorts than from bph cohorts (between subject
effect: fz,ag = 9.850, p < 0.001) suggests that the presence of wbph on plants
would reduce total offspring numbers irrespective of temperature and despite
lower performance by the species at 30°c.

a density of 12 per plant (f;,59 = 12.788, p < 0.001), but this was not affected by
the presence of the heterospecific competitor (f 59 = 0.452, p = 0.504; figure 3e-

had no effect on egg numbers at low wbph densities, but caused a reduction in
egg numbers at high densities (f;,59 = 8.876, p = 0.004); the presence of
heterospecifics had a greater effect in facilitating wbph oviposition on ir22 than
on t65, producing a significant [variety*heterospecific presence] interaction

(fi,59 = 6.886, p = 0.011); and wbph egg numbers were higher on ir22 at a density
of two females per plant, and at 25°c producing a significant
[variety*temperature*wbph density] interaction (f159 = 7.221, p = 0.009). greater
facilitation of wbph egg laying by bph at the low wbph density, on ir22 and at
30°c (figure 3f) produced a significant four factor interaction (f;,59 = 8.024,

3.4 interspecific competition between planthopper nymphs

bph nymph survival was not affected by temperature or the presence/absence of
heterospecifics (figure 4a-d; table $4). wbph nymph survival declined at the
higher temperature (f; 74 = 22.033, p < 0.001) and declined in the presence of bph
(fiza= 4.117, p = 0.046). however, the effect was greater at a density of 5 wbph
per plant than at 15 per plant (f;,74 = 7.736, p = 0.007; figure 4e-h). development
of bph nymphs was faster in the presence of wbph nymphs, but only at 25°c
(fiza = 47.909, p = 0.037), the effect was greatest under conditions of low
conspecific densities, producing a significant [temperature*conspecific
density*heterospecific presence] interaction (f;,74 = 10.378, p = 0.002; figure 4i-

(figure 1; table s2). bph survived longer at 25 and 30°c than at 35°c, whereas
wbph females survived longer at 25°c than at the other temperatures

(figure 1a-d; table 1). bph survived longer on ir22 plants, but variety had no
effect on wbph survival (figure 1a-d; table 1). egg laying by either planthopper
species was not affected by temperature (table 1). wbph laid more eggs on t65
plants (figure 1g,h); but there was no effect of variety on egg laying in bph

(figure 1e,f). however, there was a significant [temperature*variety] interaction

1 introduction

global temperatures have increased by 0.5-0.9°c over the last several decades.
based on global carbon dioxide (co2) emissions, temperatures are predicted to
increase a further 1.0-3.0°c before 2100 ad (horgan, 2020; ipcc, 2014). global
warming directly affects ectothermic species in a number of ways: species may
develop faster or grow larger during immature stages, they may increase their
distribution ranges poleward or to higher altitudes or they may alter the seasons
and routes of their migrations (horgan, 2020; hullé et al., 2010; lu et al., 2012; wu
et al,, 2019; trnka et al., 2007). compared to such direct effects, predicting the
indirect impacts of temperature on herbivore populations as mediated through
host plants, endosymbionts or natural enemies is a more challenging task—
particularlyifor biodiverse ecosystems.wheretargeinumbersiof species:interact
acrossimultiple trophic levels (barton & tes) 2014) bidartbolzit& imeh-
nathaniel, 2008; horgan, 2020; jeffs & lewis, 2013; meisner et al., 2014).

 

particularly for biodiverse ecosystems where large numbers of species interact
across multiple trophic levels (barton & ives, 2014; bidart-bouzat & imeh-
nathaniel, 2008; horgan, 2020; jeffs & lewis, 2013; meisner et al., 2014).
antagonistic interactions between species have the potential to dampen the
positive direct effects of climate change on herbivores; for example, herbivore
damage may actually decrease during periods of elevated temperature if the
regulatory services provided by natural enemies increase to a greater extent than
the (dis)services caused by herbivore populations (hullé et al., 2010). in contrast,
species interactions that facilitate herbivore survival and development have the
potential to enhance the positive effects of climate change on herbivores (barton
& ives, 2014). these contrasting outcomes are the result of condition-dependent
responses at the community level.

phloem-feeding insects are frequently used as models for climate change
research (han et al., 2019; hullé et al., 2010; meisner et al., 2014). phloem feeders
induce specific defence responses in the host, often with significant cross-talk
between response pathways that generates complex, plant-mediated interactions
between competing herbivores, or between the herbivores and the host plant's
ephyphytes or pathogens (denno et al., 2000; matsumura & suzuki, 2003; satoh
et al,, 2009). some detailed multi-trophic studies have been conducted to
elucidate the potential effects of elevated temperatures and other changes in
climate on the population dynamics of phloem feeders and on their impacts on

host plants, including crops (barton & ives, 2014; han et al., 2019; meisner
etal, 20u9}. surtie uelated muiu-u uptic stuutes have deert comuucleu lo

elucidate the potential effects of elevated temperatures and other changes in
climate on the population dynamics of phloem feeders and on their impacts on
host plants, including crops (barton & ives, 2014; han et al., 2019; meisner

et al,, 2014). such studies have shown that changes in climate can alter the
outcomes of interactions between competing herbivores to affect herbivore
community structure and the composition of plant communities (lin et al., 2018;
ntiri et al. 2016; schadler et al., 2007; sun et al., 2009; wang et al., 2018; wang

et al., 2020). much of this previous research on the nature of temperature-
dependent interspecific interactions between herbivorous insects has focused
primarily on interspecific competition for resources without assessing the effects
of temperature on positive or negative interspecific interactions as mediated
through plant defence pathways.

 

 

in the present study, we investigate temperature-dependent positive (facilitation)
and negative (interspecific competition) interactions between the brown
planthopper (bph), nilaparvata lugens, and the whitebacked planthopper (wbph)
sogatella furcifera, two phloem-feeding planthoppers that co-occur on rice, oryza
sativa, throughout asia (bottrell & schoenly, 2012). because wbph is a superior
competitor to bph (cheng et al., 2001; srinivasan et al., 2016) and has lower
optimal temperatures for nymph development and oviposition (horgan, arida, et
al., 2020b), we predicted that the antagonistic effects of interspecific competition

on bph would be greater at a lower temperature (i.e. 25°c: close to optimum for

wrph) than at a hichar tamneratire (ie 20°c: datrimantal far wrph hut not far
optimal temperatures for nymph development and oviposition (horgan, arida, et

al., 2020b), we predicted that the antagonistic effects of interspecific competition
on bph would be greater at a lower temperature (i.e. 25°c: close to optimum for
wbph) than at a higher temperature (i.e. 30°c: detrimental for wbph, but not for
bph). furthermore, because wbph facilitation is associated with feeding activity
by bph (cao et al., 2013; matsumura & suzuki, 2003; srinivasan et al., 2016), we
predicted that wbph will perform better in the presence of bph than when
feeding alone, thereby achieving greater fitness (survival x reproduction) at
higher temperatures than expected based on single species experiments. we
used a series of reciprocal competition experiments to test these predictions. we
assessed planthopper fitness in the presence of low (without intraspecific
competition) and high (with intraspecific competition) densities of conspecifics,
both with (+ interspecific competition) and without (- interspecific competition)
heterospecifics at constant densities. similar positive and negative interspecific
effects under varying levels of competitor (wbph) or facilitator (bph) activity as
related to the temperature optima for each species would suggest that feeding
activities trigger plant-mediated responses to impact heterospecifics, with
resource depletion playing a relatively lesser role. we conducted the experiments
using indica and japonica rice varieties based on observations that wbph
performs better on japonica varieties and bph on indica varieties (horgan,
srinivasan, et al., 2016). we discuss our results in light of the role of induced
defences in determining herbivore and disease pressures on plants.

2 materials and methods

2.1 herbivore species

we used bph and wbph from colonies maintained at the international rice
research institute (irri) in the philippines. the colonies were initiated in 2009
with >500 wild-caught individuals of each species collected from laguna province
(philippines: 14°10'n, 121°13'e). planthoppers of each species were reared
continuously on the variety tn1 (230 days after sowing [das]) in three (wbph) or
five (bph) wire mesh cages (91.5 x 56.5 x 56.5 cm; h x l x w). individuals of the
same species were frequently mixed between cages to avoid inbreeding. the
colonies were kept under greenhouse conditions (26-37°c, 12:12 day:night) with
feeding plants replaced every 3-5 days.

2.2 plant materials

we used two rice varieties in our experiments. ir22 is an indica rice variety that is
susceptible to bph and wbph populations from south and southeast asia. t65 is
a japonica variety from taiwan. the variety is highly susceptible to bph and wbph
from south and southeast asia (horgan et al., 2017). wbph females often lay

susceptible to bph and wbph populations from south and southeast asia. t65 is
a japonica variety from taiwan. the variety is highly susceptible to bph and wbph
from south and southeast asia (horgan et al., 2017). wbph females often lay
more eggs on t65 than on ir22 (horgan, srinivasan, et al., 2016). both varieties
are more susceptible than the natal variety tn1 to planthoppers from the
philippines (both bph and wbph; ferrater et al., 2015; horgan et al., 2017);
although switching between natal and susceptible hosts can result in reduced
planthopper fitness for several generations (alam & cohen, 1998; ferrater

et al,, 2015). seeds of the two varieties were acquired through the irri
germplasm collection. for all experiments, the seed of t65 and ir22 were sown
to #0 pots (5 x 2.5 cm: h x r) filled with paddy soil. the plants received no
fertilisers and were not treated with any chemicals. at 15-18 das, the plants (one
per pot) were placed under acetate cages (45 x 5 cm: h x r), each with a mesh top
and side window. the cages were placed in the temperature chambers to allow
the plants to acclimatise to the final experimental temperatures (i.e. either 25, 30
or 35°c). all planthopper infestations were to plants at 20 das. during the
experiments, the plants were monitored for symptoms of hopper damage
yellowing or desiccation) to ensure that no plants died during the experiments.
initiating experiments with only a single 20-day-old seedling per pot intensified
competition pressures without killing the plants.

2.3 climate chamber experiments

bioassays were conducted in environmental chambers with the conviron
cmp6050 control system (conviron). temperature treatments were rotated
between four separate chambers—changing the temperature settings after each
experimental run. in some cases, one or two further runs were conducted by
randomly assigning test temperatures to the chambers. each replicate (i.e. run)
included between one and five subsamples (i.e. rearing cages—see below) per
variety, and per intra- and interspecific planthopper density, depending on the
availability of plants and planthoppers and on available space in the climate
chambers (i.e. up to a maximum of 200 cages per temperature per run: see
table 1). subsamples were randomised within chambers. we conducted studies
at 25 and 30°c based on apparent temperature optima for oviposition in wbph
and bph respectively (horgan, arida, et al., 2020b). initial experiments to
investigate temperature effects on oviposition and nymph development were
also conducted at 35°c. relative humidity was maintained at 85% for all
temperatures using an integrated fine-mister.

 

2.3.1 assessment of temperature effects on planthopper ovipos'

oviposition by bph and wbph on ir22 and t65 was examined at three
temperatures. gravid females were collected from the bph and wbph colonies

oviposition by bph and wbph on ir22 and t65 was examined at three
temperatures. gravid females were collected from the bph and wbph colonies
and carefully placed into the cages described above (one female per cage and
one plant per cage) in environmental chambers set at 25, 30 or 35°c. females
were not acclimated, but were taken directly from the source colonies to the
chambers during early morning. the females were allowed to feed and oviposit
for up to 20 days. plants were destructively sampled each day, noting the female
condition (alive or dead) and transferring living females to fresh plants. sampled
plants were dissected under a stereo-microscope to count egg clusters and eggs
and the plants were then dried for >5 days in a forced draft over at 60°c and
weighed. egg production per female was calculated as the sum of eggs laid each
day until the individual female had died (for further details see methods in
horgan, arida, et al., 2020b). the experiment was replicated four times (i.e.
runs: table $1).

 

2.3.2 assessment of temperature effects on nymph development

neonate planthoppers were placed into cages (described above, each with one
1r22 or t65 rice plant) at a density of 10 neonates per plant, using a handmade
pooter. neonates were not acclimated before the experiments. the neonates
were collected from the source colonies within 6 hr of hatching and were
transferred to the chambers during the early morning. the nymphs were allowed

to feed and develop for 15 days in environmental chambers set at 25, 30 and
pooler. neoriales were nil acclimated pelore te experiments, me rieonales

were collected from the source colonies within 6 hr of hatching and were
transferred to the chambers during the early morning. the nymphs were allowed
to feed and develop for 15 days in environmental chambers set at 25, 30 and
35°c. after 15 days, the plants were destructively sampled and the number of
surviving nymphs and their developmental stages recorded. the nymphs and
plants were then dried in a forced draft oven at 60°c for >5 days and weighed.
the experiment was replicated five times (i.e. 5 runs: table s1).

 

2.3.3 interspecific competition between ovipositing planthoppers

plants and cages were prepared as described above. to calibrate the competition
experiments we first assessed the intensity of intraspecific competition for
oviposition at a range of densities and at the different temperatures. a high
density, at which competition was observed (based on reduced egg-laying per
individual), but without killing the host plant, was selected for experiments at
each temperature. gravid female planthoppers were taken directly from source
colonies and placed in cages, each with a single ir22 or t65 rice plant as follows:
in a first series of cages, bph densities were kept constant at four females (for
experiments at 25°c) or six females (for experiments at 30°c) per plant, whereas
densities of wbph in the same cages were set at 0, 2 or 12. aset of cages with
wbph at 2 and 12 per plant, but without heterospecifics was also maintained
(table s1). in the second series of cages, wbph densities were kept constant at
four or six females per plant (for experiments at 25 and 30°c, respectively),

whereas densities of bph females were set at 0, 2 and 12 per plant. a set of cages
with bph females at 2 and 12 per plant, but without heterospecifics was also
maintained (table s1). higher densities of planthoppers in the experiments at
30°c were required to counter increased plant growth rates at the higher
temperature (unpubl. data) and thereby ensure that competition occurred.

the experiment was replicated five times (n = 5: table s1) in chambers at 25 and
30°c. during each run, plants were alll infested on the same day. females were
allowed to feed and oviposit for seven days after which, the plants were cut above
the soil and were dissected under a stereo-microscope (10x magnification) to
count egg clusters and eggs. eggs of bph and wbph can be distinguished based
on their colour and form. plants were dried in a forced draft oven at 60°c for

>5 days before weighing.

2.3.4 interspecific competition between planthopper nymphs

neonate planthoppers were taken directly from source colonies within 6 hr of
hatching and placed in cages, each with a single ir22 or t65 rice plant. based on
preliminary bioassays, a density of 10-25 nymphs per plant was required to

ensure intraspecific competition occurred between nymphs, but without ki

hatching and placed in cages, each with a single ir22 or t65 rice plant. based on
preliminary bioassays, a density of 10-25 nymphs per plant was required to
ensure intraspecific competition occurred between nymphs, but without killing
the host plant. in a first series of cages, bph densities were kept constant at 10
per plant, whereas densities of wbph in the same cages were set at 0, 5 and 15
per plant. a set of cages with wbph at 5 and 15 per plant, but without
heterospecifics was also maintained (table s1). in the second series of cages,
webph densities were kept constant at 10 per plant, whereas densities of bph
were set at 0, 5 and 15 per plant. a set of cages with bph at 5 and 15 per plant,
but without heterospecifics was also maintained (table s1). the highest density of
planthoppers (both species) on plants in any treatment was 25 individuals.

 

 

  

the infested plants were maintained in climate chambers set at 25°c or 30°c. the
experiment was replicated five times (n = 5). during each run, plants were all
infested on the same day. nymphs were allowed to feed and develop for 15 days
after which, the number of survivors was recorded. the survivors and plants, cut
above the soil, were then collected and dried at 60°c for >5 days in a forced draft
oven before being weighed.

2.4 data analyses

adult survival, oviposition and nymph performance (survival, development and
biomass) during initial experiments were analysed using univariate general linear
models (| ms) with temneratiire variety and thi

 

eractinns as main factors,

adult survival, oviposition and nymph performance (survival, development and
biomass) during initial experiments were analysed using univariate general linear
models (lms) with temperature, variety and their interactions as main factors.
plant weight at the end of the experiments was initially included as a covariate in
the analyses, but was removed because it had no significant effect. life-history
parameters were also compared between species by univariate lm (table $2).
interspecific effects on total eggs laid and nymph performance were analysed
separately for planthopper species using univariate lm with conspecific density,
presence/absence of the heterospecific, temperature, variety and their
interactions as main factors. egg numbers and nymph biomass data were log-
transformed, nymph survival was logit-transformed (warton & hui, 2011), and
development was ranked before analyses. residuals were plotted and found to
be normal and homogeneous after parametric analyses. interspecific effects were
assessed for both species in each set of experiments, that is, with one species as
the main test species (with varying densities) and the second as the heterospecific
competitor (with constant densities). we present results only for the main species
in the main text; corresponding results for heterospecific competitors are
presented in figure s1 and tables $3 and s4). to further assess the relative
impacts of bph or wbph on heterospecific egg laying and nymph weights, we
also calculated an ‘index of competition effect’ (see supporting information).

  

the potential effects of interspecific competition on planthopper populations at

also calculated an ‘index of competition effect’ (see supporting information).

 

the potential effects of interspecific competition on planthopper populations at
25 and 30°c were assessed using simulations based on constructed life tables
according to liu and han (2006). we assumed an initial cohort of 200 neonates in
each population and determined the numbers of offspring entering the next
generation based on measured survival and reproduction parameters. offspring
numbers were calculated as the product of the initial population size in each
generation and the proportion of nymphs surviving, the proportion that were
female, the number of eggs laid per female, and the proportions of eggs that
hatch. initial cohorts were either 200 bph alone, 200 wbph alone, or bph and
wbph mixed (100 of each species). values for nymph survival were based on
experiments with intraspecific competition only (density = 15), or interspecific
competition (density = 15 with heterospecifics present at 10 per plant; n= 5). the
sex-ratios of survivors at each temperature were based on experiments reported
by horgan, arida, et al. (2020b). previous experiments with bph reported by
horgan, naik, et al. (2016) suggest that sex-ratios are not significantly affected by
competition. values for female fecundity were based on experiments with
intraspecific competition only (density = 12), or interspecific competition

(density = 12 with heterospecifics present at between 4 and 6 per plant; n= 5).
we applied values of 0.900 and 0.930 for bph hatchability at 25 and 30°c,
respectively, based on information in horgan, arida, et al. (2020b). we used
wbph hatchability values of 0.961 and 0.972 for 25 and 30°c, respectively, based

we applied values of 0.900 and 0.930 for bph hatchability at 25 and 30°c,
respectively, based on information in horgan, arida, et al. (2020b). we used
wbph hatchability values of 0.961 and 0.972 for 25 and 30°c, respectively, based
on data presented by tu et al. (2013) for planthopper eggs at 25 and 28°c. we
simulated populations for three generations (i.e. the typical number of
generations during a single crop cheng et al., 2001). offspring numbers were
analysed using a repeated measures lm with cohort-type (bph, wbph, or mixed)
as the main factor. the analysis assumes that the presence of heterospecifics had
a greater impact than the density of heterospecifics in the experiments (see
below).
2. using a series of reciprocal density experiments with gravid females and
developing nymphs, we examined interspecific competition between two
coexisting phloem feeders nilaparvata lugens (bph) and sogatella furcifera
(wbph), on rice at 25 and 30°c.

. wbph performed better (i.e. adults survived longer, nymphs developed
faster and grew larger) at 25°c and bph (i.e. nymphs developed faster) at
30°c. however, contrary to predictions, wbph had a greater effect in
reducing oviposition and nymph performance in bph at 30°c.

. a decoupling of resource use by wbph and its antagonistic effects on bph at
the higher temperature suggests that wbph feeding induces host defences
that reduce bph fitness (i.e. interference competition). meanwhile, bph
facilitated wbph oviposition at 30°c and facilitated wbph nymph
performance at 25 and 30°c. greater facilitation of feeding in wbph nymphs
by bph at high densities suggests that mechanical damage and host
responses to damage increased the fitness of the heterospecific nymphs.

. although bph also facilitated egg-laying by wbph, intra- and interspecific
crowding countered this facilitation at both temperatures. simulated life
tables for planthoppers at 25 and 30°c depicted significantly lower offspring
numbers on rice infested by wbph alone and from mixed bph-wbph
