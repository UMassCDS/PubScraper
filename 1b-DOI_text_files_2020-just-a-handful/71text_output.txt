citation excerpt :
...the daily pet indicator (pet mean, pet max, pet mean
(>27.4°), pet phat, and pet dhat) are counted according to the
hourly pet corresponding to the time of day of the hourly at data a
higher value indicates a higher exposure. we assume that the
threshold of health risks to the human body was 27.4 °c, which was
referenced in hondula et al. (2021). a linear mixed-effects model
(eq. 1) was used to fit five daily pet indicators and five daily at
indicators, respectively...

a multi-sector causal network of urban heat
vulnerability coupling with mitigation
2022, building and environment

citation excerpt :
..for instance, in delhi, india, researchers found that low and
moderate-income populations rarely appeared in expensive rental
housing and highly greenspace [207]. last but not least, some
studies also explored that low-income population groups were
‘more inclined to have higher personal heat exposure, which means
they may stay longer outside [208,208]. mitigation strategies can
intervene in the causal network through both sectors of cause and
effect...

were motivated to undertake this analysis to address a
conceptual shortcoming in published environmental health
literature to date that implicates variability in personal heat
exposure as a key driver of variability in adverse heat-health
outcome. we found that the extent to which risk factors were
statistically associated with personal heat exposure was
sensitive to both metric choice and study time frame (day
hours, night hours, or all hours). distinguishing and
integrating daytime (e.g., occupation) exposure from
nighttime (e.g., residential) exposure may be an important
consideration for future research as well as in the design of
interventions and policies that aim to protect public health.

 

our results also show that variability in personal heat
exposure may be a causal pathway linking certain social risk
factors to differential heat-health outcomes. of four social
risk factors we examined, time spent outdoors was
significantly related to many personal heat exposure metrics
with a moderate effect size. income and neighborhood were
also associated with significant differences in heat exposure,
‘smncanty teatea wo miaily personal near exposare niettics—
with a moderate effect size. income and neighborhood were
also associated with significant differences in heat exposure,
mostly for nighttime metrics. to the best of our knowledge,
this study is one of the first to demonstrate such links
empirically. time spent outdoors is rarely explicitly
operationalized in the temperature-health literature and thus
more data related to individual time-activity patterns could
improve heat-health risk assessments.

 

 

 

finally, consistent with other recent studies, we found that
personal heat exposure and outdoor ambient temperatures
were not well correlated, and that the association between
personal and ambient temperatures varied widely among
study participants. we recommend additional research that
can relate personal heat exposure metrics to physiological
indicators for heat-health risk to better understand which
metrics, especially those other than the mean, are most
appropriate and useful, and for whom. with these insights in
hand, we will be better equipped to imagine and implement
interventions that can make a difference for the people most
at risk in an increasingly hot world.

some limitations of our study are common to all personal
heat exposure research. for example, it is possible that
participants underreported the amount of time that they did
not carry their ibuttons, in which case indoor air
temperatures were oversampled. it is also possible that
participants deviated from the study protocol and
wore/carried their ibuttons in an inconsistent manner (e.g.,
on the head or neck instead of near the waist). in most cases
associated errors in iets should be random and not bias
subsequent analysis and interpretation (bailey et al., 2020).
further, it would have been useful to include parameters of
heat exposure beyond air temperature (e.g., humidity) or to
capture geographic sources of high exposure (e.g., through
gps data).

we also did not explicitly connect heat exposure with
thermal discomfort and adverse health events. it is tempting
to think that exposure metrics beyond the mean may be
more informative about ultimate heat-health risks, but
drawing firm conclusions would have required a different
study design, such as the use of biometric or physiological
more informative about ultimate heat-health risks, but
drawing firm conclusions would have required a different
study design, such as the use of biometric or physiological
data. there are at least six studies published within the past
20years that relate measures of personal heat exposure to
certain physiological endpoints (basu and samet, 2002, brook
et al., 2011, modesti et al., 2013, martinez-nicolas et al., 2015,
ejike et al., 2017, runkle et al., 2019). those studies generally
report significant associations between personal exposure
metrics and physiological indicators, and report that those
associations were superior to those based on outdoor
ambient temperatures. however, they did not investigate
how those associations might vary with different personal
exposure metrics. regardless of which metric best correlates
to physiological response, we believe that there is merit to
understanding the full experience of heat by examining a
suite of metrics and seeing how they compare to the mean,
which has been treated as the assumed gold standard widely
in the literature, perhaps without good reason.

in the literature, perhaps without good reason.

the associations we observed between social risk factors and
exposure metrics are based on a cross-sectional study and do
not necessarily indicate causal relationships. while our
decision regarding which social risk factors to examine was
informed by contemporary literature regarding heat
vulnerability and heat-health outcomes, we cannot eliminate
the possibility that there are critical unmeasured
confounders. finally, we used participant-day as the unit of
analysis, but other time frames (e.g., participant-hour) might
also be important to examine. we focused on participant-day
for consistency with the majority of epidemiological heat-
health studies that use day as the temporal unit of analysis.
many of the metrics we calculated do account for sub-daily
variability in exposure. further investigation of the most
relevant and applicable time frames for personal heat
exposure analysis is warranted.

to improve warm season quality of life. our results suggest
that those involved in the planning and implementation of
such measures would be well-advised to conceptualize the
causal pathway between aml
interest in the populations they intend to serve. different
levels of exposure may be an important driver of elevated
risk for some populations, whereas other populations might
be at higher risk because of elevated physiological
susceptibility or other factors. this study suggests that not all
heat vulnerable populations experience heat in the same way
and, therefore, intervention measures should be specifically
focused on reducing personal heat exposure in ways that
target those groups. for example, nighttime, rather than
daytime, personal heat exposure was associated with living
in a heat vulnerable neighborhood. accordingly, intervention
measures focused on reducing heat exposure for populations

in a heat vulnerable neighborhood. accordingly, intervention

that different intervention strategies, even those focused
specifically on urban cooling, have differential effects at
different times of day (hondula et al., 2014, li et al., 2014).

for decision makers such as the united states occupational

our results suggest that more messaging and resources
should be directed toward individuals who spend
considerable time outdoors in the warm season. these efforts
could include strengthening protections and resources for
outdoor workers, which have been described as insufficient
in our study region for preventing adverse heat-health
outcomes (petitti et al., 2013). we also encourage public
health entities, electrical utilities, researchers, and city
governments to ensure that intervention programs and

(2020) similarly reported a high level of variability in indoor

negligence of landlords prevents some people from using ac.
we should continue and expand efforts to target lower-
income individuals and communities with programs that can
reduce personal heat exposure, either through community

the five metrics we tested for characterizing personal heat
exposure revealed different patterns between groups’
exposures at the scale of participant-days than would have
emerged with the analysis of one metric alone. while our
‘exposure revealed different patterns between groups’
exposures at the scale of participant-days than would have
emerged with the analysis of one metric alone. while our
methods and findings largely conform to the established
personal heat exposure research paradigm, we go further by
using metrics that capture exposure frequency and duration
(eg. pmat and lep), rather than intensity alone
iet). the most common focus in personal heat exposure
research published to date has been the mean, although
metrics equivalent to pmat have also been examined (e.g.,
hass and ellis, 2019). we found strong evidence that mean
iet is a good, but perhaps not optimal, measure for assessing
groupwise differences in exposure. if mean iet was the only
variable that we had examined, we would have reached
roughly the same conclusions regarding the effect of the
independent variables. however, in some cases, we would
have underestimated effect sizes, or reached different
outcomes with respect to statistical significance.

 

we also found that the time frame over which metrics were
calculated influenced our conclusions. not only did we find

we also found that the time frame over which metrics were
calculated influenced our conclusions. not only did we find
that day hours and night hours exposures are weakly
correlated, we also found that some associations between
independent variables and exposure metrics were very
different between day and night. there have been multiple
personal heat exposure studies regarding the nature of
workplace heat exposure (e.g,, uejio et al., 2018, runkle et al.,
2019), which are often tied to daytime conditions. while our
study did not focus on workplace exposures specifically, our
analysis indicates that separation of daytime (often work and
school time) and nighttime (often residential and sleeping
time) periods for analysis is necessary to characterize
diversity in individuals’ cumulative thermal experiences.
these results support the notion that temperature-health
epidemiological studies that link attributes of patients or
decedents to their place of residence are only capturing a
portion of the information that would be helpful to
understand the magnitude and causal determinants of
variability in heat exposure. it seems likely to us that some of

  

 

 

understand the magnitude and causal determinants of
ity in heat exposure. it seems likely to us that some of
the unexplained variance in prior temperature-health
analyses, including modest correlations between various
vulnerability indices and heat-health outcomes, is related to
our reliance to date on residential address as the source of
key demographic and environmental attributes that influence
exposure (and perhaps other components of vulnerability
and risk) (see harlan et al., 2013, chuang and gober, 2015,
hondula et al., 2015).

4.2. personal heat exposure may be a causal link
between some risk factors and heat-health
outcomes

the association between heat and health outcomes depends
on many variables including the physiological susceptibility
of the population and its adaptive capacity. few studies have
explored the extent to which exposure is a contributing

factor to that association. we found evidence to suggest that
variability in exposure may be an important link in the causal
explored the extent to which exposure is a contributing

factor to that association. we found evidence to suggest that
variability in exposure may be an important link in the causal
pathway between heat and health outcomes, particularly for
certain individual-level variables. for example, consistent
with prior research (bernhard et al., 2015), we found that the
amount of time spent outside and income were associated
with personal heat exposure.

 

variability in personal heat exposure by income is consistent
with epidemiological literature that reports differences in
heat-related morbidity and mortality between different
income groups (e.g., harlan et al., 2013, gronlund et al., 2015).
our results support the widely held assumption that
differences in exposure between individuals with different
incomes are at least part of the reason why there is an
association between income and heat-related morbidity and
mortality. we encourage more research that probes the
underlying causal mechanisms that lead lower-income
individuals to have higher personal heat exposure

underlying causal mechanisms that lead low
individuals to have higher personal heat exposure
(particularly at night) and the relative influence of those
causal mechanisms in different geographic and cultural
contexts. hypothesized mechanisms include access to and
use of effective air conditioning and other cooling devices,
type of employment, and place of residence and employment
within the varied microclimates of urban areas.

income

of the four social risk factors we examined, time spent
outside was the factor most strongly and consistently
associated with personal heat exposure. it is thus concerning
that sub-daily time-activity patterns have not been
sufficiently incorporated into heat-health research (but see
martinez-nicolas et al., 2015). activity patterns may be a
source of unexplained variance, or possibly an unmeasured
confounding variable, in population-scale and daily-timescale
studies (following gronlund, 2014, mila et al., 2020).
unfortunately, individual sub-daily time-activity pattern data
are difficult to obtain at scale and difficult to couple with
medical records. to complete this connection, we encourage

 

 

are difficult to obtain at scale and difficult to couple with
medical records. to complete this connection, we encourage
more use of large-scale data sets like the american time use
survey in personal heat exposure and heat-health research
(eg., hoehne et al. 2018), and also innovative strategies to
capture time-activity patterns in panel and cross-sectional
studies that do not overly burden research participants.
ethnographic research is also essential to know with
sufficient detail where people are when they are outside, why
they are in those locations, and the extent to which certain
protective measures are used and under what circumstances.

the location of our study in a hot setting may influence time-
activity patterns. in metro phoenix, outdoor activities are
often carefully planned to coincide with lower temperatures
whenever possible. due to the high temperatures in metro
phoenix, it is possible that time spent outside has a larger
effect on personal heat exposure compared with other
regions, or that due to people’s intentionality around outdoor
activities, it is a more salient indicator of people's agency (or
lack thereof) compared to elsewhere. to the best of our
regions, or that due to people’s intentionality around outdoor
activities, it is a more salient indicator of people's agency (or
lack thereof) compared to elsewhere. to the best of our
knowledge, our study is the first to extend iet research into a
hot, arid region and we encourage researchers to explore iets
in other understudied climate zones and engage in cross-city
comparisons.

 

neighborhood vulnerability was associated with personal
heat exposure during the night hours time frame with small
effect sizes. this finding supports the notion that differences
in housing conditions within a residentially segregated city
(e.g. harlan et al., 2019) have the greatest impact on
exposure disparities while people are most likely at home.
the lack of associations between home cooling type and
personal heat exposure likely emerged because our survey
questions only asked about the presence of a central air
conditioner rather than anything regarding how participants
use air conditioning or other cooling devices. we anticipate
that there is significant heterogeneity in air conditioning use
among the participants who own a unit, driven in part by

 

 

 

use air conditioning or other cooling devices. we anti
that there is significant heterogeneity in air conditioning use
among the participants who own a unit, driven in part by
differences in income, preference, dwelling quality, air
conditioning age and efficiency, and other factors (e.g.,
sampson et al., 2013, wright et al., 2020).

 

4.3. suitability of outdoor ambient temperatures
as a proxy for personal exposure

similar to other recent studies (e.g., bernhard et al., 2015,
sugg et al., 2019), we found that outdoor ambient
temperatures as measured at a fixed-point weather station
are only modestly associated with personal exposures. the
heterogeneity in individual-level iet slopes and correlation
coefficients that we observed provides additional insights
into the nature of personal heat exposure and the role of the
outdoor environment in shaping that exposure.

the slope of the linear regression lines between iet and
outdoor ambient temperature may serve as a type of
sensitivity indicator, quantifying by how much indi

 

ual
the slope of the linear regression lines between iet and
outdoor ambient temperature may serve as a type of
sensitivity indicator, quantifying by how much individual
exposure changes per unit change in outdoor temperatures.
the median all hours slope for our sample, 0.32°c/°c, falls
near other values previously reported for full samples both
during the warm season (0.37°c/°c, bernhard et al., 2015) and
cool season (0.22°c/°c, sugg et al., 2019). however, we also
found that some individuals had much steeper slopes
(approaching 1.0), some had slopes near zero, and a few
individuals had slopes less than zero—indicating that their
iets are lower during hotter time periods. the personal heat
exposure of individuals with steeper slopes is more sensitive
to changes in outdoor temperature: on hotter days, steep
slope individuals experience higher temperatures than they
do on cooler days. this seems to be the paradigm around
which many existing heat response strategies, like early
warning systems, are designed, in that they try to encourage
behavior change or make other resources available on the
hottest days. however, individuals with slopes close to zero,
or even below zero, might also be at risk from heat if they are

  

behavior change or make other resources available on the
hottest days. however, individuals with slopes close to zero,
or even below zero, might also be at risk from heat if they are
constantly exposed to high temperatures, and different
response strategies are likely needed to help such individuals.

outdoor ambient temperatures are clearly insufficient to fully
explain individual-level variability in personal heat exposure.
we observed a median correlation coefficient between
outdoor temperature and iets of 0.44 during all hours, and
near 0.10 for day hours and night hours. as such, for the
median participant, outdoor temperatures explained less
than 20% of the variance in all hours iets and roughly 1%
during day hours and night hours. if those findings are more
broadly applicable, individual-level variations in personal
heat exposure likely represent a source of considerable
exposure misclassification in heat-health literature,
particularly in studies that use fixed-point measures of air or
surface temperatures to represent the exposure of individuals
or groups. because personal heat exposure is a more
physiologically relevant indicator than outdoor ambient
surface temperatures to represent the exposure of individuals
or groups. because personal heat exposure is a more
physiologically relevant indicator than outdoor ambient
temperature (e.g., brook et al., 2011, ejike et al., 2017), greater
attention to, measurement, and modeling of personal heat
exposure can likely improve our understanding of the
relationship between outdoor condition and human health
outcomes. furthermore, because the relationship between
outdoor ambient temperature and personal heat exposure is
neither strong nor consistent between individuals, heat
mitigation strategies designed to lower outdoor temperatures
will clearly have differential impacts for different
populations. we encourage special attention to the places,
people, and circumstances for which reductions in outdoor
temperature would meaningfully impact personal heat
exposure.
4. discussion

this study contributes to a growing body of personal heat
exposure research that highlights the value of precision
measurements in identifying risk factors among a population.
we demonstrated the feasibility of collecting simultaneous
personal heat exposure data from dozens of residents over a
one- week period. this contribution is notable because the
total number of published studies on personal heat exposure,
while growing, remains small, suggesting continued
opportunities to advance study design and rigor. next, we
revealed differences in the characterization of exposure

about the different intensities, frequencies, and durations of

 

revealed differences in the characterization of exposure
based on metric choice, which may compel further thinking
about the different intensities, frequencies, and durations of
exposure that are of interest for health risk analysis. finally,
we found robust links between social risk factors and
personal heat exposure (as measured via iets) among a
sample of residents of metro phoenix. this finding adds to
our understanding of causal pathways that relate ambient
conditions to differences in heat-health and quality of life
outcomes among urban residents. below we discuss findings
and limitations related to the latter contributions in more
detail.
income was the second strongest determinant of heat
exposure in this study based on the number of significant
effects and overall effect sizes. lower income residents had
higher iet metrics than higher income residents using all
metrics in all time frames, although statistically significant

effects were mostly evident for night hours. the strongest
association was with night hours mean iet (0.38), and all
metrics except for dmat had a significant association during
that time frame (fig. 5, right panel). neighborhood
vulnerability was associated with significant variability in
mean and max iet for night hours, with small effect sizes.
finally, home cooling type was not significantly associated
with any of the 15 iet metrics we examined.

different iet metrics revealed generally similar patterns with
respect to the impact of social risk factors on exposure. we
observed a high degree of consistency concerning the sign of
effects across different metrics; cases where the sign of the
effect varied for different iet metrics all involved estimates
near the null. among the social risk factors that had at least
ificant effect, iet metric choice had modest impacts
on effect size estimates, which in some cases resulted in
some metrics being associated with a significant effect and
others not. for example, the effect of hours out was nearly
50% larger on night hours lep than night hours mean iet
(0.29 versus 0.20), and only the former was significant.

nearly 50% larger than the effect on night hours dmat (0.38

variation in some of the iet metrics we examined was
explained, in part, by variables commonly identified as risk
factors for adverse heat-health outcomes in the
environmental health literature. this assessment was
sensitive to both the choice of iet metric and exposure time
frame. of the 60 associations we tested, there were 19 with a
statistically significant effect (table 2). of those, the sign of
the effect was in the hypothesized direction in all cases. more
generally, across the 60 models, the sign of the effect was in
the hypothesized direction with at least a small effect size
(r>0.1) on 36 occasions (60%). effect sizes were generally
modest; the strongest effects were approximately 0.44, which
is considered medium by conventional benchmarks. there
were no associations with even a small effect size with a sign
in the opposite of the hypothesized direction.

iet summary metrics suggested a wide range in participants’
thermal exposure (fig. 3 and table $4). we found that
participant-day observations of 11 of the 15 metrics were
poorly approximated by the normal distribution based on the
shapiro-wilks normality test (table $4), motivating the use
of non-parametric techniques for comparative analyses.

we examined four independent variables that were
suggested by previous research to be linked with heat
vulnerability in the study region (e.g., harlan et al., 2013,
jenerette et al, 2016). the four social risk factors were:
neighborhood vulnerability, income, home cooling type,
and hours out. neighborhood vulnerability reflected a
categorical classification of participants’ neighborhoods of

 

ghboriood vamneral
and hours out. neighborhood vulnerability reflected a
categorical classification of participants’ neighborhoods of
residence based on the heat vulnerability index developed
by reid et al. (2009) and used by harlan et al. (2013) in
phoenix. it represents a higher-level contextual effect
compared to variables representing individual study
participants. income questions were asked of each
participant in a background survey. home cooling type
indicated the types of cooling devices available in
participants’ homes; we used a binary classification to
indicate participants that had central air conditioning. hours
out reflected the amount of time that participants reported
spending outside on daily surveys completed during the
study period. all survey responses were coded into
categorical variables with two or three groups. specific
details on the calculation of these variables, including
questions from daily and background surveys from which
these variables were derived, are available via kuras et al.
(2016) and in table $3.

2.5. analysis

for the first objective, we calculated spearman correlation
coefficients between each of the pairwise combinations of
summary iet metrics to understand the extent to which they
captured different aspects of exposure. we also visually
examined the distributions of each of the 15 metrics using
box plots and histograms, calculated basic descriptive
statistics, and conducted shapiro-wilk tests for normality. for
the second objective, we used the kendall tau-b correlation
coefficient to measure the association between iet metrics
and the four social risk factors, treating each independent
variable as categorical as described above. we applied a
bonferroni correction in the estimation of confidence
intervals for this nonparametric measure of effect size,
dividing the conventional « of 0.05 by 20, the number of
combinations of independent variables and iet metrics
within each time frame. we considered statistically

ant effects to be those for which the bonferroni-

 

 

combinations of independent variables and iet metrics
within each time frame. we considered statistically
significant effects to be those for which the bonferroni-
corrected confidence interval excluded zero. in reporting the
magnitude of the effect, we used the following guidance:
small effects were those with absolute values of correlation
coefficients between 0.1 and 0.3, medium effects were those
with correlation coefficients between 0.3 and 0.5, and large
effects were those above 0.5 (cohen, 1988). we discuss a
limited sample of the effect sizes in the results section; the
complete set of results from these tests are available in
supplementary materials (fig. $2).

for the third objective, we calculated linear regression
models for each participant (rather than participant-day)
with hourly mean observations from phoenix sky harbor
airport as the independent variable and hourly mean iet as
the dependent variable. as in other parts of this study, we
calculated these models for only the four hottest days of the
study week, and for three different time frames (all hours,
day hours, night hours). we report the slopes from these

 

calculated these models for only the four hottest days of the
study week, and for three different time frames (all hours,

regression models as well as the pearson correlation
coefficient, as indicators of exposure misclassification
between iets and outdoor temperatures (similarly to
bernhard et al., 2015, ejike et al., 2017, uejio et al., 2018, sugg
et al., 2019, kennard et al., 2020, bailey et al., 2020, mila et al.,
2020).

participants were included in the final analysis if they
completed both background and daily surveys and collected
at least two full participant-days of iets observations. all data
processing and analysis was conducted open source r

including the desctools and rcompanion packages (signorell
et al., 2016, mangiafico, 2016). see fig. 2 for a full illustration

study. eighty-four participants were recruited to carry
ibuttons for 7 study days. due to an unseasonal rainfall event
and assorted non-compliance issues, the final dataset
included only 64 participants and focused on the 4days with
representative meteorology. we used participant-day (pd) as,
our unit of analysis for objectives 1 and 2, which therefore
resulted in 256 participant-days fit for analysis (64
representative meteorology. we used participant-day (pd) as
our unit of analysis for objectives 1 and 2, which therefore
resulted in 256 participant-days fit for analysis (64
participants multiplied by 4days). pd’s were processed into
three time frames: all hours (ah), day hours (dh), and night
hours (nh). if an individual pd included too many hours of
missing observations, it was not included in the analysis
(percentages in each box show inclusion rate). metrics were
constructed for each pd and analyzed in relation to 4
independent variables. for objective 3, we used the entire iet
time series from the 4days with representative meteorology
(also for ah, dh, and nh) to calculate slope and pearson
correlation coefficient in relation to fixed-point temperature
measurements from phoenix sky harbor airport (kphx). the
inset example at the top illustrates this process from the
perspective of a hypothetical participant.

 
2.3. exposure metrics

we generated five summary iet metrics for each time frame
of each participant-day, capturing dimensions of exposure
intensity, duration, and frequency (table 1; fig. 1; ott et al.,
2006, kuras et al., 2017). the five iet metrics (and
abbreviations used in this manuscript) were: mean iet,
maximum (max) iet, longest exposure period (lep),
percentage minutes above threshold (pmat), and degree
minutes above threshold (dmat) (see table 1). for all
metrics, higher values indicate higher exposure and therefore
higher risk of adverse heat-health impacts. three metrics
(lep, pmat, dmat) were contingent on an external
temperature threshold, above which exposure could be
considered risky in metro phoenix. given our goal of
comparing individuals to one another, we used thresholds
derived from our sample after quality control; namely, the
mean of the entire sample's mean iet for the given day and
time frame. our daily thresholds ranged from 25.7°c to
29.5°c (supplemental materials, table s2), all within the
mean of the entire sample's mean tet tor the given gay and —
time frame. our daily thresholds ranged from 25.7°c to
29.5°c (supplemental materials, table s2), all within the
range of reference points conveying heat-health risk for the
local population (e.g., petitti et al., 2016).

2.1. study location

this study took place in the greater phoenix metropolitan
area, arizona, usa. metro phoenix is home to more than four
million people and is situated within the hot and arid
sonoran desert (képpen-geiger classification bwh), with
average daily maximum air temperatures exceeding 37.8°c
(100f) for 109days each year (noaa, 2016). within the
urbanized region, air and surface temperatures differ widely
between neighborhoods, as do vulnerability to and
incidences of heat-related illness and mortality (harlan et al.,
2006, ruddell et al., 2012, jenerette et al., 2016). large
incidences of heat-related illness and mortality (harlan et al.,
2006, ruddell et al., 2012, jenerette et al., 2016). large
contrasts in heat illness and mortality rates also exist
between different demographic groups; those at higher risk
of heat illness and death include lower-income and racial and
ethnic minority residents, elderly individuals, men, outdoor
workers, and those living in parts of the city with less green
space and higher land surface temperatures (harlan et al.,
2013, hondula et al., 2015, jenerette et al., 2016). this study
compares experienced temperatures across five
neighborhoods with contrasting environmental,
socioeconomic, and demographic characteristics (see
supplemental materials, appendix a, table $1).

 

 

2.2. recruitment and measurement

we used a multi-pronged recruitment strategy to build a
sample of participants that represented a variety of
demographic characteristics and life circumstances. the
sampling method was not intended to produce a statistically
representative sample of each neighborhood nor the
demographic characteristics and life circumstances. the
sampling method was not intended to produce a statistically
representative sample of each neighborhood nor the
population of the region at large, but instead to capture a
diverse set of individuals among whom personal heat
exposure and associations with social risk factors may vary.
participants were recruited in august and september 2014,
via flyers distributed on the street by the research team,
study information bulletins posted in neighborhood
businesses, and emails sent through homeowner
associations. study approval was obtained from the
institutional review board at arizona state university (study
#1454) prior to participant recruitment, with written
informed consent received from all participants. eighty-four
participants were initially enrolled in this study with sixty-
four (76.2%) ultimately included in this analysis. of the
twenty not included, three did not return their equipment,
one participant's equipment malfunctioned, and sixteen did
not complete the requisite background and daily surveys.

the study took place from 20:00 on saturday, september 13
to 20:00 on saturday, september 20, 2014, to measure
personal heat exposure under warm season conditions. we
specifically measured individually experienced temperatures
(iets), which are the ambient air temperatures experienced
by participants in their immediate surroundings, both
indoors and outdoors. as ambient air temperature is only one
of several environmental factors (e.g., humidity, solar
radiation), that contribute to the human energy balance,
thermal comfort, and heat-health risks, iets are a useful,
although not comprehensive, indicator of personal heat
exposure (kuras et al., 2017). other authors have referred to
iets as personal ambient temperatures (e.g., sugg et al.,
2018) and personal-level environmental temperature (e.g.,
brook et al., 2011). to record iets, we equipped research
participants with thermochron ibuttons that measured and
recorded instantaneous air temperature at five-minute
intervals throughout the study period (following kuras et al.,
2015). ibuttons were attached to snap-in key ring mounts and
pecorasa iristantaneous ar remperatare at vette
intervals throughout the study period (following kuras et al.,
2015). ibuttons were attached to snap-in key ring mounts and
connected to a carabiner. participants were asked to clip their
carabiners to a belt loop or bag so as to continuously expose
the device to the surrounding air. we asked participants to
record any periods of time in which they were not carrying
their ibuttons via daily paper or online surveys. due to an
unseasonal rainfall event with lower temperatures midway
through the study week, we focused on the four hottest days,
which were more representative of typical conditions. these
included three weekdays and one weekend day (september
14, 15, 18, 19) during which the mean outdoor temperature
recorded at phoenix sky harbor airport (kphx) was 32.7°c,
the mean minimum was 27.5°c and the mean maximum was
37.9°c (noaa, 2019). september 16 and 17 were omitted

or high temperatures (below ~15°c or above ~44°c); such
values were shifted to within the 0.1th or 99.9th percentile of
iets, respectively. we also screened for implausible acti
patterns that indicated non-compliance with the study
design; such patterns were removed from the analysis (see
supplemental materials, appendix b). finally, for each time
frame we adopted an upper limit for missing observations
above which we removed the entire participant-day from the
analysis (3h for all hours and 1h for day and night hours).
after quality control, the final data set included 235 all hours
participant-days (91.8% of possible observations), 236 day

participant-days (94.5%).

 
2. methods
1. introduction

continued advances in sensor technology and computational
power are leading to new opportunities to measure, with
more precision and validity, how people experience their
environments. within the realm of environmental health,
measuring exposure to indoor and outdoor heat is a topic of
considerable interest. in recent decades, there has been an
increase in awareness of the total public health burden of
heat exposure--heat ranks as a leading weather-related cause
of mortality in the united states and elsewhere (berko et al.,
2014, gasparrini et al., 2015). many population-scale studies
have provided insights into the exposure-response
relationship between “heat” and certain adverse health
outcomes (e.g., gosling et al., 2009, odhiambo sewe et al.,
2018, fu et al., 2018), and other research has examined how
this association varies by certain sub-populations within
cities (e.g., age, racialized group/ethnicity, geographic
location) (harlan et al., 2013, gronlund et al., 2015, hondula
et al., 2015). further, other studies compare behavior- or

 

 

cities (eg. age, racialized group/ethnicity, geographic
location) (harlan et al., 2013, gronlund et al., 2015, hondula
et al., 2015). further, other studies compare behavior- or
preference-based exposures between groups based on
situational or cultural contexts (e.g,, tung et al., 2014).

 

one of the most recently developed lines of research within
the study of environmental heat involves measurement and
quantification of heat exposure at the scale of human bodies.
in measuring personal heat exposure, researchers are striving
to develop a more valid and precise understanding of the
human experience with heat, which may help more
effectively target and evaluate a wide suite of intervention
measures that have been proposed to protect people when
the weather is dangerously hot (kuras et al., 2017).

exposure is often deconstructed into three distinct
dimensions: intensity, duration, and frequency (e.g,, ott et al.,
2006). insights into how personal heat exposure materializes
along each dimension may reveal mechanisms associated
with dangerous exposure as well as the appropriate

along each dimension may reveal mechanisms associated
with dangerous exposure as well as the appropriate
intervention. ott et al. (2006) further offer the concept of an
exposure event, “the occurrence of continuous contact
between an agent and a target.” for thermal exposure, this
definition can be difficult to operationalize, because people
are always exposed to some type of thermal environment.
kuras et al, (2017) offer a definition of personal heat exposure
in which exposure only occurs when there is a “risk of
increase in perceived discomfort andjor core body
temperature,” but this definition still requires clarification in
terms of the exact environmental conditions that pose such a
risk, in recent years, studies have attempted to quantify the
relationship between outdoor conditions and personal
exposure (e.g., basu and samet, 2002, brook et al., 2011,
modesti et al., 2013, martinez-nicolas et al., 2015, kuras et al.,
2015, bernhard et al., 2015, ejike et al., 2017, uejio et al., 2018,
sugg et al., 2018, sugg et al., 2019, hass and ellis, 2019, runkle
et al., 2019, bailey et al., 2020, mila et al., 2020). these studies
have revealed that the environmental conditions people
experience as they move through their daily act
et al., 2019, bailey et al., 2020, mila et al., 2020). these studies
have revealed that the environmental conditions people
experience as they move through their daily activities are not
well approximated by fixed-point weather stations, which
are commonly used in heat-health risk assessment. these
studies also point to considerable heterogeneity in exposure,
especially at the scale of individual people. however, there is
little consistency in the manner in which personal exposure
is quantified or the extent to which the three different
dimensions of exposure are explicitly considered.

 

 

 

s are not

most commonly, personal heat exposure data are
summarized or assessed through a central tendency
framework, for example, by assessing average values per hour
(eg., kuras et al., 2015) or per day (e.g., uejio et al., 2018).
these summary measures are subsequently used in statistical
tests to either draw comparisons between different
timeframes, or make comparisons with various independent
variables including participant or location attributes (e.g.,
bernhard et al., 2015, hass and ellis, 2019, runkle et al., 2019,
(020). few studies use summary metrics beyond

 
 

bernhard et al., 2015, hass and ellis, 2019, runkle et al., 2019,
mila et al., 2020). few studies use summary metrics beyond
the mean to characterize exposure at longer time scales, but
those that do have used extreme temperature values
runkle et al., 2019, kennard et al., 2020), ranges and standard
deviations (ie., modesti et al., 2013, sugg et al., 2018, runkle
et al., 2019), and values above a dangerous threshold (ie.,
hass and ellis, 2019). thus, the majority of published studies
largely focus on the intensity dimension of personal heat
exposure.

 

 

relatedly, a number of personal heat exposure studies have
examined the relationships between ambient temperatures
measured at a fixed location (e.g., an airport weather station)
and temperatures experienced by participants (see bernhard
et al, 2015, ejike et al., 2017, uejio et al., 2018, sugg et al.,
2019, kennard et al., 2020, bailey et al., 2020, mila et al.
2020). investigating such relationships can provide insights
into the severity and sources of exposure misclassification in
heat-health research. exposure misclassification can exist in
beat-healthiescaich for individualsscale.ee, colour and
into the severity and sources of exposure misclassification in
heat-health research. exposure misclassification can exist in
heat-health research for individual-scale (e.g., cohort and
cross-sectional) studies and population-scale (e,
series) studies and bias our understanding of the relationship
between exposure and adverse outcomes, as well as how
those relationships vary across time, space, and sub-
populations. the consequences of exposure misclassification
are well documented in air pollution research and other
environmental health domains (often biasing effects towards
the null) (e.g,, zeger et al., 2000, ozkaynak et al., 2013), but
are only beginning to be thoroughly investigated for extreme
heat (e.g., lee et al., 2016, wu et al., 2019).

 

 

 

 

we argue that the use of a broader suite of metrics that more
comprehensively accounts for the intensity, duration, and
frequency of human heat exposure may be useful for
understanding trends in vulnerability, targeting and
evaluating interventions, and communicating risk. in this

evaluating interventions, and communicating risk. in this
paper, we interrogate the value of such metrics for
characterizing personal heat exposure. our specific objectives
in this paper are to: 1) describe and employ a suite of
exposure metrics capturing key dimensions of personal heat
exposure within an urban population, 2) assess variability in
personal heat exposure between sub-populations
characterized by commonly-evaluated social risk factors, and
3) investigate potential exposure misclassification between
personal heat exposure and fixed-point weather station data.

in exploring the first two objectives, we tested the widely
held and implicit assumption of many environmental health
studies that different types of factors modify the relationship
between outdoor and indoor ambient heat and personal heat
exposure (see fig. 1 of kuras et al., 2017). we hypothesized
that we would observe higher heat exposure among residents
of neighborhoods classified as heat vulnerable, lower-income
individuals, individuals without central air conditioning, and
individuals who self-report spending more time outside. in

a more precise understanding of individual-level heat
exposure may be helpful to advance knowledge about heat-
health impacts and effective intervention strategies,
especially in light of projected increases in the severity and
frequency of extreme heat events. we developed and
interrogated different metrics for quantifying personal heat
exposure and explored their association with social risk
factors. to do so, we collected simultaneous personal heat
exposure data from 64 residents of metropolitan phoenix,
arizona. from these data, we derived five exposure metrics:
mean individually experienced temperature (iet), maximum
iet, longest exposure period (lep), percentage minutes above
threshold (pmat), and degree minutes above threshold
(dmat), and calculated each for day hours, night hours, and
iet, longest exposure period (lep), percentage minutes above
threshold (pmat), and degree minutes above threshold
(dmat), and calculated each for day hours, night hours, and
all hours of the study period. we then calculated effect sizes
for the associations between those metrics and four social
risk factors: neighborhood vulnerability, income, home
cooling type, and time spent outside. we also investigated
exposure misclassification by constructing linear regression
models of observations from a regional weather station and
hourly iet for each participant.

our analysis revealed that metric choice and timeframe
added depth and nuance to our understanding of differences
in exposure within and between populations. we found that
time spent outside and income were the two risk factors

most strongly associated with personal heat exposure. we
also found evidence that mean iet is a good, but perhaps not
optimal, measure for assessing group differences in exposure.
most participants’ iets were poorly correlated with regional

weather station observations and the slope and correlation
coefficient for linear regression models between regional
weather station data and iets varied widely among
participants. we recommend continued efforts to investigate
personal heat exposure, especially in combination with
physiological indicators, to improve our understanding of
links between ambient temperatures, social risk factors, and
health outcomes.
highlights
+ environmental heat exposure considerably varies
between individuals.

+ time spent outdoors was moderately associated
with personal heat exposure.

+ income and vulnerability were weakly associated
with personal heat exposure.

+ weather station observations and personal heat

exposure were poorly correlated.

+ weather station observations and personal heat
exposure were poorly correlated.
