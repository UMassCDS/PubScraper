the logic to support a risk-based approach to regulating endocrine-disrupting chemica
(edcs). key to this approach is the assumption of a threshold of adversity. we, as memt
of the endocrine society’s endocrine-disrupting chemicals (edc) advisory group, wot
like to address two key scientific issues.

1. thresholds of adversity. key to risk assessment is the identification of a threshold of
adversity, that is, the highest dose that does not produce an observable effect on a
chosen endpoint. but, the choice of endpoint is key. for example, the concentration
lead required to affect measures of cognitive function in children is far less than th
lethal dose in adults (eg, (2, 3]) since regulators initially developed safety
determinations for lead exposures based on morbidity and lethality in adults, milli

lead required to affect measures of cognitive function in children is far less than th
lethal dose in adults (eg, (2, 3]) since regulators initially developed safety
determinations for lead exposures based on morbidity and lethality in adults, milli
of children were harmed.

 

lead toxicity presents another challenge: what should be done when no safe level of
exposure can be identified [,-6]? this point could not be made any clearer than the
united states centers for disease control 2012 report on childhood lead poisoning
prevention, which states, “new studies and re-interpretation of past studies have
demonstrated that it is not possible to determine a threshold below which [blood lea
level] is not inversely related to iq” and “it is now clear that there is no known thres!
below which adverse effects of lead are absent.” [7] in this case, it can be argued that
threshold for the effect of lead on brain development and iq could exist, but one has :
been demonstrated empirically. given that the estimated “safe” level of chemical
exposure often decreases as new data become available, it is clear that the early
estimates of safety are often insufficient to protect human health [8].

lead is not alone in its ability to have effects at even very low levels of exposure [9-1
unfortunately, documented low-dose effects exist for dozens, if not hundreds of
chemicals, including edcs. despite the fact that human exposures are low, below the

disease outcomes in a manner that is concordant with mechanistic studies [14-22].
edcs, this reality was acknowledged in a 2017 report by the united states national
academy of sciences [23], which provided recommendations on how the environmer
protection agency (epa) should conduct investigations for low-dose effects of edcs

in addition, as professors demeneix and slama state in a report for the european
parliament [24], approaches used in regulatory toxicology still do not take into accot
the effects of chemical mixtures that impinge on the same endocrine signaling pathv
or on interacting hormones [25]. all children are exposed both prenatally [26] and
postnatally [27] to multiple xenobiotics, many of which have the potential to interfer
with the endocrine system. this emphasizes the need for caution in the use of thresh
focused on individual chemicals.

during a consensus meeting that included regulators, toxicologists, epidemiologists, ar
endocrinologists, a consensus was reached on a series of scientific principles to identify
edcs [28]. it was agreed that the concept of thresholds should be further researched. t
statement on this point concludes “that it may be difficult to distinguish a true thresho!
from an apparent threshold which merely arises from the limits of detection of the

edcs [28]. it was agreed that the concept of thresholds should be further researched. t
statement on this point concludes “that it may be difficult to distinguish a true thresho!
from an apparent threshold which merely arises from the limits of detection of the
experimental system. thus, the question of the existence of dose-thresholds for endocr
disruptors cannot be resolved through empirical dose-response studies alone but has t¢
rely on mechanistic investigations and increased knowledge on the functions and
programming of the endocrine system during specific windows of sensitivity.” moreov:
given that the estimated safe level of chemical exposure is often decreased as new data
become available, the early estimates including uncertainty factors demonstrate that
estimates of the true or practical threshold were overestimated [8].

furthermore, there are several additional reasons why the validated endpoints empl
in the organization for economic co-operation and development (oecd) guidelines
fail to provide clear information about whether or not a threshold exists. first, there
the sensitivity of the biological outcomes evaluated. for example, the uterotrophic as
focuses on organ weight, even though many endocrine-disrupting effects do not ent
any change in the overall organ weight (see [29] for an example). second, the variabi
in results obtained in studies such as the uterotrophic assay depends on protocol
differences, all permitted within validated guidelines, including the use of rats or mi
and their different strains, or injection versus gavage [30]. third, there is the assumy
of a monotonic dose response in regulatory testing that influences all aspects of stud
design; monotonicity is an unlikely default assumption for most edcs [13]

the commentary concludes that “a threshold approach to the risk assessment of [ed
is scientifically justified.” however, it can only be justified if you ignore that endpoin
adversity in standard toxicological studies are not sensitive to edcs [31, 32], that
uncertainty factors often overestimate the theoretical threshold, and that mixture ef
are not considered.

2. hormones and development. (brescia, 2020) also makes the statement that it is an
“extreme position” to hold that the developing organism has “homeostatic mechani
[that] are not sufficiently developed such that a threshold of adversity cannot be
assumed for edcs acting during the developmental stages of the life cycle.” the
commentary further states that this position is “not supported by decades of
observations and safety testing of developmental toxicants, with little evidence
suggesting that the fundamental rules governing endocrine function cease to apply
during this life stage...”.

moreover, use of the term “endocrine function” in the statement above is ambiguou
because the human fetus does not have a functional thyroid gland during the first
trimester of development, despite having a requirement for thyroid hormone for not
development during this period [34,, 35], endocrine function obviously changes throt
development.

perhaps instead what (brescia, 2020) refers to is “endocrine action.” clearly, we are
aware that the fundamental rules of endocrine actions are the same throughout the |
cycle (eg, [36, 37]). rather than being an extreme view [33], it is uniformly held by
scientific societies that fetal development represents a very complex time of hormon
action. thus, the downstream actions of hormones are often quite different during
development compared with the adult, the sensitivity of the fetus to the same hormo
often much greater during development, and the effects downstream of hormone act
are often not reversible [38-41].

development compared with the adult, the sensitivity of the fetus to the same hormo
often much greater during development, and the effects downstream of hormone act
are often not reversible [38-41].

the crux of our perspective, supported by decades of endocrine science, is that if a
chemical interferes with the action of a specific hormone, the effects of exposure wil
consistent with those actions. for example, an antiandrogenic chemical exposure du
fetal development would interfere with testosterone action in the brain and produce
effects that in some cases would not be observed until adulthood [32]. moreover, bec
the developing brain is very sensitive to testosterone, the dose at which an
antiandrogenic chemical would produce adverse effects in the fetus would be lower t
those required to interfere with testosterone actions in the adult.

‘we specifically note that many of the adverse outcomes of edcs are not evaluated in
standard regulatory toxicology testing such as altered neurite outgrowth, neuronal
migration, and myelination (and more) in the brain following thyroid hormone
disruption. further, there is no guideline study that evaluates brain sexual dimorphi:
or sensitive social behaviors in rodents that have had alterations to these sensitive bi
regions [42-44]. while the us epa defines an adverse neurodevelopmental effect as |

also, no regulatory toxicology tests exist that evaluate the impacts of environmental
chemicals on mammary gland morphology or development, and the evaluation of
outcomes relevant to breast cancer are recognized to be insufficient [46-49].

 

even though the us epa defines an adverse effect as “a biochemical change, functior
impairment, or pathologic lesion that affects the performance of the whole organism
reduces an organism’s ability to respond to an additional environmental challenge,
[50] emphasis added], there are no guideline studies that evaluate whether exposure
edcs alter the response of animals to environmental stressors. yet, numerous studie
show that animals exposed to edcs are more sensitive to hormones, carcinogens,
allergens, and other environmental challenges (eg, [51-54]). the recognition of thes
weaknesses in edc testing was the basis for a major effort in the european union fun
by horizon 2020 to identify better endpoints that can be captured by oecd test
guidelines [55]. these are hardly extreme positions.

the suggestion that fetuses, neonates, and infants have sufficient “homeostatic”
functions to protect them from environmental pollutants is in fact an example of an
extreme position that is not supported by evidence. there are numerous studies
documenting that the fetal compartment acts as a depot for some chemicals includin
edcs (eg, perfluorinated compounds [56], polybrominated diphenyl ethers (571).

furthermore, regulatory toxicologists acknowledge the insufficiency of homeostatic

furthermore, regulatory toxicologists acknowledge the insufficiency of homeostatic
functions at different life stages when using adjustment factors to account for life ste
during risk assessments. yet, even the standard default uncertainty factor of 10, whic
typically used to acknowledge the increased vulnerability of fetuses, neonates, infant
and children, is often insufficient; numerous studies provide evidence that individua
these vulnerable stages of development are more than 10-times more sensitive than
adults (58, 59]. this reality has also been acknowledged by regulators in the united
states [60].

endocrinology is a scientific field that relies upon the theory of falsifiability (sometime
also referred to as the popper framework). in our field of study, for a hypothesis to be
credible, it must be disprovable. in contrast, (brescia, 2020) describes a framework whe
the demonstration of a true threshold would “entail studying an infinite number of
organisms of the species in question... using infinitely precise measures... and an infinit
number of doses...” the author acknowledges that “hypotheses regarding where on the
dose-response curve the true threshold lies are beyond the ability of science to resolve”
is therefore not a scientific question.

the endocrine society holds that rigorous scientific evidence, including fundamental

features of endocrinology, should inform safety determinations, even when these featu

which we expose the entire human population.

the concept of a threshold of adversity in toxicology is neither provable nor
disprovable. as such, it is not a scientific question but a theoretical one. yet, the belie
in thresholds has led to traditional ways of interpreting data derived from regulatory
guideline studies of the toxicity of chemicals. this includes, for example, the use of
standard “uncertainty factors” when a “no adverse effect level” (or similar
“benchmark dose”) is either observed, or not observed. in the context of endocrine-
disrupting chemicals (edcs), this approach is demonstrably inappropriate. first, the
efficacy of a hormone on different endpoints can vary by several orders of magnitude
this feature of hormone action also applies to edcs that can interfere with that
hormone. for this reason, we argue that the choice of endpoint for use in regulation i
critical, but note that guideline studies were not designed with this in mind. second,
the biological events controlled by hormones in development not only change as
development proceeds but are different from events controlled by hormones in the
adult. again, guideline endpoints were also not designed with this in mind, especially
since the events controlled by hormones can be both temporally and spatially specifi
the endocrine society has laid out this logic over several years and in several
publications. rather than being extreme views, they represent what is known about
hormones and the chemicals that can interfere with them.
