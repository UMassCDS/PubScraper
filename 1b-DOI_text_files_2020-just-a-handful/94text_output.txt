author information
while the first published study on coaxial electrospinning emerged less than two
decades ago, the process has proved to be a milestone for nanofiber fabrication
because coaxial electrospinning can uniquely manufacture nanofibers from
precursors that are typically considered “nonspinnable’, the process can help society
to fully realize the full potential of applications that nanoscale fibers have to offer. it
provides a straightforward method to fabricate hollow fibers and/or encapsulate
functional agents, including drugs, self-healing agents, and nanoparticles into robust
fabrics. when coaxial electrospinning is used for drug encapsulation, the resulting
fibers show a prolonged release profile, which is more desirable than the burst
release typically achieved by simply mixing a drug and single-nozzle electrospinning,

spinneret is used, multilayered and multifunctional fibers can be obtained, and thus,
their applications are limitless.

due to the applications of fibers in drug delivery, energy storage, and other advanced
fields, coaxial electrospinning has been studied to a great extent at laboratory scale,
and most studies have obtained random depositions of fibers. however, the full
application potential of coaxial electrospinning can only be realized when their large-
scale production is commercially viable. additionally, many applications, including
tissue engineering and separation membranes, would benefit from a scalable way to
manufacture aligned or grids coaxial fibers with controllable interfiber spacings.

a “less-than-ideal” solvent, which may lack biocompatibility or environmental
friendliness. for example, even though dimethylformamide and tetrahydrofuran are
good solvents for many polymers and ideal for electrospinning, these toxic solvents
inhibit the uses of the electrospun fibers. moreover, we must move toward using
green chemistry processes that ideally eliminate the generation of hazardous
substances whenever possible. having a better understanding of how polymer,
solvent, and environmental parameters impact coaxially electrospun fibers holds the
key to improving their large-scale production and implementation across
applications. imaginative, earth-conscious engineers might look toward modified
coaxial setups to enable the production of nanotextiles from recycled polymers
without relying on toxic solvents. we look forward to learning what complex

setups. (a) in conventional coaxial electrospinning, the inner nozzle generally
protrudes out from the outer nozzle, and the flow rate of the sheath should be higher
than the core to facilitate core encapsulation. the sheath precursor is required to be
electrospinnable. (b) in electroblowing, the sheath precursor is a gas. (c) in laes, the
inner nozzle sits within the outer nozzle by at least 1 mm. the flow rate of the core

sheath solution continuously evaporates thus making this process more complicated
than electroblowing. nonetheless, both modified processes have been successfully
used to obtain smooth and uniform nanofibers. the benefits of electroblowing and
laes can also be transferred to multilayered fibers by using a triaxial nozzle (where
the outermost nozzle delivers the gas (189) or solvent (190)). in the sections below,
notable examples of electroblowing and laes will be provided,

6.1. electroblowing

electroblowing combines electrospinning with melt blowing by attaching an air or
gas blowing unit to a single-nozzle electrospinning setup (191) or by flowing a gas

through the outer nozzle of a coaxial spinneret. (173,174) in coaxial electroblowing,
due to the gas flow acting on the jet, there is a shear force in addition to the forces

to facilitate a ~10 times greater production of fibers than singk
electrospinning. (195,196) typically, electroblown fibers are sm lz
obtained from single-nozzle electrospinning, (193) and the dian
decreases as the gas flow rate increases. (174,192,193) this is) tum off this notification

lower voltages because the jet diameter, and consequently, the contact area, is larger
which leads to higher shear forces. (194) on the other hand, at higher applied
voltages, single-nozzle electrospinning results in smaller diameters, and hence, the
effect of the gas-induced shear force decreases as the voltage increases. (194) many
studies have reported that the flow of gas or dry air aids in evaporating the solvent
from the precursor solution. (196,197) for example, when liu et al. (196) employed a
low flow rate of nitrogen gas, the solvent did not fully evaporate, and an
interconnected mesh of fibers was obtained on the collector. however, at increased
gas flow rates, evaporation from the core precursor increased which reduced the
number of interconnected junctions significantly (figure 13). however, contradicting
results, including a lower evaporation of solvent in the presence of gas has also been
reported. (192)

 

figure 13. scanning electron micrographs display the effect that the gas flow rate
used during electroblowing has on fiber morphology. (a) at a lower gas flow rate of

ethanol/dimethylformamide mixture slowed the evaporation rate, yet only
discontinuous and/or beaded fibers were fabricated. however, when the researchers
used a coaxial spinneret featuring an outer nozzle that blew air, continuous fibers
were obtained. the additional elongational force from the air flow through the outer
nozzle of a coaxial spinneret enabled zhmayev et al. (199) to overcome the cohesive
forces to reduce the agglomeration of nanoparticles in polymeric fibers compared to
those spun using a single-nozzle system. the fibers’ potential as an anode in li-ion

laes has a few advantages over single-nozzle electrospinning .

concentration (and in-tum high viscosity) precursor solutions clog single-nozzle
electrospinning spinnerets, in laes, clogging is inhibited because the sheath solvent
first works as a lubricant before it slows down the core solvent evaporation rate,
which mitigates the formation of a solid skin at the droplet surface. (172,176,179)
laes increases the range of polymer concentrations that can be spun. (172,176) for
example, while fibers are not spinnable from very high concentration precursor
solutions, including 35% w/v pvp/ethanol (mw = 360 kg/mol) (172,176) or 30% w/v
eudragit l-100/ethanol (mw = 135 kg/mol), (172), laes has been demonstrated to
spin these solutions into small diameter fibers. in fact, much finer fibers are formed
using laes, because the process slows the evaporation of the core liquid to allow the
jet to stretch more and undergo more rounds of whipping instability before
solidification. (172,176-179)

sheath is too volatile, then it defeats the purpose of using laes
evaporates too quickly. if the sheath solvent volatility is low, the
granted for the jet to undergo whipping instability. the stretchir
whipping instability is supported by the elasticity of the core. hi tum of this notification
nonelastic sheath materials cannot stretch, the sheath breaks up into multiple
segments. if the sheath solvent is miscible with the core, then local mixing of the
sheath and core results in an uneven polymer concentration, and a wide distribution
of fiber diameters is obtained. (172,178,179) additionally, if the polymer
concentration in the segments falls below the entanglement concentration due to
mixing, those segments will have beads. in extreme cases, the solvent in the core
might not evaporate until the fibers reach the collector. to obtain smooth and
uniform fibers, the sheath solvent should evaporate before the onset of the second
round of whipping instability. (178)

 

if the sheath material has a high electrical conductivity, then the amount of charge
induced is high, which increases the coulombic repulsion between the charges and

further stretches the jet, thus the fibers have a thinner diameter. (184,185) in

decreased with voltage. (201) a
unlike conventional coaxial electrospinning, in laes, the flow rate of the sheath is
lower than that of the core. (45,63,73) as the flow rate of the sheath increases, the
onset of whipping instability becomes quicker, i.e., whipping instability starts earlier,
and the length of the straight jet decreases. (177) additionally, the envelope cone of
whipping instability becomes wider. (177) the diameter of the fibers decreases with
the increasing sheath flow rate because the jet remains in a liquid state for a longer
time. (172,177) when the flow rate of the sheath is high (close to the core flow rate),
the sheath breaks into segments and gives rise to fibers with nonuniform diameters.
(122)

the laes process produces bead-free fibers from precursor solutions, because the
rayleigh instability is suppressed as the surface tension of the core-sheath interface

the performance of antimicrobial wound dressings (202) or water treatment

improve their moisture resistance for use in long-term storage applications. (204) as
discussed in section 4.1 ‘biomedical applications’, a burst release effect can be
avoided by fabricating core-sheath nanofibers containing drugs in the core using
conventional coaxial electrospinning; however, that requires the sheath material to be
spinnable. in contrast, laes produced nanofibers can have nonspinnable sheaths
encapsulating the drugs in the core, and this geometry will also mitigate a burst
release. (205,206) one example of this is when yu et al. (205) used a mixture of a
ketoprofen and zein protein as the core and a dilute zein solution as the sheath to
obtain nanofibers with a thin coating of zein, which showed a linear drug release

profile without any burst release effect. (205)

superhydrophobic fibers that have a water contact angle greater than 150° are
important for many industrial textile applications due to their self-cleaning properties
(210) while teflon fabrics could provide superhydrophobicity, the amorphous

that prevents the induction of sufficient charges. han and steckl, (210) as well as

there are two additional modifications to the conventional coaxial apparatus that
capitalize on using “nonspinnable’ sheath solution (78,12) to enable fiber formation,
which we will refer to as electroblowing and liquid-assisted electrospinning (laes). in
electroblowing, which is sometimes called gas-assisted electrospinning, a gas is fed
through the outer nozzle of the coaxial spinneret, (173,174) and resulting fibers are
single-layered as would have been obtained via single-nozzle electrospinning. in
laes, the sheath precursor is a nonelectrospinnable liquid (175) such as a pure
solvent or mixture of solvents, (172,176-183) a salt solution, (184,185) and a
surfactant solution (186,187) (figure 12) and also results in single-layered fibers

by the presence of the sheath due to strain hardening and lower intertacial tension
which suppresses rayleigh instabilities and eliminates beads-on-a-string
morphology. (44) hence, core—sheath nanofibers are obtained, and if desired,
postprocessing (ie., physical or thermal treatment) can be used to stabilize the core
and/or remove the sheath. for example, sun et al. (22) successfully fabricated fibers
from the nonspinnable material palladium acetate, as well as from the low molecular
weight polymer poly(dodecylthiophene), by using polylactic acid (pla) and peo as
the sheath templates, respectively.

 

the range of spinnable polymer concentrations is also expanded using coaxial
electrospinning. for example, in single-nozzle electrospinning,
gelatin/tetrafluoroethylene (tfe) does not electrospin at a 2.5 wt % concentration,
produces beaded fibers at 5 wt %, and does not form fibers at 12.5 wt %. (163)

pdms fibers are desirable because the polymer elastomer has vast applications in
microfluidics, (164) medicine, (165,166) and sensors (30) due to its inert,
nonflammable, nontoxic, biocompatible, and gas-permeable (72) nature
unfortunately, single-nozzle electrospinning of any liquid polymer is challenging,
because the process relies on solvent evaporation. (167) by coaxially electrospinning
pdms/cross-linker as the core precursor and a traditionally “electrospinnable” sheath
precursor, stable pdms fibers can be obtained post-cross-linking; if desired, the
sheath can be removed. (30,72,168-170) coaxial electrospinning also provides an
easy method to tune the properties and functions of pdms fibers. for example,
magnetically charged elastic fibers appropriate for sensing applications can be
fabricated by mixing magnetic nanoparticles into the pdms precursor solution. (169)

polymers is difficult because of their insufficient chain entanglement and their limited
solubility in most solvents. (29,57) single-nozzle spinning of conjugated polymers
can be enabled by adding a linear carrier polymer, such as peo; however, finding
common solvent which dissolves both the carrier and the conjugated polymers is
challenging; and the conductivity of resulting fibers is significantly reduced due to the

adequately miscible and that the solvent should not degrade the drug (figure 8a).
coaxial electrospinning avoids these issues because generally the drug is
incorporated in the core via a compatible solvent, and a different solvent can be
employed for the sheath (1150) (figure 8b). due to the fast electrospinning process,
the sheath solvent, even if incompatible with the drug, does not typically affect the
drug's performance. another advantage of releasing drugs from the core of core—
sheath fibers is that the sheath decreases the diffusion rate, and a sustained drug
delivery can be achieved; (1114) this opposes the initial-burst release common in
single-nozzle electrospun fibers. (151) for example, he et al. (151) fabricated aligned
core-sheath fibers that were comprised of the antibiotic tetracycline hydrochloride
(tch) as the core and the biodegradable fda-approved polymer plla as the sheath

after being immersed in water for 3 days. a faster release of an anti-hiv drug named
maraviroc was achieved by ball et al. (150) when a lower surface tension media was
employed because the fibers were wet efficiently. notably, the ph value of the release
media affects the release rate; it was slower in a basic medium compared to acidic.
this behavior is attributed to the fact the deionization of maraviroc depends on the
ph value, and it becomes hydrophobic above a pk, of 7.8

silicon (si) is one of the most promising anode materials for lithium-ion batteries due
to its high theoretical capacity. (128) however, it has a short life cycle due to many
reasons, including the pulverization of si caused by built-up stresses that are
attributed to the expansion and shrinkage of si volume during cycling. therefore,
nanostructured si exhibits improved life cycle as it has better stress relaxation due to
its small size. however, challenges in producing large-scale nanostructured si has
prevented its use as an anode in li-ion batteries. coaxial electrospinning can be
implemented for large-scale production of coaxial fibers in which si nanoparticles are
encapsulated by pan sheath which can be carbonized later. (128) the resulting
nanoparticle embedded carbon fibers show outstanding electrochemical

performance, and their cycling capacity does not decay significantly for many cycles.

the ability to repair small cracks, maintain structural integrity, and improve the
lifespan of a structure is highly desirable and has been demonstrated using self
healing materials that include polymers and elastomers, as well as metals and
ceramics. (162) the most common method involves encapsulating the healing agent
inside carriers (capsules (162) or nanofibers (117-121), which are dispersed in a
matrix material. when a crack propagates, the matrix material breaks causing the
healing agents to contact a catalyst or curing agent, which heals the crack due to
polymerization or cross-linking (figure 11). due to their small size and large network,
nanofibers are considered a better approach than bulky capsules (~10 um), which
also can reduce structural stability. (119.121) pe

if the sheath cannot sustain atmospheric pressure, the hollow fibers have been
reported to collapse after core extraction. (63,86) for example, halaui et al. (86),
observed that hollow poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-hexafluoropropylene) (pvdf-hfp)
fibers collapsed and buckled after core removal. chan and kotaki (63) obtained
hollow pmma fibers after using mineral oil as a sacrificial core, which was extracted
by socking the fibers in octane for 12 h. while holding the sheath flow rate constant

by using a blend of polymers in the sheath solution and selectively removing one of
them (while the core was simultaneously removed), hollow fibers with porous walls
can be obtained. (73,108) for example, improved catalytic activity was observed after
zhang et al. (108) fabricated hollow nanofibers that were porous after calcination. di
et al. (23) coaxially spun hollow zeolite fibers using a mixture of silicate-1-
nanoparticles and pvp as the sheath precursor solution and paraffin oil as the
sacrificial core. the addition of pvp in the sheath was necessary as silicate-1-
nanoparticles alone are not electrospinnable; after calcination, the core layer as well
as pvp were removed. the researchers noted that if the amount of sacrificial sheath
pvp was too high, then the porous walls would collapse after polymer removal.

core materials, which degrade at lower temperatures (such as pmma or mineral oil),
will be removed before the pan sheath can be stabilized, causing the hollow fibers to
collapse. hence, lee et al. (87-89) used styrene-co-acrylonitrile (san) as the core
precursor and pan or pan/san as the sheath to obtain hcnfs or phcnfs,

3.1. one-step coaxial electrospinning of hollow fibers

it is also possible to obtain hollow fibers using a one-step coaxial electrospinning
process. (92,112,113) dror et al. (112) observed that as-spun fibers were hollow
when a polycaprolactone (pcl) sheath and peo core were coaxially spun. the peo

immiscible polymeric precursor solutions with more volatile sheath precursors lead
to as-spun hollow fibers if the wetting properties are adequate. similarly, when na et
al, (113) used polyvinylidene fluoride (pvdf) dissolved in an acetone/dimethyl
sulfoxide (dmso) mixture and poly(vinyl alcohol) (pva) dissolved in an
ethanol/dmso mixture as the sheath and core, respectively, coaxial electrospinning
resulted in hollow as-spun fibers because pvdf is not soluble in ethanol. the
limitation of this process arises from the strict solvent selection restrictions.

2.1. solutions properties: polymer concentration

in single-nozzle electrospinning, when the concentration of polymer is below the
entanglement concentration, electrospraying occurs, instead of electrospinning. on
the other extreme, when the concentration is very high, the viscosity becomes too
high for electrospinning to occur because the coulombic forces are not able to
overcome the viscous forces. many reports indicate that within a spinnable regime
for single-nozzle electrospinning, increasing the polymer concentration coincides
with an increasing fiber diameter. (53) in general for coaxial electrospinning, it has
been observed that when the polymer concentration of the sheath precursor is low,
the resultant fibers have a beads-on-a-string morphology due to the onset of rayleigh
instability, whereas by increasing the polymer concentration/viscosity of the sheath
precursor, the instabilities are suppressed, and smooth fibers are formed. (24,54)

to the longer polymer/dye diffusion time scale versus the characteristic
electrospinning time scale. numerous researchers reported that the coaxial
electrospinning of miscible solutions resulted in smaller diameter core-sheath fibers
with distinct interfaces due to the negligible interfacial tension between the solutions
(44) on the other hand, a few studies showed that diffusion between the core and
sheath solutions is possible and might even lead to complete mixing. (25,57,59) for
example, when li and xia (25) spun a polyvinylpyrrolidone (pvp)/ethanol core
solution and a mixture of pvp and a titanium alkoxide/ethanolacetic acid sheath
solution, despite removing the pvp postproduction, they generated solid ceramic
fibers with high porosities (figure 6a)

coaxially electrospun using the same sheath solution (titanium alkoxide and
polyvinylpyrrolidone (pvp) in a mixture of ethanol and acetic acid) and varied core
solutions, including (a) pvp in ethanol, (b) polystyrene (ps) in dimethylformamide
(omf)/tetrahydrofuran (thf), and (c) mineral oil. (a) when the core and sheath
precursors were miscible, the two solutions mixed during electrospinning, and solid
fibers were produced. (b) when the core polymer was immiscible with the sheath
polymer, but the solvents were miscible, first there was solution mixing followed by
phase separation of the polymers after the solvents evaporated. the ps rich and ps
poor regions inside the pvp-tio2 matrix gave rise to porous fibers after the ps and
pvp were removed. (c) hollow fibers were obtained when an immiscible core
solution (mineral oil) was employed and removed postspinning. figures 6a-c are

polystyrene (ps) and poly(p-phenylenevinylene) (ppv), as the core and sneatn,
respectively, while the solvents were miscible. on the other hand, when li and xia
(25) used two immiscible solutes, ps and a mixture of pvp/titanium alkoxide, as the
core and sheath, respectively, and obtained porous solid fibers after the polymers
were removed. this behavior is attributed to the miscibility of the core and sheath
solvents; because the solvents were miscible, they diffused into each other and
carried along the ps and pvp. as the solvent evaporated, the concentration of ps and
pvp increased, which caused the immiscible polymers to phase separate (25) (figure
6b). ina third scenario, it is possible that the core and sheath solvents are miscible,
yet the core solute precipitates in the sheath solvent. here, researchers suggested
that the core-sheath fibers had a middle layer that contained both the core and
sheath polymers. (57) an extreme case is displayed in figure 6c when two
completely immiscible solutions are employed, e.g, mineral oil core with a polymer

electrical conductivity of the core and sheath precursors. if the sheath precursor is
more conductive, then the induced charges are located at the sheath-air interface.
(65) in this case, the sheath is the driving precursor, and coulombic forces act on the
sheath causing the sheath to entrain the core. (21,65,66) on the other hand, if the
core precursor is more conductive, then it acts as the driving precursor and drags the
sheath along with it. for example, loscertales et al. (21) obtained droplets of water
coated with olive oil using coaxial electrospraying. due to insufficient conductivity,
olive oil cannot be electrosprayed solo; however, when olive oil was used as the
sheath and a conductive liquid was the core, electrospraying occurred. yu et al. (44)
noted that when the core precursor had a higher conductivity than the sheath, the
electric field might ‘pull’ the core faster than the sheath, and some fibers might not
have a core-sheath morphology.

effect dominates, the diameter may increase or decrease (or even follow
nonmonotonic behavior) with voltage. (71)

 

in the case of coaxial electrospinning, only a small range of applied voltages yields
core-sheath fibers. (58) when the voltage is too low, the jet does not form, and liquid
is dripped from the spinneret (54,58) (figure 7a). when the voltage is increased, a jet
ejects from the sheath, but it does not entrain the core precursor. when voltage is
further increased, a stable jet comprised of both the core and sheath is obtained. (58)
at even higher voltages, more solution is pulled by the electric field (than supplied by
the flow rate) causing the core and sheath solutions to recede into the spinneret, split
up, and form multiple jets. (58,63) the specific range of applied voltages that can be
employed for successful coaxial electrospinning depends on properties of precursor
solution and other experimental parameters. for example, yao et al. (66) were able to

2.5. process parameters: flow rate

when coaxial electrospinning, it is especially important to optimize the flow rate of
each precursor solution. in considering the flow rate of the sheath precursor, faster
rates will increase the overall fiber diameter (54,66) (figure 7c) until an upper limit is
reached that causes the core to segment. (25,44,45,63) if the flow rate of the sheath
is too low, the core will not be fully encapsulated (45,63,73) or it will break up into
diameter and the overall fiber diameter increase (25,41,73,76) (| ~

optimizing the properties of the two precursor solutions is the key to successfully
forming fibers. the outer liquid is typically a polymeric solution, while the inner
precursor does not need to be; it could be a non-newtonian suspension of particles
or even a newtonian liquid. when “nonspinnable” precursors are employed in the
core, they tend to break up into droplets due to rayleigh instabilities. ideally, an
elastic sheath can be used to stabilize the core because it suppresses rayleigh
instabilities, as well as strain hardens the core during jetting. (44) furthermore, the

interfacial tension of core-sheath interface is low which, in turn, reduces the driving

second electric field to extend the polymer chains along the fiber's axis (50) (figure

controlled rate through the inner and outer nozzle, respectively (figure 2a). at the
orifice of the spinneret, a compound droplet is generated, and upon applying voltage,
charges are induced in the droplet. the distribution of these charges depends on the
electrical conductivity of both the core and sheath solutions, as will be discussed
later in the section 2.3, "solutions properties: electrical conductivity. when an
adequate voltage is applied, the sheath precursor is stretched, which imposes a
viscous drag force on the core precursor material thus, entraining the core within the
sheath. the entrainment is aided by protruding the inner nozzle out from the outer
nozzle by half of the radius of the outer nozzle. (40) this stretching and entrainment
causes a compound taylor cone to form from which a compound jet ejects and
subsequently undergoes stretching, whipping instability, and solidification— just as
described in single-nozzle electrospinning. however, here in coaxial electrospinning,
solid core-sheath fibers are formed on the collector. the relative alignment of the

to better understand the coaxial process, we first will provide a brief overview of
single-nozzle electrospinning. typically, the electrospinning process is driven by
applying a voltage across a conductive collector and a conductive spinneret that
supplies the precursor solution at a desired flow rate (figure 1a). applied voltage
induces charges in the precursor solution so that a charged droplet is generated at
the orifice of the spinneret. (20) when the applied voltage is high enough to
overcome the surface tension and viscous forces, coulombic forces stretch the drop
into a conical shape, known as the taylor cone. (31) next, the charged jet is ejected
