conclusions

in this heterogeneous group of adults, we found 3 distinct
classes of motor performance, with the sample clustering
into an expected test score group, a moderate test score
deficiency group, and a severed test score deficiency group.
based on the motor performance tests, we established that
community deployable, easily administered testing could
accurately predict the established clusters of motor
performance.

community deployable, easily administered testing could
accurately predict the established clusters of motor
performance.
results

across the entire sample, 3 latent classes of motor
performance were determined that clustered individuals
with motor performance falling: (1) within predicted values
on most of the tests (expected class), (2) outside predicted
values on some of the tests (moderate class), and (3) outside
werliniodypercenence atthe ‘erpvraverpreacaheablyy
on most of the tests (expected class), (2) outside predicted
values on some of the tests (moderate class), and (3) outside
predicted values on most of the tests (severe class).the ability
to distinguish between the respective classes based on the
percent chance of falling outside predicted values was
achieved using the following community deployable motor
performance tests: 10-meter walk test (22%, 80%, and 100%),
6-minute walk test (14.5%, 37.5%, and 100%), grooved
pegboard test (23%, 38%, and 100%), and modified physical
performance test (3%, 54%, and 96%).

design

 

ixteen tests of limb-specific and whole-body measures of
motor impairment and function were obtained. linear
regression analysis was used to dichotomize performance on
each test as falling within or outside the age- and sex-
predicted values. latent class analysis was used to determine
3 classes of motor performance. the chi-square test of
association and the fisher exact test were used for categorical
variables, and analysis of variance and the kruskal-wallis test
were used for continuous variables to evaluate the
relationship between demographic characteris
classes.
