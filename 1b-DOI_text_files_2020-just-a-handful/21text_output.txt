occlusion handling, and robust klt (rklt) feature
matching to handle deformable tissue structures and
outliers, providing accurate bounding boxes and subpixel
motion estimates of the root tip with smooth trajectories.
jitter in the position or shape of the bounding box from
klt is minimized using the forward-backward error
(fbe) combined with using a robust m-estimator
sample consensus (msac) method for rejecting outliers
in the rklt matches during similarity transformation
estimation. manual interaction is not needed to recover

   

from episodic perturbations when the root is removed
from the imaging station for biological manipulation and
then placed back on the microscopy stage, modeled as a
specialized type of occlusion handling or activity
detection. the simplified radon transform was used to
identify the visibility of the root tip object of interest in
the field-of-view, including filtering frames where the
root may be visible but not the root tip. fbe assists in
the robust matching of multiple bounding boxes near the
root tip to recover from perturbations, motion blur, and

to the six trackers tested, rtip had the lowest average

the standard deviations, i.e. jitter in the localizations, are
higher than rtip. other tested trackers have higher
errors with lower similarity values. therefore, kcf,

siamdw, csrt and tld do not perform well in such
root tip image sequences. moreover, none of the other
tested trackers could adapt automatically to the
perturbation activity in the videos, requiring a manual
stop and restart with a manual reinitialization after the
perturbation. rtip successfully detected the
perturbations and automatically recovered from the
episodic activity, without any manual intervention.
hence, rtip is effective for high-throughput
phenotyping and screening studies of root tip kinematics.

several different metrics are used to evaluate tracker
performance (see table 1). first, velocity estimation
error (vz,,), is the average of all distances between the
algorithm estimated velocity or pixel displacement and
the velocity of the manual ground truth in each frame
(ie. centroid locations). the mean and standard
deviation of the error distances for each method is
shown in table 1. second, the gray level root mean

tracked bbs, is defined as,
due to the deformable nature of the root tip, it is difficult
to create a precise ground truth using manually drawn
bbs in every frame [22]. so the ground truth bbs for
both test sequences were drawn using linear
interpolation between selected key frames. the reference
or key frames were frequently updated to minimize the
growth rate change in the interpolated intervening bbs.
there is some noise in the ground truth since the root tip
growth rate is not constant and the reference boxes are
drawn manually. reference bbs are drawn in the first
frame and each 5th frame before perturbation with
linearly interpolated bbs using these key frames.
similarly, a new initialization bb is drawn in the frame
after perturbation and each 5th frame until the end of the
sequence, with the bbs in-between estimated using

linearly interpolated bbs using these key frames.

the threshold for the rt distance comparisons is
selected as 4 pixels for each sequence, and maximum
number of pixel distances for the fbe used in rklt is 2
pixels. in the similarity transformation estimation, the
threshold of maximum distance for msac is set to 2
pixels. a quality level threshold of at least 0.01 for the
shi-tomasi feature detector was used. rtip is tested on
the timelapse videos in automated mode. some
intermediate results of the rtip tracker with velocity
estimations are shown in the fig. 2. six other wellknown
trackers were also tested on the same sequences
including top performing csrt [9] and siamdw deep
learning tracker with pre-trained weights [10]. other
trackers tested include kcf [11], median flow [17],
multiple instance learning (mil) [21] and tld [12].

rtip was tested on two root sequences, in which
seedlings are grown on square plastic plates containing a
transparent substrate allowing roots to be imaged using
transmitted light. the plate was placed on the stage of a
horizontal, compound microscope and imaged through a
10 objective with a spatial resolution of 2.5 microns
per pixel, and frame size of 2048 x 2448 pixels [6]. the
interval between frames is 30 seconds with a total
imaging time of 40 minutes for an 80 frame video. after
imaging starts, during a perturbation, the plant is
removed from the microscope to cut off the plant shoot
in order to investigate its effect on root growth, then the
root is placed back under the microscope. images were
acquired continuously even while the plant was being
manipulated outside the field-of-view in order to have an
accurate time base. consequently there will be several
frames without the root tip being visible and sometimes
the root tip is not re-placed properly. rtip identifies and
skips past perturbation activity to automatically track

root tips and quantitatively measure kinematic behavior.

filtering

after the initial bb is determined by the air module,
rklt tracking is initialized using the features within the
selected bb extracted by shi-tomasi feature detector.
for each frame, rklt tracks the points from the previous
frame to the current frame by using the given fbe
threshold. the old inliers are updated from previous
feature points with the new inliers selected by rklt. a
similarity transformation between the old and new inliers
is estimated using a variation of random sample
consensus (ransac); m-estimator sample consensus

respect to how well they fit, in addition to giving a
penalty to outliers when calculating the cost function.

rtip for tracking with
perturbations
there are several novel contributions in this study. rtip,
is a fully automated high-throughput root tip tracker for
kinematic measurement and phenotype screening
developed for use with high resolution microscopy
imaging and a complex experimental setup involving
episodic perturbations. to our knowledge, these
conditions cause other state-of-the-art trackers to fail.
rtip handles automatic detection and skipping of the
perturbed frames in the sequence by using a fast and
efficient root tip detection algorithm. occlusion handling

rtip handles automatic detection and skipping of the

perturbed frames in the sequence by using a fast and
efficient root tip detection algorithm. occlusion handling
uses the radon transform and a robust kanade-lucas
tomasi tracker feature matching to detect and localize a
distorted root tip and restart tracking based on forward
backward error and robust outlier handling. root
displacements are estimated with sub-pixel accuracy and
minimal centroid jitter noise.
complex biological protocols for characterizing the
growth kinematics of plant phenotypes now have
additional requirements for accurate video tracking. in
this case the experiments required manual manipulation
of the plant shoot during growth; perturbations that
involved moving the plant so that the root tip becomes
occluded” (i.e. outside the microscope field-of-view)
for an unknown duration. the plant is manipulated then
placed back on the stage and the root can reappear in a
new position. during this interval imaging continues, to

preserve the time-base, so frames may be empty or
blurred, and the continuity of the root tip trajectory is
broken. we developed rtip, a fully automated tracking
tool to measure root tip motion in sequences where the
root is imaged at high enough resolution and where there
are episodic perturbation discontinuities in the position
of the root. rtip estimates a smooth displacement
between bounding boxes (bb) while tracking, producing
accurate velocity estimates. experiments done on two
root tip image sequences show that rtip outperforms six
tested trackers in velocity accuracy, including
discriminative correlation filter tracker (csrt) [9] and
siamdw tracker [10]. although both are high quality
trackers, the shape and size of the bbs change during
tracking, which induces centroid jitter errors and leads to
imprecise velocity estimates compared to rtip. fig. 1
