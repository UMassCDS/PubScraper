abstract

cannabis sativa (cannabis) is a multipurpose plant species
consisting of specific lineages that for centuries has either
been artificially selected for the production of fiber or the
psychoactive drug a®-tetrahydrocannabinol (thc). with the
recent lifting of previous legal restrictions on consuming
cannabis, there has been a resurgence of interest in
understanding and manipulating cannabis genetics to
enhance its compositions. yet, recently developed approaches
are not amenable to high-throughput gene stacking to study
multi-genic traits. here, we demonstrate an efficient
nanoparticle-based transient gene transformation protocol
where multiple gene plasmids can be expressed
imultaneously in intact cannabis leaf cells in a very short
time (5 days). constructs encoding two soybean transcription
factors were co-grafted onto poly-ethylenimine cationic
polymer-modified silicon dioxide-coated gold nanoparticles
(pei-au@sio2). infiltration of the dna-pei-au@sio, into
cannabis leaf tissues resulted in the transcription of both

soybean genes and the localization of fluorescent-tagged
(pei-au@sio3). infiltration of the dna-pei-au@sio, into

cannabis leaf tissues resulted in the transcription of both
soybean genes and the localization of fluorescent-tagged
transcription factor proteins in the nuclei of cannabis leaf
cells including the trichomes, which are the cell types that
iosynthesize valuable cannabinoid and terpene metabolites.
our study exemplifies a rapid transient gene transformation
approach that will be useful to study the effects of gene
stacking in cannabis.

 

 
highlights

nanoparticle-based genetic transformation can
transiently overexpress transgenes in intact
tissues of cannabis sativa.

nanoparticle-based genetic transformation can
simultaneously overexpress multiple transgenes.

cationic polymer-modified silicon-coated gold
nanoparticles are an effective carrier to introduce
foreign dna in cannabis tissues.
