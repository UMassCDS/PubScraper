infections caused by multidrug-resistant (mdr) bacteria presentan ~

global health crisis, and the threat is intensified by the involvement of biofilms.
some biofilm infections involve more than one species; this can further challenge
treatment using traditional antibiotics. nanomaterials are being developed as

alternative therapeutics to traditional antibiotics; here we report biodegradable
polymer-stabilized oil-in-water nanosponges (bns) and show their activity against g
dual-species bacterial biofilms. the described engineered nanosponges

demonstrated broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity through prevention of dual- sate
species biofilm formation as well as eradication of preformed biofilms. thebns|
showed no toxicity against mammalian cells. together, these data highlight the

therapeutic potential of this platform.

this article is part of the nanomedicine advances in infectious diseases special issue.

 

the escalating threat of multidrug-resistant (mdr) bacteria has resulted in
untreatable infections that could kill millions of patients if appropriate measures are
not taken. (1,2), the ability of mdr bacteria to form biofilms further complicates
treatment. (3-5) bacterial biofilm infections frequently occur on wounds, (6=8)
medical implants, (9,10) and indwelling devices. (111) these infections are difficult to
treat because of the complexity of the involved physiologic state alongside the
presence of the biofilm matrix that together protect bacteria against antimicrobial
agents and host immune response; further, biofilms provide a site for selection of
antibiotic resistance. (12-14) some clinically relevant biofilms, such as wound
infections, typically involve two or more bacterial species, (15,16) adding an

interactions, including metabolic connections and spatial organizauun, are mvuiveu
(20) synergistic interactions between some species can occur and there can be
transfer of resistance genes and quorum sensing, which can lead to more resistant
biofilms. (19) the composition of the extracellular polymeric substances (eps)
matrix may be different in mono- compared to multispecies biofilms, and this can
provide a stronger barrier against antibiotic penetration. (18)

 

current strategies to combat multispecies biofilms focus on antibiotic cocktails or
use of antibiotics with broad-spectrum activity, meaning they are able to provide
activity against more than one species. (17) these therapeutic strategies can be
associated with increased incidence of antibiotic resistance development and off-
target effects, such as hepatotoxicity or nephrotoxicity. (17) these challenges are
amplified by the decline in the number of new antibiotics entering the clinic,
contributing to the urgency for developing novel antimicrobial therapies. (20)

functionalities, allow them to access multiple antimicrobial mor lz

biomolecules, enabling multivalent interactions with bacteria. (24) further, their high
surface-to-volume ratios allow high therapeutic loading, rendering them efficient
delivery vehicles for antimicrobial agents. although antibiotics have specific bacterial
targets and are prone to resistance development, nanomaterials exhibit several

antimicrobial mechanisms novel to bacteria and hence less susceptible to resistance
acquisition. (23)

nanomaterials incorporating plant-derived essential oils have emerged as a
promising resource to combat bacterial biofilm infections. essential oils exhibit
broad-spectrum activity against mdr bacteria. (24) however, low aqueous solubility
and stability limit their widespread application. polymeric nanomaterials have shown
efficient delivery of essential oils to bacteria enclosed within an eps matrix. (25-27)
previously, our group reported the use of biodegradable polymers to create

nanosponges that act as nanocarriers of essential oils. (28,29) the polymer scaffold

we report here the activity of oil-in-water polymer nanosponges against dual-species
biofilm models of clinical isolates. multiple biofilm combinations were tested,
including metticillin-resistant staphylococcus aureus (mrsa)-pseudomonas

microscopy studies revealed that nanosponges effectively pens

broad-spectrum antibiofilm activity of nanosponges against complex dual-species
bacterial biofilms, offering a promising strategy for complex wound biofilm
treatment.

 

biodegradable nanosponges (bns) were fabricated as previously described (28)
through emulsification of synthetically engineered poly(oxanorborneneimide)
polymers and carvacrol, the major antimicrobial component of oregano oil. (32) the
poni-gmt (poly(oxanorborneneimide)-backbone, guanidinium, maleimide, and
tetraethylene glycol monomethyl ether moieties) scaffold possesses three structural
features: (1) a cationic guanidinium moiety to enhance interaction with negatively
charged bacterial membranes and eps matrix; (33) (2) a tetraethylene glycol
monomethyl ether moiety to enhance amphiphilicity, allowing polymers to self-
assemble around the oil core; and (3) a maleimide moiety to conjugate with disulfide

containing dithiol—disulfide (disulfanediyldi(ethane-2,1-diyl) bis(11z___.
addition reactions. ine resulting cross-linked structure allows t

nanosponges and imparts degradability to the nanosponges at

(dls) (figure $1). the generation of cationic nanosponges, attr;
units, was validated by zeta (2) potential measurement, averaginy av verry y iyuic

we studied the antibiofilm activity of bns against multiple mono- and dual-species
bacterial biofilms using clinical isolates of pathogenic gram-positive and gram-
negative bacteria. we focused our antimicrobial studies on two dual-species biofilms
(1) mrsa (grarr-positive) and p. aeruginosa (gram-negative); and (2) mrsa and a
baumannii (gram-negative). mrsa and p. aeruginosa are frequent causes of wound
infections, often together, as mixed-species biofilms. (34,35) dual-species biofilms
formed by these two pathogens are more resistant to conventional antimicrobial
therapy than monomicrobial biofilms, often leading to failure of treatment. (36), also,
a, baumanniiis associated with severe wound infections and often generate highly
resistant mixed-species biofilms with other bacterial species. (30) the ability of bns
to prevent formation of dual-species biofilms was first investigated. bns effectively

eftective biomim eradication requires penetration and accumulé

within the bacteria for both monospecies (figures $3 and s4) and dual-species

biofilms (figure 1), highlighting their potential to be effective antibiofilm agents

compared the mbbc values of bns between mono- and dual-species biofilms of
mrsa idrl-6169 and p. aeruginosa cd-1006, while also assessing gentamicin, a
broad-spectrum aminoglycoside antibiotic. as shown in figure 2b, there was no
change in mbbc observed for bns (240 mg/l) when treating dual-species compared
to monospecies biofilms, demonstrating effective treatment of the dual-species
biofilms. in contrast, a 4-fold increase in mbbc was detected for gentamicin when
treating the dual-species biofilms (1024 mg/l) as compared to p. aeruginosa only
(256 mg/l), and a 128-fold increase when compared to mrsa only (8 mg/l). the
increased tolerance to gentamicin underlines the challenge for traditional antibiotics
posed by multispecies biofilms resulting from cooperative interactions between
species within biofilms. (19) in contrast, the inherent broad-spectrum nature of the
bns made this platform effective against dual-species biofilms, providing a

next, the activity of our nanosponges against preformed 2-day-old dual-species
biofilms was evaluated. established biofilms of mrsa-p aeruginosa and mrsa-a
baumannii were treated with different concentrations of bns for 3h. subsequently,
biofilm viability was determined using alamar blue assay. as shown in figure 3, bns
eradicated bacteria within the biofilms in a dose-dependent manner. notably, bns
maintained activity in either mono- or dual-species settings

finally, we investigated bns biocompatibility with mammalian nih 373 fibroblasts,
as such cells would be expected to be present at the site of infected wounds.
fibroblasts play a critical role in wound healing by creating new extracellular matrix
(ecm). (38) fibroblasts were treated with bns for 3 h using the same concentrations
active against biofilms. as shown in figure 4, bns demonstrated low toxicity toward
fibroblast cells at therapeutically relevant concentrations. given that bns effectively
eliminate dual-species pathogenic biofilms while having a minimum effect on
mammalian fibroblasts, these results suggest that bns should be further evaluated
as a potential approach to treat wound biofilm infections.

showed increased tolerance against therapeutics, our nanosponges showed no
diminished activity in dual-species biofilm settings. taken together, this nanosponge
platform provides a promising strategy to combat difficult-to-treat mixed-species
bacterial biofilms with the potential to revolutionize the treatment of bacterial
infections
