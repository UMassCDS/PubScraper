ays. most research has focused on how power dynamics lead to aggressi

havior, but individuals may also behave submissively by holding back,
jing in, or disengaging. our primary aim was to investigate who respond:
lower power with submissive behavior during marital conflict. lower
rceived power relative to the partner during conflict was associated with
eater submission for both women and men, but this association was
ronger for women than men and was especially pronounced for women
10 held more traditional gender role beliefs. this pattern is consistent wi
e acceptance of structural differences in power, and associated

 

ceptance of the authority granted to men within traditional gender role
ructures. our findings complement prior work showing that men respon

 

low power with aggression (overall et al,, 2016) by demonstrating that ic
wer is also linked to submissive behaviors that will also have important
nsequences. although these two behavioral responses to low power ma
pear inconsistent, assertive/aggressive responses are independent of
bmissive behaviors (overall & mcnulty, 2017) and involve the presence c
ressive) behavior rather than the absence of (submissive) behavior.

nerally, how power processes unfold in any given situation will depend c
range of individual differences and social norms that moderate power-
lated effects, such as gender, gender role beliefs, personality, and
rerpersonal goals, and the extent to which norms in the broader culture

bmission may impede their perceived ability to live up to traditional

 

nder roles, and over time, such experiences may erode relationship

derstanding power dynamics in romantic relationships is critical becaus

balances in power can lead to poorer relationship functioning (simpson.
2015). furthermore, similar dynamics are likely to play out in power-

 

levant interactions across domains (e.g., work and educational settings).
ntral question for future work is whether submissive behaviors reinforce

espite the novelty of these theoretically consistent findings and the
logically valid methods examining marital interactions, this work has
veral limitations. our longitudinal nonexperimental design inevitably
nits causal conclusions. although we focused on individuals’ perceptions

 

lavior because of difficulties in observers’ detecting internal, inexpressiv
haviors, such as giving in and holding back (low et al., 2018; thomson et
sistance) to traditional gender roles is associated with women respondin

cluding individuals who strongly endorse traditional gender role beliefs c

yuples participated in three sessions: time 1 (married <7 months), time:
pproximately 19 months after time 1), and time 3 (approximately 37
onths after time 1). at each session, couples talked for 15 min about an
portant unresolved conflict. before the discussion, both spouses
parately nominated three topics of unresolved disagreement and rated

 

intensity of their prior discussions of that topic (1 = not at all, 7 = very
fense). research assistants selected a topic for discussion that had been

e items capture (1) women’s traditional gender role of being responsible

) men’s traditional gender role as economic provider and associated

nphasis on men's greater competence. examples include (1) “women are
ter suited than men to childcare” and (2) “human beings evolved so tha
en have authority in the family” (1 = strongly agree, 5 = strongly disagree;

ticipants also rated 6 items assessing submission, including how much

ildrearing. thus, gender and gender role norms support differences in
ructural power in society, with men generally holding more structural or
cietal-level power (connor et al., 2017; glick & fiske, 1999; hausmann et
2014).

 

 

wer can be usurped by male partners exerting the broader authority
signed by their dominant social role, which provides a basis to resist and

wer relative to their partner within a specific conflict interaction may be
ore likely to respond in accordance with pervasive and often implicit,
cietal pressures to behave in ways that conform to prescribed gender ro

lemers, 2018; wood & eagly, 2010). thus, on average, women (comparec
