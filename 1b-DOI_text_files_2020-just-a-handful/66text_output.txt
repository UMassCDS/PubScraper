discussion

in this study, we report for the first time an important role for pdi in the
modulation of mast cell homeostasis and mast cell-mediated allergic
responses. collectively, our data demonstrate that mast cells express pdi
both constitutively and during ige-mediated activation. the presence of pdi
was also detected in the intestines of enterally-challenged allergic mice.
blockade of pdi activity at both the cellular and physiological levels resulted
in a profound suppression of mast cell-mediated responses including
decreased mast cell proliferative capacity, reduced secretion of mast cell
cytokines, and protection from the development of food allergy.

pdi, a multifunctional er thiol isomerase, is a 55-kda protein that is the
prototype of the pdi family of proteins. the pdi family comprises of 21
members (44). pdi family members play a critical role in the regulation of
protein folding and assembly, both during physiological homeostasis as well
as in conditions of cellular stress (15). increased generation of unfolded or
misfolded proteins during er stress activates the upr, resulting in reduced
protein synthesis, an increase in the er curvature, and the activation of pdi
and other chaperones (45, 46)

the development of inflammation is thought to activate the upr, resulting in
the enhancement of protein synthesis and folding, and consequently
increased pdi activity (47). complex allergens in particular, such as food-
derived proteins, have the potential to induce er stress and upregulate the
function of pdi family members (48). despite this, the effects of pdi on
immune cells has been poorly studied, and very little is known regarding its
functions during allergic inflammation. interestingly, a recent study
demonstrated a critical role for a pdi family member, erp57 in airway allergic
responses (49). the expression of erp57 was increased in lung epithelial cells
in both allergen-challenged patients and in mice. deletion of erp57 in house
dust-mite-challenged mice resulted in decreased airway inflammation and
hyperreactivity, accompanied by decreased disulfide bridges in eotaxin,
epidermal growth factor, and periostin in the lungs of allergic animals. these
data suggest that modulation of pdi activity in vivo can influence the
outcome of allergic sensitization and challenge.

outcome of allergic sensitization and challenge.

we hypothesized that food-derived substances may have the potential to
modulate mast cell responses during food allergy by inhibiting the activity of
pdi. we have previously shown that widely consumed dietary components
such as curcumin can suppress mast cell activation and inhibit the
development of food allergy in mice (4). the suppression of mast cells by
curcumin in this model was dependent on the inhibition of nf-kb activation
(4). similarly, lee et al. also described anti-allergic effects of curcumin on
mast cells (7). they found that the inhibitory effects of curcumin on cultured
mast cells were mediated via inhibition of syk kinase activity. in this study, we
report the pdi inhibitory activity of curcumin, suggesting another potential
mechanism for its anti-allergic effects. since pdi is involved in the formation
of disulfide bonds which is critical for the folding of many proteins including
transcription factors, it is likely that the previously described suppression of
proteins by curcumin and other dietary substances occurs via inhibition of
pdi catalytic activity. in this context, in addition to curcumin, we
demonstrate that another well-known dietary pdi modulator, rutin, also
inhibits mast cell activation in our model. this is consistent with reported
observations where quercetin and its derivatives, have been demonstrated to
have potent anti-pdi activity in vivo in various clinical trials (27, 28). in this
context, our data suggest that anti-inflammatory compounds such as
curcumin and the flavonoids which are iihiauitous in varinnis tynes of diets
observations where quercetin and its derivatives, have been demonstrated to
have potent anti-pdi activity in vivo in various clinical trials (27, 28). in this
context, our data suggest that anti-inflammatory compounds such as
curcumin and the flavonoids, which are ubiquitous in various types of diets
including fruits, vegetables, wines and teas, also have the potential to alter
pdi activity in human mast cells and suppress the development of allergic
inflammation (27, 28, 50). while we did not specifically examine human mast
cells or pdi expression in these cells in this study, it will be important to
determine whether pdi has similar effects on ige-mediated activation in
human cells. in this context, interestingly, quercetin and other polyphenols
have been shown to modulate human mast cell activity in other studies (51,
52)

our data suggests that allergen-induced mast cell activation may be a likely
target of pdi-dependent modulation by dietary substances, thereby
mitigating the overall magnitude of the allergic response. dietary pdi
modulators may possibly attenuate the activity of extracellular or cell surface
pdi on mast cells and other immune cells, thereby suppressing their overall
activation, and decreasing the production of proinflammatory mediators.
this was evidenced by treatment with various pdi inhibitors, which
suppressed the ige-mediated activation of mast cells and inhibited their
degranulation and cytokine secretion. furthermore, treatment with pacma-
31, an orally bioactive, irreversible inhibitor of pdi suppressed mast cell
responses both in cell culture and during the development of food allergy,
suggesting that therapeutic targeting of pdi in allergic patients may prove to
degranulation and cytokine secretion. furthermore, treatment with pacma-
31, an orally bioactive, irreversible inhibitor of pdi suppressed mast cell
responses both in cell culture and during the development of food allergy,
suggesting that therapeutic targeting of pdi in allergic patients may prove to
be of benefit. interestingly, pdi inhibition also attenuated the long-term
survival of bmmcs, suggesting that modulation of pdi activity in vivo can
influence the homeostasis of mast cells. nonetheless, the effects of pdi
inhibition on mast cell degranulation and cytokine secretion were unrelated
to its effects on cell viability, as no significant effects on cellular viability were
observed within the first 48 h, i.e. the percentages of live and dead cells
between untreated and treated groups were comparable at this time point
(figures 3c and 4f)

in this report, we demonstrate for the first time the presence of pdi
molecules on the surface of mast cells. here, their enhanced extracellular
activity (which can be blocked by pdi inhibitors) during mast cell activation
may modulate downstream cellular events, contributing to changes in
molecular and cellular function. in this context, cell-surface specific pdi has
been found to be important for the functions of hepatocytes, endothelial
cells, and platelets (27, 53). furthermore, pdi has also been shown to be
secreted into cell culture supernatants, which we did not ascertain in these
studies (reviewed in (15)). it is thought that in these locations, pdi assists with
redox protein folding, intramolecular thiol-disulfide exchanges and
isomerization activities, as a result of highly specific interactions with various
substrates. future studies aimed at dissecting the contributions of both
extracellular and intracellular pdi to mast cell activation will shed further
redox protein folding, intramolecular thiol-disulfide exchanges and
isomerization activities, as a result of highly specific interactions with various
substrates. future studies aimed at dissecting the contributions of both
extracellular and intracellular pdi to mast cell activation will shed further
light on the mechanisms by which pdi enhances mast cell responses. in
particular, the effects of pdi catalytic activity on the formation of disulfide
bonds in various proteins produced by mast cells or that activate them will
be important to characterize. in this context, recent studies have elucidated
novel roles for the disulfide dimer histamine-releasing factor (hrf) in mast.
cell-mediated allergic responses (54, 55). hrf forms dimers which can
cross-link with ige on basophils and mast cells and induce the secretion of
enhanced levels of histamine, il-4 and il-13. both increased levels of hrf-
reactive ige as well as increased numbers of hrf dimers were found in a
recently described study of mast cell-mediated food allergy (54, 55)
similarly, patients with food allergy also had increased levels of serum hrf-
reactive ige and blockade of hrf function in the mouse model as well as
oral immunotherapy in patients inhibited the allergic response (54, 55). in
light of our data above, it is possible that the generation of hrf dimers in
vivo may depend on pdi activity, resulting in the enhanced secretion of these
proteins during allergic responses and the amplification of mast cell-
mediated reactions.

the effects of pdi may also extend beyond its known isomerization activities.
for example, recent studies demonstrate that pdi can increase the levels of
reactive oxygen species (56) thus directly inducing oxidative stress and

the effects of pdi may also extend beyond its known isomerization activities.
for example, recent studies demonstrate that pdi can increase the levels of
reactive oxygen species (56) thus directly inducing oxidative stress and
apoptosis, as well as activate transcription factors, such as nf- kb and ap-1
(57). in this context, we have previously demonstrated that the protective
effects of curcumin on mast cells are mediated via inhibition of nf-kb
activation (4), whereas another study demonstrated that flavonoids such as
rutin can inhibit reactive oxygen species in mast cells (51). as such, further
analysis of the effects of pdi inhibition on these and other parameters in
mast cells will help elucidate the roles of pdi in these areas.

lastly, this study demonstrates that pdi blockade has a profound effect on
mast cell homeostasis (intestinal mast cell numbers), activation (mmcp-1
levels), and mast cell-mediated effects such as allergic diarrhea in the ige
and mast cell-dependent model of ova-induced food allergy. however,
although we have not examined other immune cell types in this study, it is
likely that the activity of pdi family members is also altered in other cells
during allergic responses. particularly, our data in figure 9 demonstrate that
ova-specific splenic responses are also suppressed in the food alleray
model, thereby implicating a role for pdi in the modulation of allergen-
specific t cells. future studies aimed at examining the effects of pdi on
various immune cells during food allergy are therefore necessary to clarify
the differential effects of pdi modulation on immune cells and their
contribution to the development of food allergy.

various immune cells during food allergy are therefore necessary to clarify
the differential effects of pdi modulation on immune cells and their
contribution to the development of food allergy.

taken together, our data suggest that pdi and its related family members
may play vital roles in the regulation of mast cell activation during the
allergic response, and that in vivo blockade of their activity may prove to be
of therapeutic benefit in patients with mast cell-mediated disorders.

allergic responses and its inhibition can modulate mast cell function during

of pdi family members in the intestines of allergic mice, we assessed the

expression of these genes was observed in the intestines of both controls

opposed to decreased expression (figure 8f)

pdi inhibition suppresses mast cell responses in a mouse model of food
allergy

our data above demonstrate a significant role for pdi during mast cell
activation and function in cell culture. to ascertain whether blocking pdi
activity in vivo will have similar effects on mast cell responses, we assessed
the effects of pacma-31 treatment in a mast cell-mediated model of
intestinal food anaphylaxis. briefly, mice were sensitized and challenged with
the egg allergen ova as previously described (24) (figure 7a). beginning one
day prior to challenge with ova, some groups of mice were orally gavaged
with pacma-31 suspended in 1% carboxy methyl cellulose as previously
described (4) (figure 7a). as observed in figure 7b, ova-sensitized and
challenged mice developed profuse diarrhea in comparison with ova-
sensitized controls. this correlated with an increase in ova-specific ige
production as enumerated in the serum (figure 7c). in contrast, pacma-31-
gavaged animals did not develop diarrhea and exhibited decreased serum
ova-ige levels (figures 7b, c)

the levels of cytokines in supernatants were assessed. as observed in figures
6b-d, the levels of tnf-a, il-6, and il-13 were suppressed in the pacma-
31-treated samples compared to untreated controls, suggesting that
inhibition of activation-induced pdi activity may be sufficient to alter mast
cell responses in vivo. furthermore, inhibition of pdi was sufficient to
attenuate the suppression of both pre-formed mediators such as tnf-a as
well as de novo synthesized cytokines such as il-13. to further confirm the
effects of inhibition of cell surface pdi, bmmcs were treated with an anti-pdi
mab (abcam), followed by activation via ige and antigen (figure 6e). as
expected, extracellular pdi blockade also resulted in suppression of mast
cell-derived il-13 as seen in figure 6e. lastly, to determine whether pdi
blockade by pacma-31 during er stress can inhibit the production of mast
cell-derived cytokines, bmmcs were cultured with brefeldin a just before
activating with dnp-bsa as described in figure 1. pre-treatment of cells with
pacma-31 significantly attenuated the capacity of bmmcs to produce il-13
and tnf-a as shown in figures 6f to h. furthermore, the median
fluorescence intensity of both cytokines was also decreased in pacma-31-
treated cells (figures 6g-i). these data therefore strongly suggest that ige-

the expression of the high affinity receptor for ige, fceri, on resting and
activated bmmcs. as observed in figure 6a, resting bmmcs express high
levels of unbound fceri. in contrast, pre-incubation with pacma-31
significantly decreased the expression of the receptor in bmmcs. in activated
mast cells, the overall intensity of unbound fcr! expression was decreased
as would be expected as a consequence of saturation by ige molecules.
however, this was further reduced in pacma-31-exposed and ige-activated
bmmcs,
the secretion and extracellular activity of pdi in endothelial cells and
platelets is well-established (16, 40, 42, 43), but its extracellular role in mast
cells is unknown. to determine whether pdi can be detected on the surface
of mast cells, we assessed the secretion of pdi using flow cytometry. as seen
in figures 5b, c, extracellular pdi can be detected on both resting and
activated mast cells, with increased expression being observed a few min
after activation. quantification of the median fluorescence intensity of pdi
expression revealed a significant increase in the presence of this molecule

on the surfaces of cells activated with ige and antigen (figure 5c). these
data therefore suggest that extracellular pdi is present on the cell
membranes of resting mast cells, where it has the potential to modulate
cellular function via its enzymatic activity. the secretion of extracellular pdi
is further enhanced soon after ige activation has occurred. next, to examine
the levels of intracellular pdi protein in mast cells, we evaluated its presence
in unactivated and ige-activated mast cells six h after ige-activation had
occurred. as observed in figure 5a above, intracellular pdi was detected
both constitutively and in activated mast cells by flow cytometry (figure 5d).
a small but demonstrable increase was observed in activated cells, although
the overall levels appeared to be similar (figure 5d), consistent with
observations of intracellular pdi levels in other cell types (16, 36, 38-40).
this was also confirmed by western blot analysis (figure 5e). these data
therefore demonstrate that pdi is secreted on the surfaces of mast cells,
where they may be a likely target of naturally occurring food-derived pdi
inhibitors

enhanced secretion of pdi in activated mast cells

our data above demonstrates a significant reduction in mast cell functional
activity and activation-induced events such as cytokine production when
exposed to pdi inhibitors, suggesting that pdi enzymatic activity is induced
in mast cells after activation has occurred. this is consistent with the known
effects of pdi during cellular activation in various cells. interestingly, several
recent studies have also identified novel functional roles for extracellular
secreted pdi in various cells (16, 36-40). pdi bound to integrins on the
surfaces of these cells has been shown to exert extracellular effects and
modulate cellular function. as such, we wondered whether extracellular pdi
is also secreted by mast cells during ige-activation and whether cell-surface
‘secreted pdi in various cells (16, 56-40). pdi bound to integrins on the
surfaces of these cells has been shown to exert extracellular effects and
modulate cellular function. as such, we wondered whether extracellular pdi
is also secreted by mast cells during ige-activation and whether cell-surface
pdi may likely be a target of our pdi inhibitors

to further explore the role of pdi and evaluate its activity during mast cell
activation, we assessed the expression of pdi in resting and ige-activated
bmmcs by quantitative pcr. pdi is the gene originally identified as the b-
subunit of prolyl-4-hydroxylase (p4hb) that catalyzes the formation of 4-
hydroxyproline in collagen (reviewed in (41)). we therefore assessed the
expression of the p4hb gene in resting and activated mast cells. as seen in
figure 5a, basal expression of the p4hb gene may be observed in resting
bmmcs consistent with its role as an intracellular chaperone. however, no
further increase in gene expression was observed in ige-activated bmmcs a
few h after activation, suggesting that the intracellular transcriptional levels
of pdi remain stable after activation has occurred (figure 5a). this is not
surprising as it is the increased enzymatic activity of pdi and not its cellular
expression levels that contribute to changes in cellular function.

suppression of mast cell activation and function by the pdi-selective
inhibitor, pacma-31.

lastly, to verify that pdi plays an important role in these processes, we used
a pdi selective compound, shown to have potent anti-pdi activity in animal
studies. recently, a class of propynoic acid carbomyl methyl amides
(pacmas) was shown to have broad-spectrum activity against various cancer
cell lines (18, 35). of these, the small molecule compound, pacma-31, was
shown to have irreversible activity against pdi (icgo of 10m in animal
studies (35)), forming a covalent bond with active site cysteines, and
exhibited in vivo activity with oral bioavailability in a mouse xenograft model
of ovarian cancer (35). furthermore, pacma-31 has a greater selectivity for
pdi over other thiol isomerases compared to bacitracin. we therefore
investigated whether pacma-31 would also inhibit pdi in our confirmatory
assays and assessed its effects on mast cell activation and function in our

 

 

   

pdi over other thiol isomerases compared to bacitracin. we therefore
investigated whether pacma-31 would also inhibit pdi in our confirmatory
assays and assessed its effects on mast cell activation and function in our
model. as observed in figure 4a, pacma-31 is a potent inhibitor of pdi in
cell-free enzymatic assays and inhibits the insulin reduction catalytic activity
of pdi in a dose-dependent manner. a comparison of the pdi inhibitory
activity of pacma-31 with curcumin is shown in supplementary figure 2. to
further investigate whether pacma-31 has similar dose-dependent effects
on functional studies in mast cells, we treated bmmcs with various
concentrations (lom and 30m) of pacma-31. as observed in the case of
bacitracin and rutin above, pre-treatment of bmmcs with pacma-31
overnight (figures 4b-e) resulted in a significant suppression of mast cell
activation as evidenced by reduced mast cell cytokine production (figures
4b—d) and decreased overall mast cell survival (figure 4e)
to further investigate the effects of pdi inhibition on mast cells, we also
examined the effects of bacitracin and rutin exposure on bmmc proliferation
and survival as previously described (24). bmmcs were cultured with il-3 and
scf, along with various concentrations of bacitracin, rutin, or vehicle. their
proliferation and/or survival was followed for 5 days and live cells were
enumerated using trypan blue exclusion. as observed in figure 3c and data
not shown, co-culture with bacitracin or rutin for 5 days, resulted in an
overall dose-dependent decrease in bmmc proliferation and survival,
suggesting that pdi activity may regulate mast cell homeostasis and
proliferation possibly by modulating intracellular protein folding during cell
growth. this is consistent with the known roles of pdi as an important
housekeeping protein necessary for cell survival (30). however, treatment
with both pdi inhibitors had no effects on cell viability and proliferation for at
least up to 48 h (for the 104m doses) or longer (for the 1m doses) after
treatment at these time noints nercentaaes of live cells were comnarable
housekeeping protein necessary for cell survival (30). however, treatment
with both pdi inhibitors had no effects on cell viability and proliferation for at
least up to 48 h (for the 104m doses) or longer (for the 1m doses) after
treatment. at these time points, percentages of live cells were comparable
between groups and no changes in percentages of dead cells, approximately
10%, were observed. this confirms that the effects of the pdi inhibitors on
ige-mediated mast cell activation described above are not due to cell death
but reduction of catalytic activity consistent with reported observations in
other (27)

rutin pre-treatment modulates cytokine secretion in ige-activated mast
cells

while bacitracin is widely used in research as a pdi antagonist, its clinical use
in vivo is hampered by its low membrane permeability and adverse side
effects such as nephrotoxicity (27). to therefore further confirm that pdi
plays an important role in mast cell activation, we utilized a second well-
established inhibitor of pdi, rutin (icsq 6 um in insulin reductase assays (27)),
in human studies (28, 33, 34). the polyphenolic flavonoid, quercitin-3-
rutinoside (rutin) was recently shown to be a potent small molecule inhibitor
of pdi (20). quercetin and its derivatives such as rutin are ubiquitously
present in many fruits and vegetables (27), suggesting that they may have the
potential to modulate mast cell function in a manner similar to that observed
with curcumin (4). to therefore further investigate the importance of pdi
during mast cell activation and confirm the effects observed above with
bacitracin, we also cultured bmmcs with increasing concentrations of rutin,
and assessed the production of mast cell-derived cytokines. as observed
above, pre-treatment with increasing concentrations of rutin, also
suppressed cytokine gene expression (supplementary figures 1d-f) and the
bacitracin, we also cultured bmmcs with increasing concentrations of rutin,
and assessed the production of mast cell-derived cytokines. as observed
above, pre-treatment with increasing concentrations of rutin, also
suppressed cytokine gene expression (supplementary figures 1d-f) and the
production of mast cell-derived cytokines in a dose-dependent manner
(figures 2e-h), suggesting that mast cell activity during immune responses
in vivo may be modulated by the fine-tuning of cell-specific pdi activity.

pre-treatment with bacitracin or rutin suppresses release of pre-formed
mediators and influences long-term cell survival

our observations above demonstrating a dose-dependent suppression of
cytokine expression and secretion by pdi inhibitors are consistent with well-
described roles of pdis as molecular chaperones during the intracellular
generation of various proteins. to further determine whether pdi is also
involved during mast cell degranulation and the release of pre-formed
mediators, we examined cell culture supernatants immediately after
activation with dnp-bsa, and assessed the secretion of the enzyme b-
hexosaminidase (b-hex) as previously described (24). as observed in figure
3a, ige-mediated activation induced the secretion of b-hex into cell culture
supernatants 15 min later compared with unactivated controls (figure 3a). in
contrast, pre-treatment with increasing concentrations of either bacitracin
or rutin, resulted in decreased secretion of this enzyme in activated cells
(figure 3a). these data suggest that inhibition of pdi can suppress the
release of pre-formed mediators from mast cell granules after ige-mediated
activation furthermore the total cellular r-hex content was also decreased
or rutin, resulted in decreased secretion of this enzyme in activated cells
(figure 3a). these data suggest that inhibition of pdi can suppress the
release of pre-formed mediators from mast cell granules after ige-mediated
activation. furthermore, the total cellular b-hex content was also decreased
in cells treated with pdi inhibitors (data not shown), suggesting that pdi
inhibition may also block b-hex production. however, a much smaller effect
on the extent of intrinsic mast cell degranulation was observed (figure 38)

bacitracin pre-treatment modulates cytokine gene expression and
secretion in ige-activated mast cells

the ubiquitous expression of pdi and its importance in protein folding
presents a major challenge to examination of its activity using gene
knockdown strategies. knockdown of pdi is lethal in yeast and mammalian
cell lines (30) and to date, no viable strains of pdi knockout mice exist. as
such, the functions of pdi both in vitro and in vivo have often been studied
using various small molecule inhibitors of pdi as well as pdi-blocking
antibodies. to further investigate the role of pdi during mast cell activation
and function, we therefore assessed the effects of pre-treatment with
various pdi inhibitors on mast cell cytokine production after activation with
laf and antiaen we exolored the effects of three well-established pdi
antibodies. to further investigate the role of pdi during mast cell activation
and function, we therefore assessed the effects of pre-treatment with
various pdi inhibitors on mast cell cytokine production after activation with
ige and antigen. we explored the effects of three well-established pdi
inhibitors to verify they all had the same effect and corroborate that the
process was pdi-dependent. the following stepwise approach was utilized
assessment of mast cell function using classic pdi inhibitors such as
bacitracin, examination of the effects of clinically validated pdi inhibitors
such as rutin on mast cells, and confirmation of pdi activity in mast cells
using selective pdi inhibitors such as pacma-31.

the effects of pdi in cell studies have historically been studied using the
topical peptide antibiotic, bacitracin (27, 31). bacitracin is a well-studied,
non-selective inhibitor of pdi and blocks pdi function in the high
micromolar range (ic59 of zum in insulin reductase assays) inhibiting
disulfide bond formation (32). bacitracin is also non cell-permeable (27).
therefore, its effects on pdi catalytic activity maybe mediated via inhibition
of cell surface pdi. to examine the effects of bacitracin pre-treatment on
ige-mediated activation in mast cells, bmmcs were pre-treated with
increasing concentrations of the drug overnight prior to activation via ige
and antigen. the dose-dependent effects of bacitracin pre-treatment on
cytokine were then assessed. as expected, ige-mediated activation of
bmmcs resulted in the enhanced secretion of il-4, il-6, il-13, and tnf-a
into cell culture supernatants (figures 2a—d). in contrast, pre-treatment with
various doses of bacitracin, resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of
cytokine were ten assessed. as expected, ige-mediated activation or
bmmcs resulted in the enhanced secretion of il-4, il-6, il-13, and tnf-a

mast cell-mediated cytokine production by inhibiting the activity of pdi
during ige-induced activation. similar effects were also observed on the
induction of cytokine gene transcription (supplementary figures 1a-c)
these data therefore suggest that inhibition of pdi activity can suppress the
production of cytokines by ige-activated mast cells. furthermore, they also
strongly implicate a role for extracellular pdi activity, as bacitracin is a non-
cell membrane permeable pdi inhibitor.

results

curcumin inhibits protein disulfide isomerase activity and suppresses ige-
mediated mast cell activation

we have previously demonstrated that food-derived substances such as
curcumin can modulate mast cell responses during food allergy by
suppressing their activation and pro-allergic effects (4). the proper folding
and assembly of proteins catalyzed by pdi as well as their dimerization is a
critical component of cellular function, suggesting that the modulation of
mast cell responses during alleraic inflammation may depend on cell-
suppressing their activation and pro-allergic effects (4). the proper folding
and assembly of proteins catalyzed by pdi as well as their dimerization is a
critical component of cellular function, suggesting that the modulation of
mast cell responses during allergic inflammation may depend on cell-
specific regulation of pdi activity. furthermore, a number of recent studies
suggest novel roles for dietary pdi inhibitors in regulating cellular activation
and altering disease progression (27, 28). this includes polyphenolic
flavonoids such as the quercetin-3-glycosides, which have been shown to
inhibit pdi both in vitro and in mice (20). we therefore wondered whether
the effects of curcumin on mast cells may also be mediated via inhibition of
pdi catalytic activity. using a modified version of the insulin turbidimetric
assay that measures pdi catalytic activity (20-22), we therefore explored the
potential of curcumin to also inhibit pdi activity (figure 1). curcumin
inhibited pdi activity in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that its ability
to inhibit mast cell activation in vivo may be dependent on regulation of pdi
activity (figure 1a). pdi catalytic activity is highly induced during conditions
of er stress and upregulation of the unfolded protein response (upr). to
therefore further assess whether the inhibitory effects of curcumin on mast
cells maybe mediated via pdi inhibition, we examined its role in ige-activated
mast cells under conditions of er stress. one way of inducing er stress in
cells is to block protein transport using the chemical, brefeldin a (29)
brefeldin a inhibits transport of proteins from the er to the golgi and
induces retrograde protein transport from the golgi apparatus to the er. this
results in the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the er. examination of
tnf-a cytokine production by bmmcs after ige-induced activation using
brefeldin a inhibits transport of proteins from the er to the golgi and
induces retrograde protein transport from the golgi apparatus to the er. this
results in the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the er. examination of
tnf-a cytokine production by bmmcs after ige-induced activation using
intracellular cytokine staining revealed a significant decrease in the
generation of tnf-d-producing cells in the presence of curcumin (figure
1b). furthermore, pretreatment of bmmcs with curcumin prior to activation
with ige and antigen resulted in a significant decrease in the production of
the cytokines il-4, il-6, il-13, and tnf-a (figures 1c-f). collectively, these
data demonstrate that curcumin inhibits pdi activity and its effects on mast
cells may be mediated via pdi inhibition, warranting further assessment of
the role of pdi during mast cell-mediated responses

introduction

ige-mediated mast cell activation is a critical component in the induction of
allergic responses to food-derived antigens (1-3). the cross-linking of food-
specific antigens by ige-bearing mast cells in the intestinal tract induces a
stepwise cascade of activation-induced events, resulting first in the release
of various pre-formed mediators from mast cell granules, followed by the
synthesis of several de novo substances including various cytokines and lipid
mediators. these events are tightly orchestrated involving several
phosphorylative reactions that culminate in the activation of transcription
factors which regulate gene expression.

we have previously shown that food-derived components such as curcumin
can attenuate the development of mast cell responses during food allergy (4,
5). curcumin, a natural product found in the spice turmeric has well-known
pharmacological properties, including anti-allergic (4, 6, 7), anti-
inflammatory (8), and anti-cancer activities (9, 10). despite the interest in
curcumin and its analogues as potential therapeutics (9), there is no

5). curcumin, a natural product found in the spice turmeric has well-known
pharmacological properties, including anti-allergic (4, 6, 7), anti-
inflammatory (8), and anti-cancer activities (9, 10). despite the interest in
curcumin and its analogues as potential therapeutics (9), there is no
consensus on the molecular mechanisms by which it exerts pharmacological
action. while some studies have demonstrated curcumin acts upon various
transcription factors to regulate the expression of enzymes and cytokines (4,
11), other studies suggest that curcumin exerts these effects by modulating
the redox status of the target cell (12)

we hypothesized that dietary components such as curcumin may modulate
the mast cell response during food allergy by inhibiting the direct activation
of circulating proteins and enzymes and explored likely targets. one
common mechanism of protein activation is through an allosteric disulfide
bond, where a disulfide will rearrange to alter the intra- or intermolecular
structure of the protein to activate or inactivate it (13). the rearrangement of
these disulfide bonds is often accomplished through a thiol reductase
enzyme such as protein disulfide isomerase (pdi)

thiol isomerases such as pdi catalyze the breakage, formation and
rearrangement of disulfide bonds, regulating protein folding within the
endoplasmic reticulum (er) (14, 15). however more recent studies have
determined extracellular roles for pdi including the activation of thrombus
formation (16), entry of hiv into lymphocytes (17), and the survival and
progression of various cancers (18)

determined extracellular roles for pdi including the activation of thrombus
formation (16), entry of hiv into lymphocytes (17), and the survival and
progression of various cancers (18)

in this study, we verify the pdi inhibitory activity of curcumin and explore the
role that pdi plays in the development of mast cell-mediated responses
during food allergy using known pdi inhibitors. to date, with the exception
of a postulation that pdi catalyzes the formation of igg4 under conditions of
chronic antigen exposure (19), there has been no known role of the enzyme
in the development of mast cell-dependent allergic responses. here, we
show for the first time that mast cells express extracellular pdi on their
surface and that blockade of pdi in mast cells suppresses their function and
attenuates the development of mast cell responses during food allergy.
pretreatment of bone marrow-derived mast cells (bmmcs) with pdi
inhibitors including dietary pdi modulators suppressed their activation and
degranulation, resulting in the decreased expression and secretion of various
mast cell-derived cytokines. furthermore, treatment of wild-type mice with
pacma-31 (an orally active irreversible pdi inhibitor) in a model of ovalbumin
(ova)-induced food allergy resulted in a significant attenuation in the
development of food allergy symptoms including decreases in allergic
diarrhea, mast cell activation and allergen-specific ige. these data
demonstrate that pdi plays vital roles during mast cell-mediated responses
by regulating mast cell activation and cytokine production. furthermore,
dietary components can modulate mast cell activation during allergic
responses by regulating pdi activity, suggesting that blocking pdi function
demonstrate that pui plays vital roles during mast cell-mediated responses
by regulating mast cell activation and cytokine production. furthermore,
dietary components can modulate mast cell activation during allergic
responses by regulating pdi activity, suggesting that blocking pdi function
may prove to be of therapeutic benefit in allergic patients.
the thiol isomerase, protein disulfide isomerase (pdi), plays important
intracellular roles during protein folding, maintaining cellular function and
viability. recent studies suggest novel roles for extracellular cell surface pdi
in enhancing cellular activation and promoting their function. moreover, a

in enhancing cellular activation and promoting their function. moreover, a
number of food-derived substances have been shown to regulate cellular
pdi activity and alter disease progression. we hypothesized that pdi may
have similar roles during mast cell-mediated allergic responses and
examined its effects on ige-induced mast cell activity during cell cutture and
food allergy. mast cells were activated via ige and antigen and the effects of
pdi inhibition on mast cell activation were assessed. the effects of pdi
blockade in vivo were examined by treating mice with the irreversible pdi
inhibitor, pacma-31, in an ovalbumin-induced model of food allergy. the
role of dietary pdi modulators was investigated using various dietary
compounds including curcumin and quercetin-3-rutinoside (rutin). pdi
expression was observed on resting mast cell surfaces, intracellularly, and in
the intestines of allergic mice. furthermore, enhanced secretion of
extracellular pdi was observed on mast cell membranes during ige and
antigen activation. insulin turbidimetric assays demonstrated that curcumin
is a potent pdi inhibitor and pre-treatment of mast cells with curcumin or
established pdi inhibitors such as bacitracin, rutin or pacma-31, resulted in
the suppression of ige-mediated activation and the secretion of various
cytokines. this was accompanied by decreased mast cell proliferation, fcéri
expression, and mast cell degranulation. similarly, treatment of allergic
balb/c mice with pacma-31 attenuated the development of food allergy
resulting in decreased allergic diarrhea, mast cell activation, and fewer
intestinal mast cells. the production of tj42-specific cytokines was also

suppressed. our observations suggest that pdi catalytic activity is essential in
the regulation of mast cell activation, and that its blockade may benefit
patients with allergic inflammation.
