4. conclusion

in this study, wpi-lspc conjugate were shown to have
emulsifying properties that were better than those of wpi,
suggesting its promising utilization in food grade delivery
systems. moreover, they were shown to exhibit antioxidative
effects in flaxseed oil emulsions, which contain high levels of
polyunsaturated fats. this type of protein-polyphenol
conjugate may therefore be used as an antioxidant emulsifier
that can improve the physical and chemical stability of
functional foods containing high levels of healthy
polyunsaturated lipids. in future studies, it would be useful to
examine the bio-accessibility and bioavailability of flaxseed
oil encapsulated in this kind of delivery system.
one of the major problems associated incorporating
polyunsaturated fats into foods is their susceptibility to lipid
oxidation. for this reason, we measured the impact of
emulsifier type on the oxidative stability of the emulsions
during storage was measured. the oxidative stability was
oxidation. for this reason, we measured the impact of
emulsifier type on the oxidative stability of the emulsions
during storage was measured. the oxidative stability was
represented by the level of conjugated dienes (cd) generated
by the emulsions (fig. 6d).

there was a significant increase in cd values, from
0.490+0.013 (ue=4min) at day 0 to 0.59740.001 after 15days
for the wpi-emulsions. on the contrary, there was no
significant change in the cd values for the wpi-lspc
emulsions during storage, being 0.386+0.012 (ue=4min) and
0.412#0.015 for 0 and 15days, respectively. these results
suggest that the wpi-lspc conjugate exhibited stronger
antioxidant effects than then wpi alone.

 

mdais a typical product of oil oxidation, and its content
reflects the degree of oil oxidation, which is often used to
evaluate the quality of oil. according to fig. 6e, the mda.
amount of flaxseed oil in wpi-coated emulsions were
evidently higher than that of wpi-lspc conjugate after 14-
day storage, again suggesting a better antioxidant activity of
wpi-lspc conjugate in these systems.

finally, we examined the impact of prolonged storage under
ambient conditions on the stability of the different
emulsions. among these different groups, only the emulsions
prepared with sonication time of 4min were discussed here.

there was a large increase in the mean particle diameter
(ds) of the emulsions prepared using only wpi and a
sonication power of 40% amplitude after 1sdays storage, but
a much smaller increase in droplet size for the emulsions
prepared using wpi-lspc (fig. ga). the particle size
distribution measurements indicated that there were fewer
large particles in the wpi-lspc emulsions after storage (fig.
6c). these results suggest that the oil droplets coated by
protein-polyphenol conjugate had better stability during
long-term storage than those coated by unmodified protein.
in both systems, there was a slight decrease in the magnitude
of the negative charge on the droplets after prolonged storage
(fig. 6b), but the droplets were still strongly anionic. the
negative charge was slightly larger in the wpi-lspc samples,
which might partly account for their better storage stability.

3.3.2. influence of temperature

emulsions often undergo thermal treatments, which can alter
protein structure and interactions, thereby impacting their
stability (tcholakova et al., 2006, mcclements, 2004,
mcclements, 2007, ashokkumar et al., 2016). for this reason,
we examined the impact of thermal treatments on the
stability of the emulsions stabilized by the different
emulsifiers (ph 7). again, the emulsions were prepared using

stability of the emulsions stabilized by the different
emulsifiers (ph 7). again, the emulsions were prepared using
sonication under fixed conditions (40% amplitude, 4min).
there was little change in the mean particle diameter (d32) of
any of the emulsions as the holding temperature was
increased from ambient temperature to 90°c (fig. 5b and c).
moreover, there was a slight change in the particle size
distributions of wpi emulsions with heating, with a small
peak being observed around 50ym after heating at 50 to 90°c
for 30min, while no similar peak were observed in wpi-lspc
conjugate emulsions (fig. 5a). these results suggest that both
wpi and wpi-lspc conjugate could protect the emulsions
from heat-induced aggregation and wpi-lspc conjugate
might have a better heat resistance. this was probably
because the droplets had a relatively strong negative charge
under neutral ph conditions, which led to a strong
electrostatic repulsion between them. also, the droplets
charges of wpi-lspc conjugate emulsions remained larger
than wpi emulsions, which might support the better heat
resisitance. measurements of the impact of heating on the

surface potential of the droplets in the emulsions showed
that there was little change in their droplet charge after
holding at elevated temperatures (fig. 5c and 5d), which
suggests that there was little change in the interfacial
chemistry produced by heating.

in general, the droplets coated by wpi-lspc conjugate had a
higher negative charge than those coated by wpi alone,
which might result to a better stability during storage for
wpi-lspc conjugate coated emulsions. additionally, there
appeared to be an appreciable decrease in the negative
charge on the droplets with increasing sonication time in
both systems (fig. 3c). these results suggest that intense
sonication may lead to a change in the surface chemistry of
the droplets. except from the droplet properties
measurements, the influence of the ultrasonication time on
the flaxseed oxidation in emulsions were also determined.
according to fig. 3d, the cd value results showed that for
both wpi and wpi-lspc conjugate group, ultrasonication
time seemed to have no pro-oxidation effects on flaxseed oil
during emulsion formation process. this result was
consistent with the published article which illustrate similar
phenomena within 8 mins ultrasonication (shanmugam, &
ashokkumar, 2014).

3.3. impact of environmental conditions on
emulsion stability

3.3.1. influence of ph

food emulsions may be utilized within food matrices that
have different ph values and so the ph-tolerance to the
emulsions was determined. in these experiments, fixed
sonication conditions (40% amplitude, 4min) were used to
prepare the emulsions because these conditions gave
samples containing small oil droplet sizes for both wpi and
wpi-lspc conjugate coated emulsions without over-
processing.

the particle size and microstructure of the emulsions
stabilized by both wpi and wpi-lspc conjugate depended
strongly on ph (fig. 4a, c and d). in particular, there was a
large increase in mean particle diameter and evidence of
extensive droplet flocculation at ph values around the
isoelectric point of the whev proteins (ph 4 and 5). this
large increase in mean particle diameter and evidence of
extensive droplet flocculation at ph values around the
isoelectric point of the whey proteins (ph 4 and 5). this
aggregation was observed in both the wpi and wpi-lspc
emulsions. the origin of the droplet aggregation observed at
intermediate ph values can be attributed to the reduction in
the magnitude of the surface potential on the oil droplets in
both emulsions in this ph range (fig. 4b). the droplets in
both emulsions went from highly cationic at ph 2 to highly
anionic at ph 8, with a point of no charge around ph 4 to 5.
consequently, there was a strong electrostatic repulsion
between the droplets at low and high ph values, which
inhibited droplet aggregation, but not at intermediate ph
values (nasrabadi, golia, doostb, dewettinckc, & meeren,
2019). these results suggest that the attachment of the
polyphenols to the proteins did not cause a major change in
their charge characteristics.

3.2. antioxidant and emulsifying properties of
wpi-lspc conjugate

the dpph results showed that, at the same concentration,
wpi-lspc conjugate showed 5.44 times of scavenging rate
(90.53+1.48%) compared with wpi (17.06+3.34%). the
reducing power results showed that, at the same
concentration, wpi-lspc conjugate showed 66.34 times of
ferric reducing power (691.8524.541g/ml) compared with
wpi (10,43+0.26ug/ml). these results clearlv showed that
concentration, wpi-lspc conjugate showed 66.34 times of
ferric reducing power (691.8524.541g/ml) compared with
wpi (10.43+0.26 g/ml). these results clearly showed that
wpi-lspc conjugate possessed a higher antioxidant ability
compared with wpi in aqueous phase. fig. 1c showed the
water contact angle of two types of protein. the results
showed that wpi-lspc conjugate (74.18+ 1.27) had a bigger
water contact angle than wpi (56.90+0.25), which indicated
that after lspc grafting, the emulsifying performance of wpi
at oil/water interface could be improved. thus, a series of
emulsions using either wpi or wpi-lspc conjugate were
prepared under different sonication time and then examined
to determine their physiochemical- stability.

there was a general decrease in droplet size with sonication
time below 4min, which can be attributed to the fact that
there was more disruptive air flow available to deform and
break up the individual oil droplets. there was a significant
increase in mean particle diameter (d32) of wpi coated
emulsions after prolonged sonication, which may have been
due to excessive denaturation of the globular proteins caused
increase in mean particle diameter (d32) of wpi coated
emulsions after prolonged sonication, which may have been
due to excessive denaturation of the globular proteins caused
by the high-intensity ultrasonic waves (o'sullivan, park,
beevers, greenwood, & norton, 2017). and as a result, the
proteins lost their ability to adsorb to the oil droplet surfaces
and stabilize them against aggregation. however, the increase
of particle size of wpi-lspc conjugate coated emulsions with
prolonged sonication time was slight, suggesting a more
compact structure of wpi-lspc conjugate. the particle size
jistribution measurements also indicated that there was a
ifference in droplets formed at prolonged sonication times
between two protein coated emulsions (fig. 3a and 3b).

 

 

 

 
the changes of -sh- after conjugation with lspc was further
measured. according to our results, the free -sh- had a
slightly decrease of wpi-lspc conjugate (6.24+0.29mol/g)
after grafting with polyphenol than pure wpi
(6.97+0.56umol/g), which suggesting a slight interaction of
lspc with -sh- in protein.

the higher endothermic peak of wpi-lspc conjugate
indicated a higher thermal stability than wpi, suggesting the
thermal resistance of wp! after grafted with lspc was
enhanced. this result agreed with the results in section 3.3.2,
supporting the thermal stability of wpi-lspc conjugate
coated flaxseed oil emulsions.

3.1.4. nmr analysis of wpi-lspc conjugate

in the present work, we have adopted a simple one-step
reaction, using ascorbic acid and hydrogen peroxide redox
pair as initiators in aqueous solution to generate free radical
species at room temperature, and obtained wpi - antioxidant
molecule lspc copolymer through the simple conjugation
process (scheme 1).

the 'h nmr measurements was performed to explain the
ifferences of the molecular structures between the wpi and
wpi-lspc conjugate. the nmr spectra of the lspc-wpi
conjugate contained characteristic peaks from both the wpi
and lspc molecules (fig. 1c), revealing the fine binding of
lspc to the protein. specifically, the chemical shift (5,) values
conjugate contained characteristic peaks from both the wpi
and lspc molecules (fig. 1c), revealing the fine binding of
lspc to the protein. specifically, the chemical shift (5,) values
of wpi-lspc conjugate observed between 0.945 and
0.294ppm are consistent with whey protein, while those
observed between 7.48 and 6.71 ppm are consistent with
lspc.

 

beyond that, wpi- with single electron was formed by the
attack at the heteroatoms (such as s, n, 0) of amino acids
(met, trp, tyr, cys, and his) side-chain residues of wpi with
hydroxyl radicals, which will graft with the b ring (positions
2 and 5) and a ring (6 and 8) of lspc. so, the nmr spectrum
of the conjugate appeared a new wide peak between 7.2 and
7.48 after grafting. this is because lspc aromatic ring forms a
greatly conjugated system with heteroatoms of amino acid
side chains in wpi, which makes the chemical displacement
move to the lower field. the disappearance of the peaks
around 3.4 and 5.7ppm associated with the lspc after
conjugation suggested that several molecular groups were
lost or modified by this process.

around 3.4 and 5./ppm associated with the lspc atter
conjugation suggested that several molecular groups were

3.1.5. sds-page and sh analysis of wpi-lspc
conjugate

 

sds-page patterns of the wpi and wpi-lspc conjugate
showed that the molecular weight distribution of the
samples changed significantly after conjugation (fig. 1d). it is
known that there are three major components in whey
protein: a-lactalbumin (14.2kda), b-lactoglobulin (18.2kda),
and bovine serum albumin (66.0kda) (fan, liu, gao, zhang, &
yi, 2018). the sds-page patterns of wpi indicated there were
two major bands below the 25kda marker, which should be
cclactalbumin and b-lactoglobulin. the lowest bands in each
of the four samples were rather similar, suggesting that the
structure of the a-lactalbumin in the lspc-wpi conjugate did
not change much. the band near the 15kda marker had a
lower position in the wpi sample than in the lspc-wpi
conjugate sample, which suggests that the molecular weight
of the r-lgctaglohulin fraction increased after caniugation
lower position in the wpi sample than in the lspc-wpi
conjugate sample, which suggests that the molecular weight
of the f-lactoglobulin fraction increased after conjugation.
additionally, the band just below 70kda, which should be the
bovine serum albumin, was light in the lspc-wpi conjugate
sample. this might have been due to aggregation and
sedimentation of this higher molecular weight protein during
conjugation, thereby leading to its removal during the
filtration step (fan, liu, gao, zhang, & yi, 2018). according to
fig. 2b, the line with 2-me added showed no obvious
difference between the lines without 2-me, which suggesting
the absence of new -s—s- after conjugation. under neutral
ph, lspc can also interact with proteins through hydrophobic
or hydrophilic interactions etc, thus might lead to the
formation of soluble complex. compared with the covalent
interaction, some of the non-covalent interaction which is
not strong enough might be damaged after dialysis. the
reserved complex can also affect the antioxidant and
emulsifying properties of both the individual components

fluorescence spectroscopy analysis is often used to examine
the tertiary structure of protein due to the high se1 ity of
intrinsic fluorophore trp to the changes of
microenvironment. fig. 1b illustrated that grafting of lspc to.
wpi induced intensively quenching effect of the intrinsic
fluorescence, namely the wpi-lspc conjugate had much
lower intrinsic fluorescence emission intensities than wpi.
these results demonstrated a sharply changes of the internal
trp residues microenvironment within the macromolecular
structure of wpi-lspc conjugate, similar to other protein
complexes manufactured by crosslinking or polymerization
(tao, et al., 2018). additionally, a dramatic red-shift of the
maximum emission fluorescence was observed after
conjugation, which indicates an increase in the polarity of the
microenvironment surrounding the trp residues. above all,
lspc-grafting might lead to changes of native tertiary
structure and conformation of wp! like unfolding or
denaturation, thus could alter its interface characteristic

denaturation, thus could alter its interface characteristic
including emulsifying ability.

to fully understand the structural changes of wpi after
conjugation with lspc, the far-uv cd spectroscopy was
performed and the secondary structure changes were
analyzed. as reported, there is a typical negative band
between 210 and 220nm of cd spectra of wpi (fan, liu, gao,
zhang, & yi, 2018). compared with wpi, wpi-lspc conjugate
showed a larger negative value around 190-220nm and a
ignificant blue shift, with a 9nm shift of the wavelength of
maximum negative peak (from 215 to 206nm). compared
with wpi, the estimated secondary structure compositions of
wpi-egcg conjugate showed subtle changes (data not
shown). specifically, the composition of b-sheet was
increased from 31.3% to 36.6%, and unordered decreased from
32.8% to 28.2%. results of secondary structures changes
further confirmed the success of covalent lspc grafting and
might indicate the different physicochemical and biological
activity of the modified protein.

3.1.3. ft-ir analysis of wpi-lspc conjugate

according to fig. 1d, the ftir spectra of wpi-lspc conjugate
showed three characteristic bands of amide i (1700-
1600cm, c=o stretching mode), amide ii (1550-1500cm™!,
c—n stretching coupled with n—h bending), and amide iii
(1300-1200cm~, n—h bending and c—n stretching
vibration), respectively. the peak positions of wpi spectrum
at 1655cm™ and 1535cm™ were shifted to 1647cm™ and
1539cm in the spectra of wpi-lspc conjugate, respectively,
which indicated that the secondary structure of wpi-lspc
conjugate was changed after graft (wu et al., 2011). this
could be induced by the new interactions between wpi and
lspc since hydrogen bonds could increase the nh bending
vibration frequency and decrease the c=0 stretching
vibration frequency (barth, 2007). another possible reason
for this shift could be the covalent interaction between -nh3
in protein with phenolic ring of lspc (yang et al., 2013,
nooshkam and varidi, 2020, spizzirri et al., 2009). in

used to analyze changes in the whey proteins after

that the wpi-lspc conjugate had a higher absorption at
280nm than wpi alone (fig. 1a) at the same concentration.
the huge increasement at the typical absorption wavelength
of lspc is ascribable to the formation of the covalent bonds

astatic light scattering instrument (malvern mastersizer

the emulsions were stirred at a rate of 1250rpm in the

refractive index was set at 1.474 for flaxseed oil and 1.336 for
water (dai, et al., 2019).

coarse oil-in-water emulsions were formed by blending oil
and aqueous phases (10:90 w/w) together using a high-shear
mixer at 10,000rpm for 1 min (m133/1281~
products, inc., esgc, switzerland). fine oil-in-water
emulsions were then formed by sonication of the coarse
emulsions using a sonicator (thermo fisher scientific, catalog
number: fb505): frequency=20khz; power=500w at 40%
amplitude; sonication on/off time=02/02s. a fisherbrand™
replaceable tip probe (diameter: 13mm) was immersed into
the coarse emulsions until the distance between the tip and
the bottom of the beaker was 1cm. the impact of sonication
time (1, 2, 4,6 and 8min) on emulsion properties was
examined (lane, li, smith, & derbyshire, 2016).

1. introduction

omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 pufa) are an
important class of hydrophobic bioactive substances that
cannot be synthesized in the human body while contribute to
human health in multiple ways (schmitz, & ecker, 2008). it is
therefore essential for individuals to obtain these nutrients
through consumption of pufa-rich foods. the rise in
popularity of plant-based foods and emphasis on
environment protecting has led to an increase in consumer
demand for n-3 pufa-rich flaxseed oils instead of fish oil
(fioramonti, martinez, pilosof, rubiolo, & santiago, 2015).
flaxseed oil, however, is highly prone to lipid oxidation
during storage, resulting in the formation of a variety of
reaction products that can lead to off flavors (rancidity), as
well as potentially toxic effects (huber, rupasinghe, &
shahidi, 2009). the digestion and absorption of flaxseed oil
within the human gastrointestinal tract (git) may also be
limited, leading to a reduced bioavailability. there is
therefore a need for flaxseed oil-rich foods that are
chemically stable during storage and that haye high

limited, leading to a reduced bioavailability. there is
therefore a need for flaxseed oil-rich foods that are
chemically stable during storage and that have high
joavailability after ingestion. these aims can often be
achieved by converting flaxseed oil into an emulsified form.

 

biological macromolecules including protein and
polysaccharide play a vital role in constructing oil-in-water
emulsions, which are widely used to encapsulate and deliver
hydrophobic bioactive because of their ease of production
and versatility of application in a wide range of products, as
well as their nutritive value and natural source (mcclements,
2018). specifically, whey protein isolate (wpi) is one of the
most commonly utilized natural emulsifiers in the food
industry (kralova, & sjéblom, 2009). nevertheless, it has little
inherent antioxidant activity and restricted interfacial
stability, which limits its application in easily-oxidized n-3
pufa emulsions, as well as in varied food processing
procedure such as acidic ph and high temperature.

  

for this reason, researchers have been developing

 

procedure such as acidic ph and high temperature.
for this reason, researchers have been developing
polyphenol/polysaccharide -wpi conjugation to boost the
function of protein at the interface of the droplets in o/w
emulsions, fabricating new-type antioxidant emulsifiers by
conjugating proteins to polyphenols have been a research
hotspot (mcclements and decker, 2018, tao et al., 2018, fan et
al., 2018, fan et al., 2017, gu et al., 2017). lotus seedpod
proanthocyanidin (lspc) are a class of natural polyphenols
that possess strong antioxidant activity and various health-
maintaining functions including enhancing cognitive health,
inhibiting food borne pathogenic bacteria and advanced
glycation end products etc (huang et al., 2009, chen et al.
2020, li et al., 2019). previously, lotus seedpod
proanthocyanidin (lspc) without conjugation has been
reported to have strong antioxidant and interfacial acti
nanoemulsions (chen et al., 2020, li et al., 2019). according to
the polar paradox theory, the distribution of antioxidants
strongly affects their inhibiting effects against the oxidation
process in o/w and bulk oil systems (laguerte, et al,, 2016).
gie purar parddwa uieury, uke usu wuubh of ailuuxiuains’ *
strongly affects their inhibiting effects against the oxidation
process in o/w and bulk oil systems (laguerte, et al,, 2016).
compared with the uncombined polyphenol, the conjugated
polyphenol-protein molecules have a dense location at the
oil|water interface, which could enhance the antioxidative
efficacy as well as the physical barrier effect. hence, we
hypothesized that attaching the lspc molecules to whey
proteins would lead to the formation of a new-type
macromolecular emulsifiers that could be applied to increase
both the physical and chemical stability of flaxseed oil
emulsions.

 

 

sonication has been reported to be an efficient and energy-
saving method to create oil-in-water emulsions through
acoustic cavitation effects (walia, dasgupta, ranjan, chen, &
ramalingam, 2017). additionally, sonication may also
improve emulsion formation and stability by altering the
tertiary structure of protein-based emulsifiers, thereby
enhancing their absorption to the oil-water interface
(o'sullivan, murray, flynn, & norton, 2016). nevertheless, the
homogenization conditions and emulsifier formulation must
enhancing their absorption to the oil-water interface
(o'sullivan, murray, flynn, & norton, 2016). nevertheless, the
homogenization conditions and emulsifier formulation must
be optimized to produce high-quality emulsions with the
desired functional attributes (shen et al., 2017, gao et al.,
2019). under-processing will lead to the formation of
emulsions containing large oil droplets that will cream
rapidly during storage. conversely, over-processing might
induce oxidation of pufas and promote denaturation of
protein-based emulsifiers, thereby decreasing the chemical
and physical stability of the system (o'sullivan, & norton,
2016). thus, it is crucial to select the most suitable emulsifier
and ultrasonic emulsification (ue) parameters to obtain a
preferable emulsion (o'sullivan et al., 2016, jiang et al., 2017).

thus, in this study, after synthesis and characterization of
wpi-lspc conjugate, tailored sonication procedure was
applied to prepare wpi-lspc conjugate/wpi encapsulated
flaxseed oil emulsions. emulsions fabricated using only whey
protein as an emulsifier were used as a control group. we
believe that this study should contribute to the development
flaxseed oil emulsions. emulsions fabricated using only whey
protein as an emulsifier were used as a control group. we
believe that this study should contribute to the development
of more environmentally friendly and effective encapsulation
systems for oxidizable hydrophobic bioactive, like omega-3
fatty acids.

emulsified -3 polyunsaturated fatty acid have expanding
application in different food matrix with improved water
solubility while still prone to oxidation. lotus seedpod
proanthocyanidin (lspc) was grafted to whey protein isolate
(wpi) to create nature-derived antioxidant emulsifiers.
‘hnmr, sds-page and multiple spectrometry showed that
the structure of protein was changed after grafting. dpph and
frap measurements showed that wpi-lspc conjugate
(90.53+1.48% of dpph scavenging, 691.8524.54yg/ml for
frap assay) possessed a much better antioxidant ability than
wpi (17.06£3.34% of dpph scavenging, 10.43+0.26yg/ml for
frap assay). ultrasonic emulsification and dsc experiments
showed that wpi-lspc conjugate were more effective at
wpi (17.06£3.34% of dpph scavenging, 10.43+0.26yg/ml for
frap assay). ultrasonic emulsification and dsc experiments
showed that wpi-lspc conjugate were more effective at
forming and stabilizing the flaxseed oil emulsions than pure
wpi, with higher thermostability. likewise, low levels of
primary and secondary oxidation products were formed for
the conjugate than the pure protein in 0/w systems after
storage, again suggesting wpi-lspc could be used as fine
antioxidant emulsifiers in oxidizing delivery systems.
