discussion

the tackling aki study demonstrated that an organizational
level intervention aimed at improving consistency of
delivered aki care resulted in reduced hospital los. in this
study, we show that this leads to an incremental cost saving
and that the intervention, consisting of aki e-alerts, an aki
care bundle, and an education program, is cost effective in
the setting of the nhs in england.

health care costs associated with aki are substantial. in the
uk, these have been estimated at £1.02 billion per year,> with
corresponding figures in the united states of $5 billion to $24
ion.78 increased resource utilization arises from longer
hospital stays, the requirement for icu care and rrt, as well
cenespultaihy taletoilean tonmarauabeur uh andre ses
illion.”* increased resource utilization arises from longer
hospital stays, the requirement for icu care and rrt, as well
as costs attributable to long-term sequelae, such as chronic
kidney disease, end-stage kidney disease, and cardiovascular
isease. of these, rrt is particularly expensive on an
individual patient basis but is required in only a small
percentage of patients. at a population level, excess bed days
are a major driver of additional costs. in the study by kerr
etal,,° 81% (£825 million) of the annual £1.02 billion cost of
inpatient aki care in england was incurred by excess bed
days. similarly, a us study found the incremental cost of an
episode of aki after coronary intervention to be $9448, of
which half was due to increased length of hospital stay.2°
while the economic impact of aki has been well described,>
there are few examples of studies that have reported cost-
effectiveness analyses, making it challenging to determine
whether cost savings can be realized through improved
management of aki. mistry etal.4 performed a micro-costings

shorter los and costs were suggested.’ in a study that tested
an aki alerting and decision-making application, connell
etal.'° reported a reduction in inpatient costs of £2123
(possibly due to shorter los) but did not consider the costs of
providing the intervention, so cost-effectiveness analyses
were precluded. in a randomized trial, a biomarker-guided
care bundle after major abdominal surgery led to a lower
incidence of severe aki (stages 2-3), shorter duration of icu
stay, and reduced hospital los, which was estimated to result
in a cost savings of €2301 per admission.*° other than this,
studies have either focused on critical care, choice of rrt
modality, or theoretical models.??!

 

 

 

 

our study is consistent with these results and adds to
observations that costs of aki admissions can be reduced by
organization-wide interventions that reduce hospital los.

our study has been performed using data from a rigorously
performed randomized trial and shows that an approach
focused on improving delivered aki care is cost effective,
with a high probability of cost effectiveness across the range
of wtp thresholds. these findings were robust in psa
analyses with 5000 model iterations and across different
clinical scenarios. the dominant effect is facilitated by the
low cost of the intervention. in our assumptions, we were
deliberately conservative by including additional senior

cli in time for delivery of care and for the educational
activities. in practice, it is likely that some of these actions
can be carried out by existing staff, which would incur lower
expenditure for implementation. conversely, we did not
include initial expenditure for installation of the aki alerts as
this has been mandated in england since 2014 and was in
place at participating centers in the tackling aki study.
however, a one-off cost for software purchase is unlikely to
change the cost per aki episode of the intervention
significantly due to the high incidence of aki. this is shown

possible that additional unmeasured expense could have
resulted if there were changes in practice with the
intervention that were not included in the modelling (e.g.,
additional laboratory testing), although it should be noted
that there were no differences observed in rates of specialist
referral, renal imaging, and urinary catheterization between
the 2 arms.

 

the relevance of these results to organizations,
commissioners, and for those involved in health care
reimbursement is that wider adoption of similar strategies
could result in significant systemwide cost savings.
extrapolating results beyond the scope of the tacking aki

is unlikely that costs and clinical effects of the tackling aki
intervention would be identical across different hospitals, it
is possible that the intervention may require tailoring for
local context to maintain effectiveness, and some hospitals
may now have aki initiatives in place that were not in place
when the tackling aki study was conceived, including
responses to the think kidneys programme.*? however,
comparison with the ukrr datasetallows a nationwide view
on the potential health care savings to the nhs in england,
which could amount to >£100 milli
focus of systemwide improvement. while crude, these
extrapolations are premised on identical detection of aki
episodes using the same creatinine-based algorithm in both
the ukrr dataset and the tackling aki study, and that the
sociodemographic details of the patient cohorts are
comparable. although reductions in hospital los are one of
the most consistently reported effects of aki quality
improvement initiatives, these estimations should be
tempered by the range of effect sizes reported in the
published literature (with some studies reporting zero
effect).!?!3.334 it should also be noted that our findings may
tempered by the range of effect sizes reported in the
published literature (with some studies reporting zero
effect).!?!3.334 it should also be noted that our findings may
not be generalizable outside of the nhs, although there are
reports from outside of the uk that suggest similar effects, for
example a us study that reported a similar magnitude of
reduced hospital los after introduction of a clinical decision
support system for aki.!>

 

 

if aki care was the

there are several limitations of this study. because of the
pragmatic design of the tackling aki study, there was no
available information on quality of life (utility data), nor
detailed costings for an aki admission during the control
period, so values were taken from the published literature.
however, we aimed to make conservative assumptions so
assigned the same utility data values (qalys) to control and
intervention arms and to different stages of aki. we also used
uk data sources. icu admissions were not accurately coded in
the tackling aki dataset, so although the effect of icu
admission was included in a sensitivity analysis, results of
models containing icu admission should be regarded with

admission was included in a sensitivity analysis, results of
models containing icu admission should be regarded with
caution. inclusion of icu admission did however confirm that
the main findings of the cost-effectiveness analysis were not
significantly altered. we considered only direct health care
costs and did not have access to long-term clinical or health

ig costs associated with hospital
readmission. we did not include the cost of implementing e-
alerts, and although this may have altered the cost per aki
episode in the intervention arm, a “one-off” cost is unlikely to
have changed the results significantly. however, this should
be considered if implementation in a different organization
id incur such a cost. a further limitation is that while
clinician time was included as part of the cost of the

 

 

 

 

  

intervention, it was not possible to estimate whether this led
to effects elsewhere in the system due to redistribution of
clinician time. finally, extrapolations of potential cost savings
beyond the tackling aki dataset are hypothesis-generating
only.

since 2014, the uk renal registry has collected nationwide
data on aki in england, using the same approach as the
tackling aki study to define aki episodes. the recently
published report from the ukrr (using 2018 data) described
313,932 hospital admissions with an aki episode, who had
similar patient demographics and aki characteristics as those
in the tackling aki study, and a median hospital los of 12
days (iqr 6-24 days). of these, 221,894 admissions met
standards for data reliability and survived to hospital
discharge. a crude extrapolation of the £732 incremental cost
saving from our model across these admissions would
suggest a cost-saving in the range of £162.4 to £229.8
per annum to nhs england, assuming that the tackling aki
intervention was rolled out to all hospitals and had the same
costs and effect in all. asa reference, total nhs england
spending (department of health and social care) in 2018 and
2019 was £130 billion,7* so £162.4 million represents 0.12% of
this amount. alternatively, this would represent a 16% cost
spending (department of health and social care) in 2018 and
2019 was £130 billion,7* so £162.4 million represents 0.12% of
this amount. alternatively, this would represent a 16% cost
savings against the estimated annual costs of £1.02 billion for
aki-related inpatient care in england.>

overall 30-day mortality was 24.5%, with no difference
between control and intervention periods (or 1.04 [95% ci

intervention was observed in the 18,887 admissions in which
the patient was discharged alive. at the 0.5 quantile, the
effect size was a reduced los of-0.7days, extending to-1.3
days at the 0.7 quantile. overall, this represented a 6.6% (95%
cl 1.3-11.6%) reduction in los (negative binomial regression).
ilar results were seen in a sensitivity analysis that
included all admissions, regardless of whether the patient
was alive at discharge (reduced los of-0.8 days at the 0.5
quantile and-1.1 days at the 0.7 quantile). a reduction in aki
duration (defined as number of days between first and last

received acute rrt and this was no different between study
arms (odds ratio 1.1 [95% ci 0.8-1.6]).

 

cost effectiveness model

ina scenario that considered all aki stages together and did
not include icu admission data, the cost per aki admission
was calculated to be £5065 in the control arm and £4333 in
the intervention arm, representing an incremental cost
saving of £732 per admission with the intervention. when
aki was separated into 3 stages of severity, the results were
similar: cost per admission of £5016 in control group; £4287
in intervention group; and incremental cost saving with the
intervention was £729. a scenario that considered icu
admission also showed a cost saving with the intervention,
although this was reduced when aki stages were considered
separately (supplementary material).

 

 

 

although this was reduced when aki stages were considered
separately (supplementary material).

in the first scenario (aki stage not included in model), qalys
were estimated at 0.08 in control and intervention arms,
which resulted in costs per qaly of £61,194 and £52,161,
respectively. the cost-effectiveness scatterplot generated
from the psa is shown in figure2. of the 5000 iterations,
44.7% suggested the intervention was more effective and less
expensive, 13.3% more effective but more expensive, 40.8%
that the intervention was both less effective and less
expensive, and only 1.2% that the intervention was less
effective but more expensive. at the wtp threshold of
£20,000 per qaly, the probability of the intervention being
cost-effective as compared with standard care was 90.1%.
even at a wtp threshold of £0 per qaly, the probability of
cost-effectiveness was 85.5%. figure3 shows these results as a
cost-effectiveness acceptability curve.

summary of main findings of the clinical study

during the study period, there were a total of 24,059 aki
episodes that occurred in 20,179 patients, giving a crude
incidence of 7.6 aki episodes per 100 admissions. there were
14,042 episodes of aki (58.4%) in the control period and
10,017 (41.6%) in the intervention period. the characteristics
of the study population were typical of a general hospitalized
aki cohort as summarized in table2.

cost-effectiveness analysis

as tackling aki was a pragmatic study, questionnaires to
collect individual quality of life data were not possible. utility
data (quality-adjusted life years [qalys]) were estimated
using eq-sd scores derived from a meta-analysis and
transformed into utility per day,“ as described previously.>
we assumed that there was no difference in health utility
between control and intervention arms, nor any differences
between different aki stages (i.e., qalys were the same
across these comparator groups), but total utility accrued

between different aki stages (i.e., qalys were the same
across these comparator groups), but total uti
could be influenced by number of days in hospital.2> for each
quantile of hospital los, the qaly per quantile during a
predefined and constant period of 36 cycles (days) were
calculated taking into consideration the probability of being
in that quantile. qalys per arm (intervention vs. control)
were then calculated using the sum of all qalys per quantile.
the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was then calculated

as follows:

cost of intervention- cost of control

utility of intervention- utility of control

a decision-analytic tree model was constructed that included
the intervention groups (standard of care intervention
defined hereafter as control and organization-level
intervention defined hereafter as the intervention), aki stage
and quantiles (1-10) for hospital los, although quantile 10
defined hereafter as control and organization-level
intervention defined hereafter as the intervention), aki stage
and quantiles (1-10) for hospital los, although quantile 10
was excluded due to high variability. this is summarized in
figure 1. cost-effectiveness was assessed using a probabilistic
sensitivity analysis (psa), which is typically conducted using
a simulation approach as follows: for each of a sequence of
iterations (s= 1,..., $), a value h(s) (eg., length of duration) is
simulated from the probability distribution. the decision
analysis was then conducted using that specific value as if
this were the value realised. the lognormal distribution was
used for los data (parameters: mu/mean and sigma/standard
deviation); a beta distribution for probabilities and a gamma
istribution for the costs and utilities were used to propagate
uncertainty (parameters: alpha and beta). the gamma
ribution was used for variables that were continuous,
always positive, and that had skewed data. by means of this
procedure, it is possible to produce a sample from the
distribution of utility, incremental cost, or any other related
random quantity.2° we used this approach to generate
probability, utility, and cost trees per study arm and quantile
istribution of utility, incremental cost, or any other related
random quantity.2° we used this approach to generate
probability, utility, and cost trees per study arm and quantile
following the model tree structure using the clinical data
from the tackling aki study database (duration from
summary statistics on the los). using the calculated cis for
the probability, duration, utility, and cost values, we
generated 5000 iterations from these distributions. models
were also constructed with aki separated into stages of
severity (1-3) and with and without icu admission. models
that did not include icu admission were used as primary
analysis, as icu admission data from 2 hospitals in the study
were not considered accurate (but considering the costs

iated with icu admission, icu analyses are included as.
sensitivity analyses). a cost-effectiveness scatterplot was
generated from the iterations from the psa by plotting
incremental costs (£) per incremental qaly. a cost-
effectiveness acceptability curve for each model was
generated by representing the probability of the intervention
of being cost-effective for every willingness to pay (wtp).
the wtp threshold for cost-effectiveness was taken as
generated by representing the probability of the intervention
of being cost-effective for every willingness to pay (wtp).
the wtp threshold for cost-effectiveness was taken as
£20,000 per qaly, which is the lower end of the range used
by the national institute for health and care excellence.””

patient costs of providing the education program and

costs calculated using delivered activity in control and
intervention arms of the study. as such, the incremental cost
of the intervention was £11.04 per aki admission; a
breakdown of this calculation is shown in table 1. most of the
cost of the intervention arose from additional activi of

in the primary analysis of the tackling aki study, 30-day
mortality was analyzed using multilevel logistic regression at
the individual patient level with hospital modelled as a
random effect, and adjusting for time, patients’ covariables
(age, gender, and comorbid conditions), and the effect of
seasonality. time was pooled into quarterly intervals and
treated as equally spaced in analytic models. the hospital
length of stay (los) and aki duration data were highly
skewed, so quantile regression models were fitted to allow

we aimed to determine the cost-effectiveness of an
intervention designed to improve the systematic delivery of
supportive aki care. to do so, we developed a decision-
analytic tree model from the payer (uk nhs) perspective on
which cost-effectiveness analyses were performed,

study cohort and clinical outcomes

the tackling aki study was a multicenter, pragmatic, stepped

intervention for aki comprised of aki e-alerts, an aki care
bundle, and an education program. between december 2014
and february 2017, the intervention was introduced across 5
nhs hospital sites in the uk. detailed methods, description of
the intervention, and results have been published in full
elsewhere." inclusion criteria were broad, with all patients
who were>18 years of age, had been hospitalized for1 night
during the study period, and who sustained aki during that
admission included in the study. aki was defined according

increased risks of mortality and longer, more complicated
hospital admissions, with a number of studies reporting the
ensuing economic burden. uk studies include a patient-level
costing approach that reported costs of a hospital admission

despite this enormous economic impact, a lack of proven
therapies for aki has limited opportunities for cost-
effectiveness studies, so at present it is uncertain whether
costs associated with aki are modifiable.“9, 10, 11 the
absence of therapies has also driven interest in strategies to
improve the delivery of basic elements of aki care. while
some previous studies have reported improved patient
outcomes with interventions designed to improve standards
of clinical care, methodologic concerns, such as a lack of
randomization, before and after design, and largely single-
center approaches have prevented firm conclusions from
being made.12, 13, 14, 15 to address this, the tackling aki
study was the first multicenter randomized trial that tested
the effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention (aki e-alerts,
an aki care bundle, and an education program) on delivery of
aki care and patient outcomes. although the intervention did
not alter 30-day mortality, significant reductions in hospital

not alter 30-day mortality, significant reductions in hospital
length of stay (los) and aki duration were observed in
conjunction with improved rates of aki recognition,
medication review, fluid assessment, and urinalysis.'° these
results led us to hypothesise that cost savings would be
realized from shortened hospital los that would be greater
than the costs required to deliver the intervention. we sought
to test this in a cost-effectiveness analysis.

results

a total of 24,059 aki episodes occurred during the study
period, and in 18,887 admissions the patient was discharged
alive. when all aki stages were considered together, the cost
per aki admission was £5065 in the control arm and £4333 in
the intervention arm, representing an incremental cost
saving of £732 per admission with the intervention. similar
results were obtained when aki stages were included as
separate variables. costs per quality-adjusted life year were
£61,194 in the control group and £51,161 in the intervention
group. at a willingness to pay threshold of £20,000 per
quality-adjusted life year, the probability of the intervention
£61,194 in thé control group and £51,161 in the intervention
group. at a willingness to pay threshold of £20,000 per

being cost-effective compared with standard care was 90%.

conclusion

an organizational level approach to improve standards of aki
care reduces the cost of hospital admissions and is cost
effective within the national health service in the united
kingdom.
introduction

acute kidney injury (aki) is associated with increased health
care utilization and higher costs. the tackling aki study was
a multicenter, pragmatic, stepped-wedge cluster randomized
trial that demonstrated a reduced hospital length of stay after
implementation of a multifaceted aki intervention (e-alerts,
care bundle, and an education program). we tested whether
this would result in cost savings.
