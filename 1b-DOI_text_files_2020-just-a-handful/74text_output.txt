abstract

curriculum learning methods typically rely on heuristics to estimate the difficulty of training examples
or the ability of the model. in this work, we propose replacing difficulty heuristics with learned difficulty
parameters. we also propose dynamic data selection for curriculum learning via ability estimation
(ddaclae), a strategy that probes model ability at each training epoch to select the best training
examples at that point. we show that models using learned difficulty and/or ability outperform heuristic-
based curriculum learning models on the glue classification tasks.
