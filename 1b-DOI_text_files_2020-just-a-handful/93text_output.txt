administration of wpc-based emulsions or emulgels, a higher concentration of
tangeretin was found in the liver and kidney after 4 h. the presence of hpmc led to
less accumulation of tangeretin in the heart and lung. this effect might be the result

of the higher levels of tangeretin in the blood, which needed to be metabolized and

in summary, we systematically investigated the bioavailability of tangeretin in

pharmacokinetic data collected from wpc/hpmc-e, wpc/hpmc-eg(ph4.5), and
wpc/hpmc-eg(ca*) were higher than other reports. manthey et al. previously
reported that the cmax value for tangeretin at a level of 50 mg/kg was about 0.49
uig/ml. (19) hung et al. fed tangeretin at a level of 50 mg/kg using saline water
containing 10% tween 80 and 20% dimethyl sulfoxide, which led to @ cmax value for
tangeretin of 870 ng/ml. (55) zhang et al. demonstrated that the lecithin-stabilized
emulsion significantly improved the bioavailability of nobiletin by 2.32-fold. the cmax
value of nobiletin in the plasma was 1.45 g/ml for emulsion when fed nobiletin at
the dosage of 100 mg/kg. (59)

all of these results illustrated that wpc-based systems could modulate the plasma
concentration of tangeretin through incorporation of additives (ca, ga, or hpmc) or
modification of emulsion structure (ph- or ca2*-cross-linking). ca addition slightly

based on the above results, we found a positive correlation between in vitro
bioaccessibility and jn vivo results of auc (which could predict the bioavailability)
(figure 5). the droplet interfaces play a key role in determining the digestion behavior
of emulsions (images in figure 5). our in vitro digestion results indicated that the
lipolysis rate was slower after the addition of ga and hpmc, which could be due to
their ability to alter the interfacial properties or interact with gastrointestinal
constituents. for instance, they may have adsorbed on the droplet surfaces and
formed a coating that partially inhibited the adsorption of lipase. alternatively, they
may have bound to bile salts, calcium ions, or digestive enzymes in the small
intestine, which slowed down digestion. the bioaccessibility of the tangeretin may
have then been improved because there was more time for it to be incorporated into
the mixed micelles or because the ga and hpmc inhibited its precipitation in the
intestinal fluids. as a result, there was more solubilized tangeretin available for

gastrointestinal fluids, thereby inhibiting crystal formation. ther

mainly located in the liver and spleen 4 h after administration, then in tne liver ana
kidney 8 h after administration. when delivered by wpc-based delivery systems, the
maximum tangeretin concentrations in most tissues were higher than those in the

the wpc/hpmc-eg(ca**) group were 2.62-fold (heart), 2.11-fold (liver), 2.34-fold
(spleen), 1.10-fold (lung), and 3.43-fold (kidney) of those in the ms group. besides,
the accumulation time of tangeretin in the kidney was prolonged to 12 h when
delivered by wpc-e, wpc/ga-e, wpc/hpmc-e, and wpc/hpmc-eg (ca”*). hence,
we further confirmed that wpc-based emulsion systems, especially the ones
containing ga and hpmc, greatly improved the tissue concentration of tangeretin,
thus enhancing its oral bioavailability. it has been reported that hpmc can affect the
bioavailability of encapsulated compounds by modulating the fat digestion process

enhance the adsorption of protein to the oil-water interface, reduce the interfacial

ca?*-cross-linking (wpc/hpmc-eg(ca"")). the scale bar represents 10 um.

to form emulgels, we selected the ph- and ca*-cross-linking methods because of
their ability to promote flocculation of whey protein-coated oil droplets using simple
processing operations (acid or mineral addition). after formation, the particle size
changed from the nano- to the microscale, with mean particle diameters of around
5.3 and 7.4 um being measured for wpc/hpmc-eg (ph 4.5) and wpc/hpmc-eg
(ca**), respectively (figure 1a). the dominant peak moved to around 10 um after
cross-linking, indicating that extensive droplet aggregation had occurred (figure 1b).
as the isoelectric point of whey protein is about ph 5.0, the surface charge of the
wpc-coated oil droplets is close to zero at ph 4.5, (34) which promotes droplet
aggregation (figure 2). the wpc-coated oil droplets flocculate in the presence of
ca?* ions under neutral ph conditions because two or more anionic droplets are held

due to the high melting point and low water solubility of tanger

crystals and separate from emulsions, which adversely affects c]=
efficiency (ee). (21) hence, we determined the ee of tangeretin

formulations. overall, the ee of tangeretin in the emulsions was _() tum off this notification
ranging from around 91 to 98% (figure s1), which was significantly higher than those
of emulsion systems stabilized by single whey protein owing to their higher oil phase.
(22) compared to wpc-e, the addition of ca, ga, or hpmc significantly (p < 0.05)
increased the ee of tangeretin. the physicochemical origin of this effect is likely to
depend on the nature of the additives. (35-38) the additives may have decreased the
permeability of the oil-water interface for tangeretin, thereby inhibiting its movement
into the aqueous phase where it can form crystals. alternatively, the additives may
have increased the viscosity of the emulsions, thereby inhibiting the sedimentation of
any tangeretin crystals formed. finally, the additives may have inhibited the
crystallization of the tangeretin within the aqueous phase by promoting
supersaturation. each of the additives may have had a different effect on these
mechanisms. ca can cross-link proteins adsorbed to oil-water interfaces, thereby
changing their permeability, whereas hpmc and ga can adsorb to droplet surfaces

or increase the viscositv of the aaueous phase. interestinaly. the ee of tanaeretin in

nutraceuticals. (40-42) during digestion, tangeretin will be released from the food
matrix, solubilized within the mixed micelles in the small intestine, and then absorbed
by the intestinal epithelial cells. the rate of lipid digestion in an emulsion depends on
its composition and structural organization. for this reason, the effects of the
different emulsion formulations on free fatty acid (ffa) release and tangeretin
bioaccessibility were measured using an in vitro method (figure 3)

the initial lipolysis process was relatively fast and similar for all emulsions, with the
exception of the wpc/hpmc-eg (ca*) one, which had an appreciably slower
lipolysis rate (figure 3a). at the end of digestion, the extent of lipolysis was the
highest and lowest for wpc-e and wpc/hpmc-eg (ca), respectively. all other
emulsions had fairly similar digestion rates. the addition of ca, ga, and hpmc to
wpc-e slightly slowed the rate of lipid digestion. this effect may have a number of

the microstructures of samples collected from different digest tu off this notification
characterized (figure 2). the oil droplets in the mouth phase were fairly similar to
those in the original samples, but a few more large aggregates were observed in the
emulgel samples. the aggregation of oil droplets was clearly observed in the
stomach, with large oil-rich clusters being observed, which is consistent with
previous studies on protein-coated oil droplets. (43,44) gastric aggregation can be
attributed to the change in ph and ionic strength that delivery systems experience
when they go from the mouth to the stomach. also, the whey protein will be partially
hydrolyzed by gastric proteases, which could also cause droplet aggregation. in the
small intestine, far fewer oil droplets were observed, indicating that the structure of
the emulsions was broken down and most of the oil droplets had been hydrolyzed.
(45) nevertheless, a few red-stained regions were observed after digestion was
completed, which can be ascribed to the presence of various types of colloidal
particles, like vesicles, micelles, and other particulates. (46,47)

tangeretin, ie, all tangeretin-loaded emulsions had a significantly higher
bioaccessibility than tangeretin in the mct phase (p< 0.05). lu et al. (48) tested the
effect of different lipid-based systems on the oral bioaccessibility of flavonoids.
results showed that emulsion systems could significantly improve the
bioaccessibility of flavonoids (33.5% for tangeretin) compared to mct suspension
(8.0% for tangeretin). addition of ca and ga to the wpc-e emulsions further
enhanced the bioaccessibility of tangeretin, which may have been due to their ability
to inhibit precipitation of the tangeretin in the aqueous phase. (30,49) the addition of
hpmc was even more effective at enhancing the bioaccessibility of tangeretin, with
an almost 2-fold increase. our previous work also found that hpmc could enhance
the bioaccessibility of nobiletin. (26) hpmc might prevent the crystallization of
tangeretin by forming a kinetic barrier to nucleation, thus reducing the nucleation
kinetics. (50) interestingly, encapsulation within the emulgels led to the highest

oral bioavailability by in vivo study —

 

in vitro digestion models are able to quickly evaluate the impact of food formulations
on the bioaccessibility of nutraceuticals, but they do not accurately reflect the
bioavailability under actual physiological conditions. hence, we used an in vivo study
to investigate the influence of the different emulsion formulations with different
interfacial compositions and structures on the oral bioavailability of the tangeretin

pharmacokinetic study

tangeretin concentrations in the samples were determined by liquid
chromatography. the uplc chromatogram profiles exhibited peaks at 6.26 and 7.18
min (figure s2), which correspond to the presence of nobiletin (is) and tangeretin

(aglycone). the dose of tangeretin used for oral administration was 100 mg/kg body

could delay the circulation time of tangeretin to 22 h and greatly increase the crnax

precipitation of the tangeretin in the gastrointestinal tract, thereby increasing the
amount available for absorption. a recent study showed that hpmc addition could

many people in modern society are actively selecting diets that may promote a long
and healthy life. hence, researchers in the food, nutrition, and medical fields are
developing functional foods and beverages that are fortified with nonessential food
components that may have health benefits, ie, nutraceuticals. in particular, there has
been a growing emphasis on designing food matrices that enhance the bioavailability
of nutraceuticals so as to ensure they actually exhibit their beneficial effects after
ingestion. (1) in particular, hydrophobic nutraceuticals are reported to be better
absorbed when they are ingested with digestible lipids. (2-4) lipid-based

tangeretin is a highly hydrophobic crystalline nutraceutical that has a low water
solubility and poor oral bioavailability. the rat plasma concentration of tangeretin was
less than 0.49 g/ml when tangeretin was fed at a dose level of 50 mg/kg. (19) for

this reason, the oral administration of tangeretin is still limited by its low
bioavailability and the difficulty in incorporating it into foods.

researchers have attempted to overcome many of these challenges by
encapsulating flavonoids into various kinds of lipid-based formulations. for instance,
nobiletin has been encapsulated within oil-in-water emulsions to enhance its
bioaccessibility, but nobiletin crystals were observed in the samples after long-term
storage. (20) tangeretin has also been encapsulated in highly viscoelastic emulsions
to achieve high-loading and inhibit crystal sedimentation. (21) these emulsions were
then shown to improve the oral bioavailability of tangeretin (2.3-fold) (5) and enhance

its anticancer efficacy. (6) emulsion delivery systems have also been shown to._

attributed to the ability of the biopolymers to inhibit the precipitation of flavonoid
crystals. the performance of emulsion delivery systems can also be enhanced by
altering their interfacial and textural properties. for example, controlling the
interfacial composition and rheology of emulsions has been shown to improve the
encapsulation efficiency (ee) and bioaccessibility of nobiletin. (28,29),

research, tangeretin was encapsulated within whey protein-stabilized emulsions

containing ingredients that may alter their behavior under gastrointestinal
conditions and enhance the bioavailability of tangeretin after oral administration:
cinnamaldehyde (ca), gum arabic (ga), or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose
(hpmc). the presence of these ingredients altered the size, aggregation state, and
encapsulation efficiency of tangeretin in the emulsions. in vitro studies

 

demonstrated that the bioaccessibility of the encapsulated tangeretin was much

higher than that of a crude tangeretin oil suspension. particularly, the addition of

hpmc increased the bioaccessibility of tangeretin from around 36 to 90%. in vivo
pharmacokinetics results using rats indicated that tangeretin concentration in the

plasma increased from 4- to 20-fold after encapsulation, especially in the presence

of hpmc. hpmc also prolonged the release of tangeretin to 22 h. tangeretin preferentially
