the current study adds to extant findings and theory regarding the development
of er in childhood by testing hypotheses about the interplay of parental
perceptions of their own responses to emotions and household chaos, in the
prediction of individual differences in children's er. the current study addresses
two major gaps in the literature. firstly, much of the relevant prior research on
child er has focused on early development, with comparatively little research
examining individual differences across middle childhood, especially while also
examining the parenting and broader household context. secondly, nearly all the
related prior studies have used cross-sectional designs, which do not permit
estimation of temporal patterns in the covariation between constructs across
multiple time points. the current study addresses both gaps by using a
longitudinal design to examine individual differences at two times points in
middle childhood (6 and 9 years of age). study hypotheses investigating variation
in children's er were tested at each time point separately and longitudinally. to
our knowledge, no prior studies have examined associations between parent
responses and child er across middle childhood in the context of a wide range of
levels of household chaos.

 

consistent with the first hypothesis regarding direct associations between parent
responses, chaos, and child er (h1), we found that mothers’ reports of children's
better er were statistically predicted at 6 years, and also at 9 years (regardless of
whether the 6-year variables were included in the equation), by mothers’ more

supportive responses, less non-supportive responses, and less household chaos.

better er were statistically predicted at 6 years, and also at 9 years (regardless of
whether the 6-year variables were included in the equation), by mothers’ more
supportive responses, less non-supportive responses, and less household chaos.
however, all significant effects were only observed within each time point; there
were no significant longitudinal associations between parenting responses (at the
age of six) and er (at age 9). it also is noteworthy that the overall pattern of
results was consistent across the individual subscales within the non-supportive
and supportive parent response composites, with regard to statistical prediction
of child er (see supplementary results).

overall, the findings for h1 with regard to ‘main effects’ align with previous
studies, suggesting that chaos and non-supportive parental responses to
emotions are associated with poorer er, but parents’ supportive responses serve
a beneficial role in er development, at two points in middle childhood (dumas

et al,, 2005; evan et al., 2005; vernon-feagans, 2016). parent-child interactions
regarding children's negative emotions are an important aspect of emotion
socialization, and they provide a key context for children to acquire emotion
knowledge and regulation skills (eisenberg et al., 1996; mcelwain et al., 2007;
pintar breen et al., 2018). parents indirectly and directly teach their children about
the meaning of emotions and how to respond to their own and other's emi
and these are critical experiences for healthy emotion socialization in fami
(eisenberg et al., 1996; pintar breen et al., 2018).

supportive responses include striving to understand the child's negative
emotions, helping the child solve the problem, and validating the child's feelings.
our interpretation of the current study's findings is that supportive responses can
promote children's developing er by helping children feel emotionally safe, better
enabling the regulation of emotions, and ensuring socially acceptable expression
of emotions (houltberg et al., 2016; morris et al., 2017). in contrast, when parents
are harsh and controlling, children have more difficulty regulating their emotions
because parental responses to children's emotions can increase distress (morris
et al,, 2017). non-supportive emotion parenting behaviors can create an
environment where emotions are not discussed, are regarded as insignificant, are
discouraged, or are overtly judged in a negative way (denham et al., 1994;
morelen et al., 2016). however, the current study cannot address one major gap
in the literature: whether these interpretations of emotion socialization processes
generalize broadly across cultural contexts. there may be cultural differences in
how these processes operate—for example, the ways in which parents and
children interact, how children express their emotions, and how parents and
children alike interpret and react to each other's emotions (emde et al., 1991;
morris et al., 2007; saarni, 1990). in particular, studies that focus on african
american (nelson et al., 2013; smith & walden, 2001), latinx (pintar breen et al.,

2018). and korean (song & trommsdorff. 2016) families have observed different
children alike interpret and react to each other's emotions (emde et al., 1991;

morris et al., 2007; saarni, 1990). in particular, studies that focus on african
american (nelson et al., 2013; smith & walden, 2001), latinx (pintar breen et al.,
2018), and korean (song & trommsdorff, 2016) families have observed different
distinct patterns of supportive and non-supportive emotion socialization
behaviors and associations with children's er development.

turning to the proposed interaction effects involving household chaos and non-
supportive parent responses (h2), results showed that mothers’ reports of
household chaos moderated the link between non-supportive responses and
children’s er (h2), but only at 6 years of age and the effect size was smalll. post
hoc probing showed that the pattern was the opposite of what we had expected
for h2. rather than the link between non-supportive responses and poorer child
er being stronger at higher levels of chaos, this link was stronger at lower levels of
chaos. this pattern was unexpected. we return later to this finding to offer an
itial speculative interpretation. regarding the expected interaction between
chaos and supportive parental responses to emotions (h3), the anticipated
interaction effect was not significant.

 

thus, the current study's findings for non-supportive (but not supportive) parent
responses suggest that as children enter the middle childhood years at 6 years of
age—but not toward the end of middle childhood at 9 years of age—chaos may
interfere with the child's ability to learn appropriate er skills in parenting

environments that are low in non-supportive behaviors. in the supplemental
responses suggest tal as cnligren enter une miagie criignoog years al 0 years of

age—but not toward the end of middle childhood at 9 years of age—chaos may
interfere with the child's ability to learn appropriate er skills in parenting
environments that are low in non-supportive behaviors. in the supplemental
analyses in which we tested for potential child effects of er on parental responses
to emotions, the interaction effects between supportive responses and chaos as
well as non-supportive responses and chaos were observed again only for chaos
at 6 years. thus, whether testing for statistical ‘parent’ or ‘child’ effects in the
association between parental responses to emotions and children's er, chaos
may disrupt or overwhelm er socialization and self-regulation processes (in
children and parents alike), weakening the statistical effects at higher levels of
chaos and strengthening their effects at lower levels of chaos (deater-

deckard, 2014; evan et al., 2005; vernon-feagans et al., 2016). that is, at higher
levels of chaos, the potential effects of parent reactions to their child's emotions
seem to be overwhelmed, although the link between parent response and child
er appears to be operating at lower levels of chaos.

 

 

bringing together the statistical tests we conducted, the results, and the prior
empirical evidence and theories, it is probably most useful to think about the
family processes we are studying as bidirectional, with child er and parental
responses to child emotion influencing each other over time and across various
situations (morris et al., 2007). though the emotion socialization processes

highlighted above are thought to reflect parenting influences on children’s
devalanment children are not naccive rerinients nf thnce eynerianras rather
responses to child emotion influencing each other over time and across various

situations (morris et al., 2007). though the emotion socialization processes
highlighted above are thought to reflect parenting influences on children’s
development, children are not passive recipients of those experiences. rather,
they also affect their environments, and their behaviors evoke differentiated
responses from their family members. children's characteristics, including how
often they express emotions and how well they regulate those emotions, can
affect the ways in which parents respond to their children’s emotions. if the child
is not well-regulated and has frequent emotional outbursts when experiencing
negative situations, the parent may have more difficulty responding supportively
to their child's negative emotions. furthermore, these bidirectional processes of
child and parent self-regulation may be most evident when household chaos
levels are lower but become overwhelmed and no longer functional at higher
levels of chaos (deater-deckard, 2014).

 

4.1 age differences in effects

there was no evidence to suggest household chaos moderated the links between
parent responses to emotions and child er at 9 years of age, regardless of
whether the 6-year variables were included in the equation. why might chaos
operate as a moderator of er socialization processes at 6 years of age, but not

9 years of age? there are several potential interpretations. firstly, this may reflect
areal developmental shift in the potential modulating role of the broader

household enviranment as children move throuch middle childhood (eo fram 6
operate as a moderator of er socialization processes at 6 years of age, but not

9 years of age? there are several potential interpretations. firstly, this may reflect
areal developmental shift in the potential modulating role of the broader
household environment. as children move through middle childhood (e.g., from 6
to 9 years of age, as in our study), they gradually increase the size of their peer
networks-social relationships that contribute to er development beyond the
effects of the home environment (e.g., contreras et al., 2000; penela et al., 2015;
trentacosta & shaw, 2009). in addition, as children move across middle
childhood, they continue to become more familiar with and integrated into a
school context that provides novel influences on er skill development (bardack &
widen, 2019; kwon et al., 2017). thus, when comparing parenting processes and
links with er development at 6 years compared to 9 years, the home environment
may be a more substantial source of socialization.

asecond potential explanation is that children become more resilient to, and less
affected by, a chaotic household environment as they develop across middle
childhood. for example, children growing up in chaotic environments may find it
harder to learn developmentally and situationally appropriate ways to express
and regulate their emotions when they are younger. as individual differences in
children's parenting environments and their own er skills become more stable
across childhood, they may also become less easily affected by the potential
disruptive effects of an unpredictable home environment. thus, as they became
older, the direct association between child er and parent responses to negative

 

across childhood, they may also become less easily affected by the potential
disruptive effects of an unpredictable home environment. thus, as they became
older, the direct association between child er and parent responses to negative
emotions may be a consistent, unmoderated process that is not affected by
broader household context factors such as the level of chaos. finally, the lack of
significant interaction effects at age 9 years may simply reflect that the
moderating effect of household chaos is a weak effect that does not replicate
when tested repeatedly.

4.2 caveats and conclusions

there are some limitations that should be considered. firstly, maternal reports
were the sole source of information. therefore, the findings and effect sizes are
likely affected to some degree by method and informant bias. this is
consequential, because although the current results may be informative with
regard to maternal perceptions (of the child, of their own responses to the child's
emotions, and of the levels of household chaos), they may not generalize to other
informants’ views, or to broader and more ‘objective’ measurement of family
processes and contexts over time. also, there may be systematically varying (but
unmeasured) factors such as depression and anxiety, that alter maternal
perceptions of their responses and their child's emotion regulation skills. we
would encourage readers to interpret the current results in that light—that our
findings pertain to how it is that mothers perceive and understand these family

perceptions of their responses and their child's emotion regulation skills. we
would encourage readers to interpret the current results in that light—that our
findings pertain to how it is that mothers perceive and understand these family
processes. future research should utilize multiple methods and informants (e.g.,
tasks; observers; other caregivers—e.g,, fathers and grandparents) to minimize
the impact of a mono-method bias on the results, and to permit formal testing of
the degree to which subjective perceptions of these processes matter. recent
research suggests that fathers’ emotion socialization skills benefitted children's
behavior (havighurst et al., 2019) and that mothers’ and fathers’ emotion
socialization strategies might differentially impact behavior across siblings
(yaremych & volling, 2018).

 

secondly, the internal consistency coefficients for the er and household chaos
scales were in the 0.6 range, which are below the standard threshold for what is
considered a reliable measure (nunnally & bernstein, 1994). this means that our
ability to detect significant effects was compromised and should be taken into
consideration when interpreting our results.

thirdly, even though we utilized a two-wave longitudinal design, the data were
correlational, so inferences of causality were not possible. future research should
consider including three or more waves of data (to more thoroughly address
potential temporal precedence of effects in longitudinal data), and to better
analyze the potential bidirectional processes within mother and child dyads over

finally, although there was some diversity in the study sample, it was quite
homogeneous and not representative with respect to race and ethnicity of
families in the united states. the processes we examined operate in families and
for individuals who are embedded in cultures. emotion socialization messages
may be delivered in different ways and with somewhat different meanings, in
distinct cultural and ethnic groups (halberstadt & lozada, 2011; morris

et al,, 2017). culture affects the ways in which parents and children interact and
express emotions, and how adults and children alike interpret and react to
others’ emotions (emde et al., 1991; morris et al., 2007; saarni, 1990). it will be
essential in future research to include adequate representation of ethnic diversity
in the samples, to address this shortcoming in the current study and literature.

 

these limitations aside, the current study adds to the growing literature on
parenting and family processes and children's er development in middle
childhood. although the moderating effect of household chaos was not present at
both time points in the current study, the effect was significant at the age of

six years (even when controlling for family ses indicators), providing preliminary
evidence to fuel future research on chaos and child er development. our results

both time points in the current study, the effect was significant at the age of

six years (even when controlling for family ses indicators), providing preliminary
evidence to fuel future research on chaos and child er development. our results
suggest that higher levels of chaos may overwhelm or subsume the proximal
parent-child relationship processes of er socialization. the current study adds
additional impetus for considering household chaos as a critical feature of family
resources and functioning, and as a potential target for prevention and
intervention efforts given that many aspects of household routines and the
physical environment can be modified with adequate supports in place (cripe &
venn, 1997; wachs & evans, 2010; weitzman et al., 2013; whitesell et al., 2015).

as a supplemental set of analyses, we examined whether there was any evidence
of potential statistical bidirectional ‘child effects’ of child er on parenting
responses to emotions. we estimated the three equations described above, with
a key modification: child er was examined as a statistical predictor of maternal
non-supportive and supportive responses to emotions as dependent variables.
we used multivariate multiple regression to estimate the additive and interactive
effects of statistical predictors (i.e., child er, household chaos) of maternal
supportive and non-supportive responses in the same equation. three equations
were estimated—at 6 years, at 9 years, and at 9 years with 6-year variables also
included as predictors. the results are presented in supplemental results.
overall, the pattern of results was very similar to those reported above for the
statistical prediction of child er—clear evidence of direct associations between
child er and parent responses, and little evidence for a consistent interaction
effect between child er and chaos at 6 years and 9 years.

to test the study hypotheses, we centered all predictors by standardizing, then,
used multiple standard (simultaneous) and hierarchical regression analyses to
estimate the additive and interactive statistical effects (i.e., maternal supportive
or non-supportive responses [analyzed together], household chaos) in the
prediction of variance in child er. three sets of equations were estimated: one
standard regression equation for variables at 6 years, a second standard
regression equation for variables at 9 years without 6-year variables included as
predictors, and a third hierarchical regression equation for variables at 9 years
with 6-year variables included as predictors. we first ran each equation with all
covariates included (i.e., maternal and paternal education and employment
status; child sex), then, dropped non-significant covariates, re-estimated the
equation, and interpreted the equation with only significant covariates included.

three cohorts (75% of the entire study; one cohort lacked data collection at the
age of six years). the cohorts were recruited during infancy equally using mailing
lists, media advertisements, flyers, and word of mouth from two research
locations in the united states (a rural town in south central appalachia and a mid-
sized city in the mid-atlantic region). each research location recruited half of the
participants in the longitudinal study. the recruitment criteria for infants included
full gestation, typical birth weight, and having no prenatal or birth complications.
prior to the 6-year assessment, these two cohorts also had lab visits at 5, 10, 24,
36, and 48 months.

at the age of six, the sample included 277 mother-child pairs, but there were 53
who were missing some or all data at the age of nine. we compared this sub-
group who had missing data at 9 years (n = 53) to the sub-group that had
complete data at both waves (n = 224). there were no statistically significant
mean differences for child er, parent responses to emotion, home environment,
parental education, and parental employment status (p-values for independent
samples ¢ tests ranged from .224 to .915).

we used listwise deletion of missing data across both waves, to select a sample
for analyses that included 224 mothers. listwise deletion is the simplest method

when data are not missing completely at random (mcar). we used little's
algorithm for testing mcar (rhemtulla & little, 2012), and the data met the
assumption of mcar. therefore, we retained the simple listwise deletion method.

participants were recruited from a rural town in virginia and a mid-size city in
north carolina in the united states. for the current study, 50.4% of children were
male, and the remaining 49.6% were female. children were 6.63 years old on
average at the 6-year time point (sd = 0.42) and 9.30 years old on average at the
9-year time point (sd = 0.40). mothers reported on the race of themselves and
their children; these were reported to be the same within each family. the
participants were predominantly white (78%), with 14% identifying as african
american, 4% as multi-racial, and 1% as asian.

parental education varied widely. of the mothers, 2.2% had not completed high
school, 6.7% had a high school diploma, 24.7% had a 2-year college degree or had
completed some college, 35.9% had completed a 4-year degree, and 30.5%
completed an advanced graduate or professional degree. among the fathers,
1.8% completed only elementary school, 7.6% had not completed high school,
14.8% had a high school diploma, 20.6% completed a 2-year college degree or
some college, 21.6% had a 4-year degree, and 33.6% completed an advanced
degree.

2.2 procedure

at the beginning of each lab visit, signed consent was obtained from the mothers,
and verbal assent was obtained from the children. prior to the lab visits, mothers
completed a set of questionnaires regarding themselves, their child, and their
home environment, and demographics. for each assessment, mothers received
an honorarium, and children were given an honorarium and a small gift. the lab
visit was 2.5 hr. for 238 mothers at the age of six and 200 mothers at age 9,
questionnaires were collected in the context of the research lab visits. for 39
mothers at the age of six and 49 mothers at age 9, questionnaires were mailed to
the families because they had moved away from the local area or were
unavailable for a research lab visit. those mothers completed the questionnaires
at home and mailed them back with a signed consent form. for mailed
questionnaires, mothers received a small honorarium.

 

data analyses were conducted using spss v.23 (ibm corporation). out of our final
sample (n = 224), we compared the sub-group of mothers who completed the
questionnaire during a lab visit (n = 195 at the age of six, n = 190 at age 9) to the
sub-group that completed them by mail (n = 29 at the age of six, n = 34 at age 9)

on the main studv variables. there were some statistically significant mean
sample (n = 224), we compared the sub-group of mothers who completed the

questionnaire during a lab visit (n = 195 at the age of six, n = 190 at age 9) to the
sub-group that completed them by mail (n = 29 at the age of six, n = 34 at age 9)
on the main study variables. there were some statistically significant mean
differences. when compared to the ‘lab questionnaire’ mothers, the ‘mailed
questionnaire’ mothers reported less non-supportive responses at 6 years (t(222)
= 2.19, p =.03, cohen's d = 0.45); at 9 years, they reported more supportive (t(222)
= 2.78, p = .006, d = 0.60) and less non-supportive responses(t(222)= ~2.01, p =
.046, d= 0.39). we ran analyses with questionnaire completion method (e.g.,
completed in lab vs. home) included as a binary covariate and results did not
change; results are reported without this covariate.

 

2.3 measures

2.3.1 parent responses to emotion

mothers completed the coping with child negative emotions scale (ccnes; fabes
et al., 1990, 2002). prior research on the ccnes measure reports strong internal
consistency and construct validity, as well as high test-retest reliability (eisenberg
et al,, 1999; fabes et al., 2002). this questionnaire assesses how parents respond
to their children's emotional distress. it includes 12 scenarios in which their
children experience negative emotions (e.g., angry or sad) in public and private
situations, and mothers were asked to indicate how they would respond to each
scenario. each scenario has six responses, and mothers rated each response on

children experience negative emotions (e.g., angry or sad) in public and private
situations, and mothers were asked to indicate how they would respond to each
scenario. each scenario has six responses, and mothers rated each response on
7-point likert-type scale regarding their likelihood of reacting that way (i.e.,

1 = very unlikely, 4 = medium, 7 = very likely).

 

the measure includes six subscales: emotion-focused (i.e., strategies that focus
on the emotion causing child distress and help child identify source of stressors),
problem-focused (.e., behaviors that help the child solve the problem that caused
the distress), expressive encouragement (.e., responses that reinforce expression
of emotions to validate feelings), minimization (i.e., reduces the perceived
seriousness and importance of the situation), punitive (i.e., verbal or physical
punishment to stop the child's negative emotion expression), and distress (i.e.,
becoming emotionally upset oneself in response to child negative emotions).
following previous research, supportive and non-supportive composite scales
were calculated by combining three subscales (denham & kochanoff, 2002; fabes
et al., 2002; shadur & hussong, 2019); supportive responses (36 items,
cronbach's ain the current sample = .91 for both 6 years and 9 years) included
emotion-focused, problem-focused, and expressive encouragement, and non-
supportive responses (36 items, cronbach's a= .82 for 6 years and a =.86 for

9 years) included minimization, punitive, and distress responses.

2.3.2 child emotion regulation (er)

mothers completed the emotion regulation checklist (erc; shields &
icchetti, 1997) which assesses their children's er and emotionality according to
the parents’ perceptions. erc is an age-appropriate measure for 6 to 12 years old
(shields & cicchetti, 1995, 1997). we used the emotion regulation subscale that
includes eight items regarding expression of emotions, empathy, emotional self-
awareness, and the tendency to modulate emotional arousal (e.g., ‘is a cheerful
child’, ‘can say when he/she is angry’, ‘can wait for something when asked to do’).
the items were rated on a 4-point likert-type scale (1 = never, 2 = sometimes,

3 = often, 4 = almost always); these were summed to create an er scale score (8
items, cronbach's a = .63 for the children at both 6 years and 9 years).

 

2.3.3 household chaos

mothers completed the short version of the chaos, hubbub and order scale
(chaos; matheny et al., 1995) which is designed to assess the level of confusion
and disorganization in the child's home environment. the scale has been
validated against observer ratings of environmental conditions (deater-deckard
et al,, 2009; matheny et al., 1995). the short version consists of six items rated on
a 5-point likert-type scale (rather than the original instrument's binary (yes/no)

scale from the matheny et al. questionnaire). the short version was used in two
valludleu agaist uusei ver tauiigs ul enivif onin lar cotuiuutts (dedtel-deckat

et al,, 2009; matheny et al., 1995). the short version consists of six items rated on
a 5-point likert-type scale (rather than the original instrument's binary (yes/no)
scale from the matheny et al. questionnaire). the short version was used in two
studies in the u.k.: the twin early development study (pike et al., 2006) and the
sisters and brothers study (coldwell et al., 2006). mothers were asked to indicate
how much each statement describes their home environment. the questionnaire
cludes six items (e.g, ‘you can't hear yourself think in our home’, ‘it's a real zoo
in our home’, and ‘the atmosphere in our house is calm’ [reverse scored]). they
were measured on a 5-point scale (1 = definitely untrue, 5 = definitely true) and
were averaged to create an overall score (6 items, cronbach's a =.65 for 6 years
and a = .66 for 9 years).

 

 

2.3.4 covariates

we controlled for ses by using individual indicators of mother's and father's years
of education (1 = grade school, 2 = some high school, 3 = high school graduate,

4 = some college or 2-year college, 5 = college graduate of 4 years of college,

6 = master's degree, 7 = ph.d. or m.d. or other doctoral degree), and employment
status (0 = not employed, 1 = employed). we also controlled for the sex of the
child (1 = male, 2 = female).

descriptive statistics and bivariate correlations were computed. these are
reported in table 1. all variables showed some skewness (i.e., skewness statistic
from 40.33 to 0.86) but approximated a normal distribution spanning the entire
range of each scale. of particular interest was the mother-reported household
chaos score, given its key role as a tested moderator in the current study. it was
slightly skewed toward the ‘lower chaos’ end of the scale, with the m and sds at
both time points being below the scale midpoint of 3.00. nevertheless, the
distribution was wide, spanning nearly the entire range of possible scores (one
standard deviation covered two-thirds of a point on the 5-point scale). the
distribution was very similar to the distribution reported in several other studies
in the united states and the u.k. that have used the same version of the
instrument (coldwell et al., 2006; deater-deckard et al., 2009, 2012). household
chaos, along with the two mother-reported response to emotions scales and the
mother-reported child er scale, showed moderate longitudinal stability from 6- to
9-years (i.e., rs from .55 to .67, p <.01).

 

table 1. correlations and descriptive statistics
although we did not anticipate finding evidence of other interaction patterns (e.g.,
negative parenting links being weaker at higher levels of chaos; positive parenting
links being stronger at higher levels of chaos), our analysis approach permitted
detection of such effects if they were present. in addition, the emphasis in the
current two-wave study (6- and 9-years) was on parent-reported chaos and
parental responses to emotions as statistical predictors of variance in parent-
reported child er—in line with some of the socialization theories and empirical
studies of er development cited above (e.g., hurrell et al., 2015; mcquade &

effects’ on parenting also are likely to be operating (eisenberg, 1998; morris

et al, 2007). poorly regulated child emotions and behaviors (e.g., emotional
reactivity; attention deficits; hyper-impulsivity) are well-established as statistical
predictors over time of harsher and less supportive parenting behavior (te brinke
et al. 2017; zvara et al., 2018). therefore, we also conducted supplemental
analyses, testing for potential additive and interactive effects of child er and
household chaos, in the prediction of parental responses to emotions.

1 introduction

one essential component of successful development is learning to regulate
emotional responses in socially appropriate and adaptive ways (denham

et al., 2003, 2014; eisenberg et al., 2002; halberstadt et al., 2001; morris

et al., 2007, 2017). emotion regulation (er) is defined as children's management
of their emotional experiences and expressions that allow then to function
appropriately with an optimal level of engagement (dunsmore et al., 2013; kim-
spoon et al., 2013; rogers et al., 2016). these critical er skills are particularly

difficulty in regulating negative emotions such as anger and sadness is linked to
emotional and behavioral problems (cicchetti et al., 1995; eisenberg et al., 2001;
frick & morris, 2004; morris et al., 2007; silk, steinberg & morris, 2003). er
development is supported and enhanced through learning that occurs in
socialization interactions and relationships with parents (morris et al., 2007, 2017;
rutherford et al., 2015)—yet, these processes may be distinct depending on the
broader family context (e.g., resources, stressors). the first goal of the current
study was to examine individual differences in parent responses to emotion and
children’s er at two different time points in middle childhood (from 6 to 9 years of
age). specifically, we tested whether better children's er skills would be positively
associated with mothers' supportive responses to emotion, and would be
negatively associated with mothers’ non-supportive responses to emotion. the
second goal was to test whether the links between parent responses to emotion
and children’s er varied as a function of the specific contextual factor of
household chaos—an understudied, potentially modifiable, environmental factor.

 

1.1 parent responses to emotion and children's emotion
regulation development

parents’ coping with and responses to their own child's negative emotions have
been identified as a key feature of the family context, because it consistently
relates to children's developing er skills and deficits (fabes et al., 2002; morgan
et al, 2010; pintar breen et al., 2018; song & trommsdorff, 2016). parents play an

relates to children's developing er skills and deficits (fabes et al., 2002; morgan
et al., 2010; pintar breen et al., 2018; song & trommsdorff, 2016). parents play an
important role in emotion communication and socialization of er skills in
childhood, from the time children first begin to express their needs and desires
(eisenberg et al., 1996, 1998; fabes et al., 2002; pintar breen et al., 2018). children
model the emotions and er processes learned both directly and indirectly from
parents (eisenberg et al., 1996, 1998; morris et al., 2007, 2017).

more specifically, parents can influence how children respond to and cope with
emotionally evocative situations by reacting to children's emotions, discussing
emotions, and expressing their own emotions (eisenberg et al., 1998; hurrell

et al,, 2015; perry et al., 2020). their reactions to their child's displays of negative
emotions provide rich opportunities for emotion socialization and can directly
influence children's developing emotion management skills. parent-child
discussions of emotions assist children's development of emotion-related
knowledge, language and skills (eisenberg et al., 1998; hurrell et al., 2015).
parents help their children to verbally label their own emotions, empathize with
and validate their children's emotions, and help children to problem solve by
providing specific suggestions for coping with negative emotions (eisenberg,
1998; gottman et al., 1997; morris et al., 2007; perry et al., 2020). through these
various socialization experiences with parents, children hone their emotional

‘ills and develop internal representations of emotions
tol copiniy wilit tega tive ef ouutts (cisenuete,

1998; gottman et al., 1997; morris et al., 2007; perry et al., 2020). through these
various socialization experiences with parents, children hone their emotional
expression and regulation skills and develop internal representations of emotions
that define and support their regulation across a wide range of situations (morris
et al. 2007, 2017; saarni et al., 1990, 2007). a number of studies have shown that
individual differences in parents' responses to children's emotions can affect
children’s regulation of their own emotional states. for example, in a small
longitudinal study of 5- to 8-year-olds, parents’ emotion-coaching behaviors were
associated with children's er (gottman et al., 1996). in a subsequent study of 9- to
15-year-olds, youth who had more effective self-regulation of emotions and
behavior reported higher levels of parental emotional support (morris &

age, 2009). these two studies exemplify the wide range of developmental periods
and constructs that have been examined in the parenting and child er
development literature.

      
     

 

several consistent findings have emerged in the literature regarding parental
supportive and non-supportive responses to child emotions—the focus of the
current study. parents who respond to their child's emotions in supportive ways
contribute positively to the development of children’s social and emotional
competencies, including er (eisenberg et al., 1991; mcquade & breaux, 2017;
morris et al., 2017). supportive parental responses focus on children's emotions
and encourage appropriate expression of emotions and problem-solving

strategies (fahes et al_ 2002) these tvnes of sunnortive narenting hehaviors to
competencies, including er (eisenberg et al., 1991; mcquade & breaux, 2017;

morris et al., 2017). supportive parental responses focus on children's emotions
and encourage appropriate expression of emotions and problem-solving
strategies (fabes et al., 2002). these types of supportive parenting behaviors to
emotion are more common among parents who have greater awareness of
children's emotions and who exhibit more effective emotion socialization
practices—and their children exhibit better social-emotional adjustment and
regulation skills. these findings have been observed across early development—
in toddlers, preschoolers, and school-age children (acar et al., 2019; morris

et al., 2007).

  

one interpretation is that parents who are warm and responsive are more aware
of their children's emotions, and therefore, are more effective in helping the child
learn to regulate and appropriately express their emotions (houltberg et al., 2016;
morris et al., 2007, 2017). further, if parents are supportive when children
express negative emotions, children may be less likely to become distressed and
better able to manage their emotional reactions in the future. they learn
appropriate strategies for handling their emotionally driven behaviors by
processing parents' messages and other relevant information (acar et al., 2019;
fabes et al., 2001). er strategies—such as reframing a frustrating situation,
redirecting attention, validating a child's emotions, and helping the child to
problem solve to regulate an emotion—have been linked to children's coping and
er across early and middle childhood (eisenberg et al., 1996; gottman &

redirecting attention, validating a child's emotions, and helping the child to
problem solve to regulate an emotion—have been linked to children's coping and
er across early and middle childhood (eisenberg et al., 1996; gottman &

declaire, 1997; morelen et al., 2016; morris et al., 2007, 2011).

 

 

 

in contrast, parents’ non-supportive reactions, such as ignoring the emotion or
using punitive control strategies, may impede the development of social-
emotional competencies and er in children (fabes et al., 2001; mcelwain

et al,, 2007; mcquade & breaux, 2017; morris et al., 2017). non-supportive
parental responses to emotion include devaluing the child's problem, using
punishment, and showing distress when the child expresses negative emotions
(fabes et al., 2002). in response to minimizing and punishing parenting behaviors,
children may learn to suppress negative emotions rather than appropriately
express them, and otherwise struggle with internal regulation of emotion
experiences that can lead to an increase in negative emotionality and arousal
(gross & levenson, 1993; morris et al., 2007; perry et al., 2020). also, the parents
who feel distressed when faced with their children's negative emotional
expressions are unlikely to support their children and more likely to control their
children’s negative emotional displays by punishing or minimizing them, which in
turn may lead children to suppress their emotions until they lose control. thus,
children may display decreased social and emotional competence (fabes

et al., 2002).

prior evidence suggests that parental minimization of their child's emotions is.
associated with children's avoidance and angry outbursts (eisenberg et al., 1996;
morris et al., 2007; snyder et al., 2003). punitive parental responses to emotion
have been associated with children's poorer social-emotional competence and
er, with greater reliance on avoidance or revenge-seeking behaviors (eisenberg &
fabes, 1994; jones et al., 2002; morris et al., 2007). parents' distressed responses
to children's negative emotions also have been linked with children's poorer
emotional and behavioral adjustment and functioning (cassidy et al., 1992). one
important caveat is that most of the literature on supportive and non-supportive
emotion socialization practices has relied on studies of white families. emotion
socialization behaviors, and their associations with variation in child er, may vary
depending on cultural context.

 

1.2 household context: order or chaos

parental emotion socialization behaviors operate within a broader household
context that also impacts children's development. in the current study, we
focused on an important and potentially modifiable, yet, understudied, aspect of
this context—household chaos. prior evidence suggests that children's er
development is optimized in home environments that are typically calm and

focused on an important and potentially modifiable, yet, understudied, aspect of
this context—household chaos. prior evidence suggests that children's er
development is optimized in home environments that are typically calm and
predictable. in such contexts, children may be better situated to experience and
learn from emotion socialization and other parent-child relationship processes
that support er development (bowes et al., 2010; coldwell et al., 2006). in
contrast, homes that are crowded, noisy, and lacking in routines (i.e., are ‘chaotic’)
are more often emotionally and physiologically distressing, and there may be
fewer opportunities, or more opportunities but less capacity, for socializing
adaptive er strategies and skills (berry et al., 2016; coldwell et al., 2006; dumas

et al,, 2005; garrett-peters et al., 2016, 2019; marsh et al., 2020; vernon-feagans
et al., 2016).

 

 

higher levels of chaos consistently are associated with harsher parenting, more
parenting stress, more reliance on ineffective and reactive discipline, and less
parental sensitivity and responsiveness to children's needs (dumas et al., 2005;
garrett-peters et al., 2019; smith et al., 2001; tucker et al., 2018; vernon-feagans
et al,, 2016; wachs & corapci, 2003; zvara et al., 2014). the literature also strongly
implicates household chaos as a correlate and statistical predictor of children's
and adolescents’ social-emotional and cognitive development outcomes (e.g.,
behavioral and emotional problems, poorer social cue detection, lower iq, poorer
physical health; dumas et al., 2005; hughes & ensor, 2009; petrill et al., 2004; pike
et al,, 2006; tucker et al., 2018; vernon-feagans et al., 2016; wachs &

 

behavioral and emotional problems, poorer social cue detection, lower iq, poorer
physical health; dumas et al., 2005; hughes & ensor, 2009; petrill et al., 2004; pike
et al,, 2006; tucker et al., 2018; vernon-feagans et al., 2016; wachs &

corapci, 2003).

the interpretation of these links between household chaos, parenting, and
children’s functioning is that if they are chronic, higher levels of distractions and
unpredictability in chaotic households may alter (i.e., modulate or statistically
moderate) the links between parenting behavior and children's functioning. these
links reflect the socialization and self-regulation processes that are fundamental
to children's healthy development (blair et al., 2007; deater-deckard et al., 2012;
erickson et al., 2003; evans et al., 2005; vernon-feagans et al., 2016). with regard
to the current study's emphasis on child er, there is reason to believe that the
statistical association between parenting behaviors and children's self-regulation
may operate differently at higher versus lower levels of household chaos (hughes
& ensor, 2011; hughes et al., 2014; vernon-feagans et al., 2016; wachs &

evans, 2010).

 

 

two possibilities for the direction of moderation have been posited (coldwell
et al,, 2006). firstly, the link between negative parenting behavior and children's
functioning may be strengthened in chaotic environments. this is because chaotic
environments increase arousal and reactive behavior. secondly, the link between
positive parenting behaviors and children's functioning may be weakened in

functioning may be strengthened in chaotic environments. this is because chaotic
environments increase arousal and reactive behavior. secondly, the link between
positive parenting behaviors and children's functioning may be weakened in
chaotic environments. this is because uncertainty, noise, and distractions may
interfere with effective behavioral and emotion socialization processes.

there also are two alternative predictions not compatible with findings reported
by coldwell and colleagues (2006). thirdly, negative parenting links may be
weakened in chaotic environments, because those processes are overridden by
the effects of a chaotic home environment. fourthly, positive parenting links may
be strengthened in chaotic environments, because it is in such contexts that
positive parenting becomes even more important. few studies have tested for
these interaction effects, but the evidence so far supports the first prediction: that
higher levels of chaos can amplify the potentially deleterious effects of non-
supportive and harsh parenting on child and adolescent adjustment and
functioning (chen et al., 2014; coldwell et al., 2006; tucker et al., 2018).

1.3 the current study: middle childhood

our study focuses on identifying the potential interactive effects of household
chaos and parental responses to children's emotions, with a focus on middle

childhood. parental strategies to teach er differ with the age of the chi
(eisenberg et al., 1999). in early childhood, parents typically begin to teach

resulation strategies. and children's self-regulation skills gradually improve across
chaos and parental responses to children's emotions, with a tocus on middle

childhood. parental strategies to teach er differ with the age of the chi
(eisenberg et al., 1999). in early childhood, parents typically begin to teach
regulation strategies, and children's self-regulation skills gradually improve across
early and middle childhood (eisenberg & morris, 2002). in early childhood, much
of the children’s er happens with direct support from parents’ interventions and
actions. as children develop more sophisticated cognitive and emotional skills
later in childhood, they gradually become better at regulating their emotions
independently (morris et al., 2007; lissa et al., 2019). this developmental
progression and the emotion socialization history within the family may be
particularly important for supporting the child's successful transition to all-day
schooling, a context that requires autonomous self-regulation of emotions
without direct support from parents (nelson et al., 2013; sroufe, 1996).

 

 

most of the work cited above has focused on early childhood and the transition to
middle childhood, but there has been less attention paid to the associations
between parent responses and children's er across middle childhood, with no
prior studies examining this in the context of household chaos. furthermore,
there is very little prior research examining longitudinal data. in light of theory
and the literature reviewed above (most notably, the predictions offered in
coldwell et al., 2006), in the current study, we tested three hypotheses, each

coldwell et al., 2006), in the current study, we tested three hypotheses, each
involving statistical prediction of parent-reported er skills at 6 years of age and
again at 9 years of age (with and without the age of six-year predictors included):
supportive responses and negatively associated with mothers’ less non-
supportive responses, as well as lower household chaos. chaos statistically
moderated the link between non-supportive parental responses to emotion
and child er, but only at 6 years of age. the strength of the link between child
er and non-supportive parental responses to emotions was strong only at
lower levels of household chaos. at the beginning of middle childhood, family
processes linking parent responses to child emotions and children's
developing er may not function at higher levels of household chaos.

parents’ responses to children's negative emotional states play a key role in
the socialization of emotion regulation skills in childhood. much of the prior
research on child er has focused on early development using cross-sectional
designs. the current study addresses these gaps by using a longitudinal
design to examine individual differences of er at two times points in middle
childhood. we examined the development of children's er by testing
hypotheses about the interplay of parent response to emotions and
household chaos in the prediction of individual differences in children's er.
participants were the mothers of children at 6 and 9 years of age among 224
families in a socioeconomically diverse sample that was part of an ongoing
longitudinal study. mothers completed questionnaires regarding themselves,
their children, and their home environment. mothers’ reports of better child
