the personal variables of being detained or knowing someone who was
deported. having undocumented contacts was no longer significantly
related to social isolation, but being undocumented and being or knowing
someone who was detained and deported were. as would be expected,
direct or vicarious experiences with being detained or deported are strongly
related to social isolation.

though not significant in the first two models, education and employment
are now significantly and negatively related to social isolation. it seems
friication and emninvment have a miticating affect an carial isalatinn that
data were collected in 2012, they have special relevance today, as the trump
administration has resurrected programs previously shelved due to racial
profiling concerns, reinstituted the secure communities program, and
significantly expanded interior enforcement. in addition, local law
enforcement agencies, like those in maricopa county, arizona, continue
their racial profiling of latinas/os in routine policing (cna 2019). in this
climate, the consequences of subnational enforcement regimes have
become critical to current legal and policy debates. our analysis shows that

 
   

icant affarte an
‘spore inicieaseu

 

sut ns my po ee a heme cot es pomce
social isolation, including 39 percent who were afraid to leave the house
because local law enforcement was involved in immigration enforcement
activities. surprisingly, there was no significant difference between women
and men on these individual social isolation variables.

in documenting these trends, our article demonstrates the gender
homogenizing effects that current enforcement practices have on latina/o
immigrants in the united states. whereas immigrant women, by virtue of
gendered expectations, have historically been anchors of community
increased their social isolation (fear of leaving the house, feeling isolated,
and feeling under suspicion). further regression results showed that of the
three social isolation variables, having children was most significant in fear
of leaving the house.

in all models, phoenix was the most significant city, which attests to the
climate of fear that has plagued the phoenix latina/o community. houston
is also significant in all three models, but the relationship with social
isolation is not quite as strong as in phoenix. it is important to note that

welcoming for latina/o immigrants.

as expected, being born in the united states and, thus, presumably being a
us citizen also led to decreased social isolation, while having conducted the

 

interview in spanish led to increased social isolation. finally, social isolation
was most related to being undocumented, to knowing someone who had
been deported, or to having more interactions with law enforcement

officials in the past year. despite some political rhetoric, especially in the

   

obama administration, that secure communities, its successor, the pep, and

other similar programs like 287(9) were not intended to target noncriminal
exclusion by withdrawing from their community. this increase in social

 

isolation is especially troubling as it has critical socioeconomic impacts and
is linked to poor health outcomes and reduced access to health care
(livingston et al. 2008; hagan, rodriguez, and castro 2011; negi 2013;
martinez et al, 2015), especially in immigrant-hostile contexts like phoenix
(szkupinski quiroga, medina, and glick 2014). a nationwide survey of
educators (ee and gandara 2020) parallels our findings; 45% of educators
had observed decreased parental involvement among immigrant children

 

 

 

resulting from increased immigration enforcement. this decrease may

race, ethnicity, and gender. the enforcement climate today, by increasing
immigrants’ “deportability” (de genova 2004), affects the lives of latina/o
immigrants and their communities so profoundly that it is altering long-
standing social dynamics, to the detriment of latina immigrants. an aspect
of settlement that gave these women a social advantage and perhaps even a
sense of belonging was their ability to forge networks beyond the family to
interact with institutions, create community, and advocate for their rights
and those of their families (hondagneu-sotelo 1994; martinez 2010;

improvements in other areas of their lives (e.g., employment, education,
etc.), latina immigrant women's lives can be further marginalized and
gender inequalities exacerbated in the face of expanded enforcement
programs such as secure communities.

while our study focused on four large us cities, similar patterns of internal
immigration enforcement are taking place around the globe. the united
kingdom (aliverti 2016; bowling and westenra 2018), malta (mainwaring
201?) the netherlands (van der wode van der | ein and niiland 2914)

 

especially among those traditionally involved in actively building social ties,
should be a wider warning of the possible deleterious effects of such
enforcement strategies.

significant, but having children is no longer significant. therefore,
undocumented status, connections with undocumented individuals, and
perceptions of law enforcement involvement have greater impact on social

 

isolation than having children. females and males are still not significantly
different from each other in feelings of social isolation, meaning that
women's networks may have lost their strength and are now undermined.

included 11 questions such as whether the respondent or their friends or
family members in the past year had been stopped by police officers or
other law enforcement officials, asked for their immigration papers,
threatened with deportation, and insulted or verbally disrespected. a
question also asked whether in the past two years any close friends or
family members had been deported.

for our analysis, we created several dummy variables including female,
phoenix, spanish (whether the interview was conducted in spanish), born in
involved = 3). summative scales were created for experiences with law
enforcement officials (variable name detained: range 0-11) and knowing
someone who is undocumented in the united states (relative, friend,
coworker, and household member; variable name undoccontacts: range 0-
4).

the three variables for the social isolation scale, which is the dependent

variable in our models, are (1) | feel afraid to leave my house because local
law enforcement officials are more involved in immigration enforcement, (2)

    

 

 

almost all respondents reported an increase in involvement by local law

enforcement (44 percent) or no change (50 percent). note, the “no change”
response is ambiguous, as this question asked whether there was a change
in local law enforcement involvement in the past two years while the 287(g)

 

program and other initiatives had been active for years before that and had
been vigorously enforced. 30 percent of respondents reported that at least
one close friend or family member had been deported in the past two years.

on average, respondents reported 2.2 incidents with a police officer or other

studies (hondagneu-sotelo 1994; menjivar 2000, 2002) showed that women
are able to build social networks that reduce social isolation. however,

 

 

intensified immigration enforcement seems to depress any advantage that
women had in building community through networks and, thus, reducing
social isolation. having children under age 18 was significantly related to
social isolation (r= .141, p = .000), with those having children being
significantly more likely to feel socially isolated. this finding differs from
previous research showing that having children increased immigrant

anumber of other variables were significantly related to social isolation. as
expected, positively related variables include spanish, mexico,
undoccontacts, undocumented, phoenix, employed, and detained.
negatively related variables were age, education, and bornus.

next, we ran t-tests and anova to compare means with social isolation
among the four cities (see table 2). the anova results showed that the
mean scores on social isolation were significantlv different amone the four
might show lower social isolation than men in cities with less immigration
enforcement, such as chicago and los angeles. this result might be

  

explained by increased anti-it

  

migrant rhetoric, even in cities with less
immigration enforcement and in national discourse. it could also be that
even though these cities have comparatively less stringent immigration
enforcement, at least by local law enforcement, the increased federal
immigration enforcement, especially as reported extensively through
spanish-language media (menjivar 2016), could be enough to reduce the

the 2017 revitalization of the controversial security communities program,
which requires local law enforcement to cooperate with federal immigration
officials in the united states, has made it urgent to better understand such
enforcement programs’ effects on the well-being of latinas/os, especially
the foreign-born. social isolation from increased immigration enforcement
can have significant impacts on economic, social, and health outcomes

 

that having children led to more social isolation for both women and men.
personal and vicarious experiences with immigration enforcement, as well
as living in phoenix and houston — two urban areas with the strictest
enforcement regimes — were strongly related to social isolation. our results
indicate that local authorities’ increased involvement in immigration
enforcement can lead to more social isolation for latina immigrants,
particularly those who have children, aligning their experiences with men's
and, thus, undermining latinas’ previously recognized role as bridges
between their families and social institutions and as community builders.
delegating its immigration powers to state and local governments, a
transformation most apparent in the granting of local law enforcement
agencies the power to enforce federal immigration provisions through the
287(g) and secure communities programs.! this “devolution” in immigration
enforcement (varsanyi 2010) has been accompanied by a turn to amore
punitive approach to enforcement strategies based on and sustained by a
dramatic increase in immigrant detention and deportation, as well as the
threat of deportation, or “deportability” (de genova 2004). these policies and

the 287(g) and secure communities programs has generated a constant
threat and fear of detention and deportation among undocumented (and
also lawful permanent resident) immigrants and their families (negi 2013;
dreby 2015). this constant threat has affected entire communities
throughout the united states (massey and sanchez 2010; menjivar and
abrego 2012; aranda, menjivar, and donato 2014; armenta 2017), with
important differences across contexts in experiences of deportability

nonimmigrants who fear their peers may be deported (santos and menjivar
2013). this constant fear has emotional and traumatic effects, particularly
among latina/o immigrants (gonzales and chavez 2012) and their families
(dreby 2015; menjivar et al. 2018), and negative effects on the mental and
emotional health of immigrant youth (gonzales, sudrez-orozco, and dedios
2013). this threat has also been found to positively predict stress among
immigrants in general (arbona et al. 2010). deportability has led immigrants,
especially latinas/os, to alter their daily routines to avoid detection (abrego

 

and pirtle 2018), as do women and men (golash-boza and hondagneu-
sotelo 2013; das gupta 2014). race and ethnicity also shape deportability’s

 

 

contours, with research finding that even though latina/o immigrants
comprise about two thirds of undocumented immigrants in the united
states, they make up approximately 95 percent of the detained and

deported (passel and cohn 2011; meni
2016). this situation has led scholars to highlight enforcement's racialized
character (donato and armenta 2011; eary 2013;

increased social isolation, in turn, contributes to weakening latina
immigrants’ links to social institutions and their ability to build community.
to examine this process, we analyze a random sample survey, conducted in
2012, of 2004 latinas/os in four large us cities (los angeles, california;

doing so, we highlight the multiple consequences of immigration
enforcement-related social isolation for latina immigrants and
nonimmigrants alike, including socioeconomic, health, and community-level
effects. as we show, living in fear affects the ability of documented and
undocumented latina immigrants both to establish formal and informal

zotust prograrrr wars
immigrant responsibility act of 1996 (iirira). it allows state and local law
enforcement agencies to enter into voluntary agreements with the federal

   

   

government to enforce immigration laws. as of 2019, 79 agreements were in
place with local governments in 21 states (https://www.ice.gov/287g). the us

 

secretary of homeland security reported that “from january 2006 through
september 2015, the 287(g) program led to the identification of more than
402,000 removable aliens, primarily through encounters at local jails” (kelly
2017). in 2009, the us immigration and customs enforcement agency (ice)

found, ice could choose to issue a “detainer” on that person, which required
the local agency to hold the person for 48 hours after their scheduled
release so that ice could interview the detainee and decide whether to start
deportation proceedings. despite ice's claims that secure communities was
a “simple and common-sense way to carry out ice's priorities” and that only
federal immigration agents were involved in immigration decisions under
the program,4 numerous reports have shown that secure communities

significantly increased local law enforcement agencies’ involvement in

such as homicide, kidnapping, sexual assault, cruelty toward child or spouse,
and more serious drug offenses, is belied by statistics that show that in
2012, of the 220,322 immigrants removed, only 61,348 were removed for
level-1 crimes, and 54,258 were noncriminals (gill 2013, 2061-62). although
secure communities began as a voluntary program, by 2011 the obama

 

administration had changed participation rules to make it mandatory for all

(american immigration council 2017). in july 2015, a successor program,
entitled the priority enforcement program (pep), began (american
immigration council 2017). pep created enforcement priorities to
supposedly focus on detaining immigrants who had committed serious
offenses (e.g., an aggravated felony, commission of a felony in which
immigration status was involved, or apprehension while attempting to enter
the united states) or had been involved in an “organized criminal gang” or

posed “a danger to national security” (https://www.ice.gov/pep). the ice

order also intensified and expanded enforcement beyond the border to the

participation in the 287(g) and secure communities programs due to
“findings of discriminatory policing practices.” in 2012, the us supreme
court ruled that most of sb 1070's provisions were unconstitutional
(guttentag 2012). however, the “show me your papers” provision remained
and required law enforcement officials to determine the legal status of
anyone arrested or detained if there was “reasonable suspicion” that the
individual was undocumented (arizona v. united states 2012; peard 2018).
the implementation of what remains of sb1070 is being monitored, and

only 42% of individuals screened through secure communities and later

comparison to houston and phoeni

 

, had “the largest percentage of
deportations of serious level 1 offenders” and about half the number of
“deportations that result[ed] from low-grade misdemeanors (level 3)"
(1214). given the differences in local police's participation in immigration
enforcement across the four metropolitan areas, we hope to shed light on
how differential enforcement practices affect latinas/os’ feelings of social

 

‘alation with notential imnactson_|atinas’ roles as cammunity builders as

 

whereby latina/o immigrants can be targeted by local law enforcement at
any time (abrego et al, 2017). under the initial secure communities
program, deportations throughout the united states increased 400 percent,
leading to “families torn apart by the removals of undocumented spouses,
parents, siblings, and children convicted only of non-violent crimes, traffic
violations, or other minor infractions” (ray 2011). these enforcement efforts
also exacerbated the climate of fear among latinas/os in the united states,
undermining trust in local law enforcement and a sense of community
2078).

despite these documented impacts, relatively little systematic research has

 

analyzed how social cleavages, such as race, social class, and gender,
intersect with such enforcement strategies. in particular, we know very little
about the gendered effects of secure communities and the pep, especially
whether women experience such enforcement differently. our study
addresses this gap by examining these gendered effects and asking whether

be more likely to tap into these networks because gendered expectations of

behavior place them as their families’ caretakers (menjivar 2002). these
social ties can aid women with childcare and help them access support
services, health care providers, as well as information about their children’s
education (menjivar 2000, 2002; delgado-gaitan 2005; martinez 2010;
valdez, padilla, and valentine 2013). in fact, research has found that after 10
years of us residence, immigrant latina mothers’ participation in their

 

 

 

 

 

children’s schools resembles that of their us-born counterparts (terriquez
2012). from their position as mothers, latina immigrants, regardless of legal
cleaning homes and lived in their employers’ homes (and, thus, isolated
from other co-ethnics) had significantly reduced networks and were cut off
from the benefits that these social ties bring (hagan 1998).

however, recent studies have shown that under conditions of increased
immigration enforcement and anti-immigrant climate, latina immigrants are
less likely to develop extended social networks (ornelas et al. 2009). latina
(and latino) immigrant parents under a regime of heightened immigration

enforcement report that their social networks are constantly changing and

 

interior enforcement elevates latina immigrants’ fear ene time in
public spaces or outside the home (gomez cervantes et al, 2018),
undermining the deployment of social ties (ayon 2017), creating mistrust in
social institutions (gomez cervantes et al. 2018) that can lead to
“institutional apathy” (estrada, ebert, and halla lore 2016), and decreasing
service utilization among latina/o immigrants (latz, lusk, and heyman
2019). a recent survey of educators (ee and gandara 2020) points to the

 

 

schmalzbauer 2014). for instance, hagan, rodriguez, and castro (2011)

 

 

 

found that north carolina's anti-immigrant climate kept latina immigrants
from attending community events or going to the park, library, or local
restaurants (see also schmalzbauer 2014). in other cases, latina immigrants
were found to rarely leave their homes, with several using the term
encerrada (closed in) to describe their work lives and general experiences in
the united states (hurtado de-mendoza et al. 2014; schmalzbauer 2014;
gomez cervantes et al. 2018). as a result, these women’s formal contacts

to align with newer destinations in their effects on latina immigrants’ social
isolation.

thus, focusing on secure communities’ effects on latina immigrants is
especially timely, given the trump administration's focus on detention,
deportation, and family separation, all of which affect immigrant women,
especially latinas, in specific ways. our understanding of these effects will
help shed light on the enhanced interior enforcement's long-term effects on

latina/o communities across the united states.
