sleep behaviors. on days that caregivers reported poorer sleep quality in
persons with ad, they self-reported poorer sleep quality, greater na, and
lower pa. similarly, on days that persons with ad were in bed for longer,
caregivers reported getting more sleep, and self-reported less na and
greater pa. these results are consistent with findings of retrospective
associations between sleep in persons with ad and na outcomes in
caregivers (arthur et al., 2018; mausbach et al., 2013; mohamed et al,,.2010).
although previous studies have outlined associations between daily

 

preceding night for the person with ad. pa supports recovery from negative
emotions (fredrickson et al., 2000) and can serve as a protective factor in
times of stress (ong et al., 2006). thus, itis important to bolster, protect, and
sustain pa in family caregivers.

furthermore, at the between-person level, whether caregivers experience
pa on a given day is more strongly associated with whether they and their
care recipient slept well the night before than with whether they and their
care recipient sleep well in general. this pattern is consistent with prior

dre time in gea gisplayed lower tevéis of na on average, which was in turn
associated with lower average caregiver na. thus, there are several
pathways from patient sleep disturbance to caregiver na. our findings are
consistent with retrospective associations between poorer sleep and worse

 

mood in healthy adult populations (alcantara et al., 2016; cho et al., 2008;
lee et al,, 2013) but illustrate the importance of prospective daily diary data

 

to identify which aspects of patient sleep—notably sleep quality and sleep
quantity—might be most important for caregiver outcomes.

(podsakoff et al,, 2003) and that caregivers reported sleep in the morning
and affect in the evening which reduces shared rater bias.

our assessment of disturbed sleep is based on subjective information
(american academy of sleep medicine, 2005), which is common in clinical
studies (edinger et al., 2004). subjective and objective sleep measures are
typically not correlated (rosa & bonnet, 2000) and provide unique data
about sleep quality and other variables. thus, these results may not

 

 

generalize to objective measures of sleep, such as polysomnography and

deena

difficulties (e.g., shin et al., 2005). we did not control for potential

 

associations between nps and caregiver ratings of mood and sleep and thus
cannot exclude nps as an alternate explanation for the association between
sleep difficulties in persons with ad and caregiver mood.

finally, the study sample size was small, which may affect the reliability of
parameter estimates (mcneish, 2017). however, the use of monte carlo
simulations to generate confidence intervals for estimates of indirect effects

improves the reliability of the outcomes of interest (i. direct effects). the

rather than on global judgments of sleep quality or behaviors. for some
patient-caregiver dyads, interventions might be implemented to improve
patient sleep, such as implementing daily exercise and increasing sleep
hygiene (irish et al,, 2015). for other dyads, aspects of disturbed sleep may
be unavoidable (e.g., being frequently awakened by the person with ad). in
these cases, respite care might be needed to provide the caregiver
opportunities for periodic uninterrupted sleep.

assessed in each model. whereas traditional approaches to mediation
require that both “a” and “b” pathways be significant to test for a significant
indirect effect, newer approaches argue that significance in the “a” and “b”
paths is not a prerequisite for mediation (e.g., hayes, 2009). multilevel

 

mediation analyses followed the guidelines described by preacher and
colleagues (preacher et al., 2010). this analytic approach allows for
decomposition of the observed data into within- and between-person levels,
individual means. confidence intervals for indirect effects were generated
using monte carlo simulations in mplus to appropriately test for
significance. we used the benjamini-hochberg procedure to control for
family-wise error for the remaining parameter estimates in mediation
models (e.g., a, b, and c’ paths).

rating covers six domains of cognitive and functional performance including,
memory, orientation, judgment and problem-solving, community affairs,

point scale (0 = healthy, 0.5 = very mild, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe
dementia) with higher values indicating increased severity of dementia

 

 

assess the degree to which caregivers perceive the responsibilities
associated with caregiving to have a negative impact on their health,
emotional functioning, finances, and personal and social life (zarit et al
1985). each item is rated for discomfort on a 5-point scale (0 = never; 4 =
nearly always); four items are reverse-scored (zarit et al,, 1980). the zbi has
been found to have good internal consistency reliability (a = 0.89; zarit et al,
1987). the zbi demonstrates good convergent validity (rs>.6) with measures

of caregiver life quality and depression and functional abilities in care

awakening, naps, medication intake, and overall sleep quality. caregivers
completed sleep diaries upon awakening to increase the accuracy of their
recall when they were interviewed in the morning. the independent
variables in the sleep diary for the caregiver were bedtime, time of
awakening, time to fall asleep (sleep latency), time being awake after sleep
onset (waso—wake after sleep onset), number of times being awakened by
the person with ad, sleep quality (1-5, “very poor” to “very good”), and
feeling well rested from sleep (1-5, “not at all” to “very much’). sleep timing
variables were used to calculate the total sleep time, tst = (time of _

and na (watson et al., 1988). items are rated for the past day on a 5-point

 

scale (1 = very slightly or not at all; 5 = extremely). the pa and na scales are
quasi-independent, with correlations ranging from -.12 to -.23 across
different time frames (watson et al., 1988). the panas has demonstrated
high internal consistency reliability, with .90 for pa and .87 for na for

 

different today ratings.

the current daily diary study determined associations between sleep, na,
and positive affect (pa) in persons with ad and the daily sleep, na, and pa of
attéct of the person with ad as mediators between sleep in persons with ad
and caregiver daily mood. for these mediational analyses, we hypothesized
that sleep disturbance in the person with ad would be associated with sleep
disturbance in the caregiver, which would in turn result in greater na and
lower pa for the caregiver the following day. likewise, we hypothesized that
sleep disturbance in the person with ad would be associated with greater
na and lower pa in the person with ad, which would in turn result in poorer
caregiver affect (e.g., greater na and/or lower pa). more information about
the daily fluctuations in sleep and affect in persons with ad—and

participants were recruited via flyers and press releases at senior centers
and via talks at local organizations, including support groups for caregivers
of persons with ad and the alzheimer's association massachusetts and new
york city chapters. this study used part of the eligibility criteria from the

et al,, 2006) for caregiver inclusion criteria. caregivers needed to provide

abstract

poor sleep in persons with alzheimer's disease (ad) is a common stressor
for family caregivers. retrospective reports support associations between
sleep disturbance in persons with ad and worse caregiver mood; however,
prospective associations between sleep in persons with ad and caregiver
outcomes have not been studied. the current study determined
associations between affect and sleep of persons with ad and their
caregivers using daily diary data. multilevel mediation models indicated that

an estimated 5.5 million individuals in the united states are diagnosed with
probable alzheimer's disease (ad), and this number is projected to grow to
13.8 million by 2050 (hebert et al., 2013). ad is a significant public health
concern due to the high costs associated with caring for persons with the
disease. in the united states, family members provide the majority of care
for persons with dementia (friedman et al., 2015). caring for a family

 

member with ad is stressful and is associated with psychological and
emotional hardship for caregivers (mausbach et al,, 2013; richardson et al.

 

 
 

2012) caras hurelan ic 3 camman raacan ta inctititinnaliza nareane u

tractenberg et al., 2005).

 

sleep disturbance is one of the most prominent stressors for family
caregivers of persons with ad. based on the transactional theory of stress
(e.g., barber et al,, 2014; lazarus & folkman, 1984), the daily stress
associated with sleep disturbance in persons with ad is hypothesized to
have adverse consequences for caregiver sleep and mental health. indeed,
up to 63% of spousal caregivers of persons with ad reported disturbed
nighttime sleep due to sleep behaviors (creese et al., 2008). caregivers for

persons with dementia renort more sleen disturbances camnared to
negative arrect (ina; lit et al, 2015; miccra 2016}. ihe current

     

prospective study builds on this work by providing some of the first
prospective data to determine how daily sleep characteristics in persons
with ad affect caregiver outcomes.
