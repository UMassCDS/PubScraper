abstract -

quantum critical points in quasiperiodic magnets can realize new universality classes, with
critical properties distinct from those of clean or disordered systems. here, we study quantum,
phase transitions separating ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases in the quasiperiodic q-
state potts model in 2 + 1d. using a controlled real-space renormalization group approach,
we find that the critical behavior is largely independent of g, and is controlled by an infinite-
quasiperiodicity fixed point. the correlation length exponent is found to be v = 1, saturating a
modified version of the harris-luck criterion,
