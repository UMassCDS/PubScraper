cardiomyopathy mutations impact the actin-activated
power stroke of human cardiac myosin
2021, biophysical journal

citation excerpt :
...because the actin-activated power stroke includes both the actin-
binding and lever arm rotation steps, itis possible that the
mutations could impact either of these steps. most models suggest
that lever arm rotation and the weak to strong actin-binding
transition occur simultaneously (11,56). thus, we propose that the
slowed actin-activated power stroke is associated with an overall
reduction in the rate of transition into the strongly bound states....

transient kinetic measurements

examination of the major steps in the actomyosin atpase
cycle was performed using transient kinetic analysis (18, 22,
64). an applied photophysics stopped-flow apparatus with a
dead time of 1.2 ms and 9.3-nm band pass was used for all
measurements. the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence was
monitored by exciting the sample at 290 nm and measuring
the emission with a 320-nm long-pass filter. the mantadp

the assay to determine the single-molecule mechanics and

minor modifications to accommodate the myosin v 11q
constructs. briefly, the myosin was adhered to a
nitrocellulose-coated coverslip with 3-m silica microspheres
serving as pedestals for the myosin. myosin was added at a

the surface was then blocked with bsa to prevent

streptavidin-coated 1-m silica microspheres, biotin/tritc-
labeled actin, oxygen scavengers, and 100 pm atp, in addition
to 60 mm kci, 1 mw egta, 4 mm mgcl, and 1 mm dtt at ph

attached to the optically trapped 1-1m microspheres and
stretched such that 3-4 pn of pretension was applied to the
filament. the two-trap stiffness of the assembly was 0.03
pn/nm. individual pedestals were interrogated by lowering
the bead-actin-bead assembly near the surface. only 1 in 12
pedestals displayed activity, ensuring we were in a single-
molecule regime. the data were collected at 5 khz and
analyzed to identify individual events using hidden markov

single-molecule laser trapping analysis

 

single-molecule binding events were identified by applying a
two-state hidden markov (hm) model to the running
variance and running mean of the raw trapping data using
the depmixs4 r package (70). the running variance and
running mean signals were treated as conditionally
independent in the hm model to allow for the detection of
events that produced zero displacement. ultimately, the hm
model categorized each window in either of two states,
which represented myosin being unattached or attached to
events that produced zero displacement. ultimately, the hm
model categorized each window in either of two states,
which represented myosin being unattached or attached to
an actin filament, respectively. unitary displacements were
determined by taking the maximum window value from the
running mean of each event.

the running windows were set at a window width (w) of 30
ms and moved 15-ms (w1,2) upon each advancement of the
running window. the half-overlapping windows decreased
the correlation between neighboring windows and provided
a data set that met the assumptions for the hm model's
transition matrix (67) increasing the model's ability to
reliably detect events. consequently, the sliding windows
decreased the time resolution of the trapping signal by a
factor of w1)2, resulting in an artificial instrumental dead time
of 15 ms. moreover, because events were identified based
upon the running windows, initial estimates of the event
durations were approximated (fon-app) by taking the product
of the number of windows (ny,) that comprised an event and
the conversion factor (w1,2) between the length of the
ouratasaas wereingnindancdetaseppt oy tamnigine avast
of the number of windows (ny,) that comprised an event and
the conversion factor (w1,2) between the length of the
processed running window data set and the original data set
(con-app = nw * wia)-

to improve event duration measurements, we took the start
and end indices of each event identified by the hm model
and multiplied these time points by w1,2 to obtain the
relative indices where the binding events occurred in the raw
data trace. each event was then subset of the original raw
trace, transformed with a 10-ms (nonsliding) running
variance, and analyzed with a changepoint dete
algorithm (68). reanalyzing each event at the original data
collection frequency permitted for more diverse and accurate
event duration (ton-acc) measures, which were calculated by
ifferencing the changepoint identified start (cpstart) and end
(pena) indices of each event (ton-ace = pend ~ cpstart) if the
changepoint analysis failed to find an optimal start or end of
an event, then the ton-app value was used for the event
duration measurement.

 

n

 

an event, then the fon-app value was used for the event
duration measurement.

ensemble averaging of single-molecule events was
performed with a similar procedure as described previously
by others (21, 33, 69) with slight modifications to
accommodate for differences in data collection techniques.
the ensemble averaged events are 60 ms long and only
include events that had positive displacements. events
meeting the inclusion criteria had the back 30% of their
lengths removed in preparation for event alignment. the
changepoint analysis provided a new relative time index for
the start of each event, and as a result the events could
universally be reindexed with the same relative time scale.
the first data point in each event was indexed as dpo, and
thus each event was indexed as {dpo, dp1,..-. dpn}c, where dpp
represents either the 300th data point (dp299) in the event
(corresponding to the first go ms of a longer event) or the last
data point of a shorter event (dp.299). for short events less
than 60 ms in which dp, < dpz99, the average displacement of
the event was used to extend the event by dp209 - dpn data
data point of a shorter event (dp.299). for short events less
than 60 ms in which dp, < dpz99, the average displacement of
the event was used to extend the event by dp209 - dpn data
points to make all events equal lengths. events were then
aligned horizontally at dpo, and all matching dp, values were
averaged together to create the final ensemble. the average
ensembles were then fit with a negative mono-exponential
equation using the dre and aomisc r packages to provide
estimates of the rate of the working stroke and plot with the
ggplot2 and cowplot r packages. additional programming
tools used for building the analysis programs include the
gtools, pracma, and tidyverse packages.
steady-state atpase activity

we examined steady-state actin-activated atpase activity
using the nadh coupled assay (18, 22, 29). the maximum
rate of atpase rate (kcat) and actin concentration at half-
maximal atpase (karpase) was determined from the
hyperbolic fits of the atpase activity as a function of actin.
the basal atpase activity (v) was determined in the absence
of actin. the average of at least three separate protein
hyperbolic fits of the atpase activity as a function of actin.
the basal atpase activity (v) was determined in the absence
of actin. the average of at least three separate protein
preparations was used to compare conditions. an unpaired
student's f test was used to determine significant differences
between wt and s217a.
protein construction, expression, and purification

we used the same chicken myosin v construct that was used
for our previous studies, containing the first 1q domain
(residues 1-792), n-terminal tetracysteine motif, and c-
terminal myc and flag tags (5, 18, 22, 29). we introduced the
$217a point mutation into this construct using quikchange
site-directed mutagenesis (stratagene). all constructs were
coexpressed with calmodulin (cam) in the baculovirus
system and purified by flag affinity chromatography.
labeling with fiash and exchange of qsy-cam was
performed as previously described (18, 22). actin was
purified from rabbit skeletal muscle (62) obtained from pell-
freeze and labeled with pyrene when necessary (63). we
performed all experiments in kmg50 buffer (10 mu
imidazole-hcl, 50 mu kcl, 1 mm egta, 1 mv mgcl, and 1 mu
dtt) at ph 7.0 and 25 °c. we replaced dtt with tcep in all
experiments involving fiash labeling. the expression and

conclusions

the current study utilized fret and optical trapping to
provide clear evidence that actin-dependent conformational
changes in the active site are required to trigger the power
stroke and force generation in myosin v. our results are
consistent with models in which the mechanical step (power
stroke and strong actin binding) occurs first, which is
followed by a highly irreversible chemical step (p; release) to
thermodynamically drive the reaction forward (18, 19).
variability in the degree of coupling between the actin- and
nucleotide-binding regions could explain important
ifferences in the rate of attachment to actin observed in low
and high duty ratio myosins. we have identified the switch i
region as an important element of the active site that couples
the actin- and nucleotide-binding regions during the initial
phases of force generation. other details about how actin

conservation and variation in the myosin force-
generating mechanism

myosins have very different rates of atpase cycling and force
generation, which allows them to perform specific biological
beuelauy wic ual

myosins have very different rates of atpase cycling and force
generation, which allows them to perform specific biological
functions. what steps in the proposed model are likely
important for kinetically tuning myosins for their functional
role in the cells? myosin v is a processive myosin that can
function as a single molecule to transport cargo along actin
by spending a large fraction of its atpase cycle bound to actin
and allowing it to walk in a hand-over-hand manner (51, 52).
in contrast, muscle myosins function as an ensemble and only
interact with actin for a small fraction of their atpase cycle
(53). therefore, the overall rate of weak-to-strong transition
is crucial for controlling the rate of entry into the force-
bearing states. myosin v has a higher affinity for actin than
myosin il in the weak-binding states, suggesting that it has a
faster rate of association and thus can more rapidly find its
next binding site on actin (54). it is possible that myosin v is
tuned to rapidly transition from the weak-binding to the
force-bearing state, which involves enhanced coupling
between the active site and actin-binding regions. indeed,
loop 2 in the actin-binding region was found to be involved in

 

 

ini

 

initial force-bearing state, which involves enhanced coupling
between the active site and actin-binding regions. indeed,
loop 2 in the actin-binding region was found to be involved in
enhancing the affinity of myosin v for actin in the weak-
inding states (39, 55), and myosin v has several additional
positively charges residues in this loop that are known to
enhance overall weak-binding affinity (38). another
important charged loop in the actin-binding interface, called
the activation loop, was found to be important for actin
activation of atpase activity (56). therefore, surface loops in
the actin-binding region, which tend to vary greatly between
myosin isoforms (57), likely play a crucial role in allosterically
coupling actin binding with structural changes in the active
site. in addition, actin-regulatory proteins such as troponin-
tropomyosin may also be involved in coupling the actin- and
nucleotide-binding regions that are important for mediating
activation of the power stroke. indeed, the rate of attachment
to actin and phosphate release were demonstrated to be
altered by the presence of troponinjtropomyosin in skeletal
muscle (58, 59, 60).

 

 
impact of $217a on actin activation of the power
stroke

our results provide evidence that structural changes in the
actin-binding region are coupled to changes in the active site
during the initial events of the force-generating mechanism.
we found that s217a slows actin activation of the power
stroke and p; release in solution, making them essentially
appear to occur with the same rate constant (fig. 3), whereas
the rate of the working stroke in the single-molecule assay is
not dramatically slowed (fig. 6). this suggests that an actin-
dependent conformational change is slowed by $217a.

making this step rate-limiting in terms of triggering the
power stroke and then p; release. indeed our pyrene actin-
nding studies directly demonstrate that $217a slows the
rate of pyrene actin quenching 10-fold. one obvious
possibility is that $217a alters the initial weak interaction
between actin and myosin; however, this seems unlikely
because the mutation is in the active site, and weak binding
is thought to be mediated by electrostatic interactions
between actin and myosin (38, 39). alternatively, s217a may
impact the transition from the weak binding state to the
initial stereospecifically bound force-bearing state with the
cleft open immediately prior to the power stroke. woody et
al. (21) proposed the initial force-bearing pre-power stroke
state based on their ultra-fast optical trapping studies, which
found evidence for an actin-attached state that was
populated prior to the working stroke, strong actin binding,
and p; release (21, 33). we also propose that the initial force-
bearing state is not a structural state capable of releasing

phosphate (e.g. the pir proposed by llinas et al. (17)), because
we demonstrate that p; release only occurs after the power
stroke, which is likely coupled to cleft closure (strong actin
binding), based on the mechanical step and strong-binding
occurring concomitantly in the laser trap assay (fig. 6). in
addition, s217a would not be expected to alter the pir state,
because pir is mostly associated with changes in switch ii
with no major changes in switch i (17), although the s217a
mutation could allosterically alter the conformation of switch
il. however, it is possible that structural changes in switch i
were not observed in the pir crystal structure because actin
inding is required to alter the conformation of switch i.
indeed, there is strong evidence that switch i is crucial for
coupling the actin- and nucleotide-binding regions (40).

 

 

another possible scenario is that s217a slows the power
stroke directly, which would have to occur before p; release
and thus would become rate-limiting. we do not favor this
hypothesis because slowing the power stroke step without
altering actin binding does not agree with the 20-fold
decrease in the actin dependence of the power stroke (fig. 3),
hypothesis because slowing the power stroke step without
altering actin binding does not agree with the 20-fold
decrease in the actin dependence of the power stroke (fig. 3),
the pyrene actin quenching data (fig. 4), and our simulations
(figs. $3 and $42), also, the rate of the working stroke, which
is rapid and similar in wt and $217a in the single-molecule
laser trap assay, is not consistent with a slower power stroke
in $217a (fig. 6). thus, we propose that the $217a mutation
impacts the ability to form the initial force-bearing state,
suggesting that the active site must undergo actin-dependent
structural changes, presumably involving switch i, before this
important initial force-bearing state can form.

 

updated model of force generation in myosin v

the impact of $217a on actin activation of the power stroke
and p; release provides key insight into models that describe
the sequence of events associated with force generation in
myosins (fig. 7). myosin containing the hydrolyzed products
site (m.adpp) forms a weak binding interaction
with actin with the lever arm in the pre-force-generating
stgte and the switchelements in. the actiyesits in closed.
in the active site (m.adp-p,) forms a weak binding interaction
with actin with the lever arm in the pre-force-generating
state and the switch elements in the active si
conformations. strengthening of the actin-binding interface
to form the initial force-bearing state requires structural
changes in the active site. the formation of the initial force-
bearing state is followed by lever arm rotation and actin-
binding cleft closure, which are tightly coupled, and then p;
release occurs from a closed cleft conformation. our results
do not distinguish whether p; release occurs through the back
door (opening of switch il) (4, 17) or through the trap door
(opening of switch 1) (41, 42). it is possible that the p; enters
the phosphate tunnel shortly after formation of the initial
force-bearing state and that p; is released after the power
stroke and cleft closure, as suggested in recent models (4, 43).
however, our data would put constraints on the lifetime of
such a state with p; in the phosphate tunnel (~5 ms), based
on p; entering the tunnel before the power stroke and leaving
at the observed 200 s™ rate constant. an excellent test of this
model would be to trap p; in the tunnel with mutations that

at the observed 200 s™ rate constant. an excellent test of this
model would be to trap p; in the tunnel with mutations that
do not disrupt entry into the tunnel but prevent its release
after the power stroke. woody et al. (21) demonstrated that p;
rebinding in the presence of load can reverse the working
stroke, providing strong evidence for the power stroke
occurring before phosphate release. therefore, we favor a
model in which the lever arm rotation associated with the
power stroke occurs rapidly with p, still in the active site (or
in the tunnel), followed by the release of p; from an
intermediate-power stroke and closed actin-binding cleft
conformation.

the slower phase of the power stroke that occurs during the
actomyosin-adp states is also slower in 217a, but because
the earlier steps are slowed (actin-activated power stroke), it
is difficult to evaluate whether it is altered by the mutation
and hence the role of switch i in the process. our simulations

of external loads (e.g. mechanosensitivity).

the proposed model that phosphate release occurs after the
power stroke and cleft closure is in agreement with previous
iochemical and biophysical studies. in myosin v, phosphate
release occurs at an observed rate of ~200 s™', whereas the
rate of the power stroke is clearly faster based on fret
measurements (~400 s“') (18, 22). in addition, the optical
trapping results in the current work and in previous studies
with microsecond time resolution are consistent with a rapid
working stroke, which we assume is driven by rapid lever
arm rotation, and followed by a slower observed phosphate
release (21, 33). most models assume that closure of the
actin-binding cleft occurs concomitantly with the power
stroke because strong attachment to actin would be required
for force production. in support, our previous fret results
demonstrated that the actin-binding cleft closes rapidly
before p; release and pyrene actin quenching (44). however,

demonstrated that the actin-binding cleft closes rapidly
before p; release and pyrene actin quenching (44). however,
we proposed that pyrene quenching does not report the cleft
closure but another slower transition that is sensed by the
actin filament upon strong binding. this hypothesis is
consistent with the slower rate of pyrene actin quenching
(fig. 4) compared with the actin dependence of the power
stroke (fig. 3 and table 1). overall, the current solution

iochemistry, structural, and single-molecule studies are
consistent with the proposed model, but the exact structural
details of the actin-binding interface, active site, and lever
arm will need to be fully delineated.

studies in muscle fibers support a model in which there is a
force-bearing state populated prior to force generation,

which is followed by the power stroke and then p; release
(45). the strongest evidence is from studies that used caged
phosphate to demonstrate that p; rebinding can reverse the
force-generating event in the presence of load, suggesting
that p; release occurs after the power stroke (45, 46). other
pnadels in. which p: rebinding accelerates detachment froma
force-generating event in the presence of load, suggesting
that p; release occurs after the power stroke (45, 46). other
models in which p; rebinding accelerates detachment from a
post-power stroke state have also been proposed to explain
observations in the motility assay (47, 48). additionally, other
muscle fiber studies suggest there is flexibility in terms of
when p; release occurs in relationship to the power stroke,
which would indicate that the power stroke does not gate p,
release (49, 50). however, this model is difficult to reconcile
with the rapid working stroke rates observed in the ultra-fast
optical trapping assay, because a slower p; release before the
power stroke would greatly slow the working stroke (21).
finally, it is important to note that p; release is impacted by
load, as is indicated by optical trapping results (21), and the
model proposed here reflects the unloaded situation.

of the recovery stroke including formation of a collision
complex with atp (step 1a, kx), the movement of the lever

impact of $217a on overall enzymatic, structural,
and mechanical properties

our transient kinetic characterization demonstrates that the
s217a mutation slows the atp hydrolysis and actin-activated
phosphate release rate constants but accelerates the
actomyosin adp release rate constant. the results are
consistent with a previous study of the mutation in mouse
myosin va (26). therefore, the predominant steady-state
intermediates are changed from the actomyosin-adp state in
wt mv to the m.atp and m.adpp, states in $217a,
suggesting that the rates of atp hydrolysis (ky + k4,) and
attachment to actin (k-assoc) are rate-limiting in the mutant.
we also calculated the duty ratio based on the equation
outlined in forgacs et al. (26) and found that the mutant
reduces the duty ratio ~6-fold (0.15 and 0.89, respectively).
our single-molecule optical trapping results suggest that the
saizacaufating. does not alteuthe vastiven item
reduces the duty ratio ~6-fold (0.15 and 0.89, respectively).
our single-molecule optical trapping results suggest that the
217a mutation does not alter the positive unitary
displacements but decreases the attached lifetime (table $3).
the attached lifetime is longer than expected for both wt
and s217a based on the adp release rate constants measured
in solution (table s3), which could be due to the lower
temperature of the optical trapping experiments, the mant
fluorophore altering the adp release rate constants in
solution, and/or the impact of mechanical load in the optical
trap. however, the trend of a 2-fold shorter attached time in
$217a is consistent with the 2-fold faster adp release rate
constant measured in solution. ensemble averaging of the
single-molecule records suggests that the displacement
generated by the working stroke occurred at a rate of at least
600-800 s“! and was only slightly different in wt and s217a
mv (fig. 6). the working stroke rate constants are likely an
underestimate because the measured rate is limited by the
viscous forces acting to slow the velocity of the 1-ym
microsphere moving through solution (32). thus, it is likely
thatkeonskingeuake arcuis aha loc land therelp tic
viscous forces acting to slow the velocity of the 1-ym
microsphere moving through solution (32). thus, it is likely
that the working stroke occurs at >1000 s™! and therefore
would be consistent with the rates of 700-5000 s“ observed
under resistive loads in skeletal (33) and cardiac muscle
myosin (21) using an optical trap with microsecond time
resolution. our results suggests that although the mutation
may have altered actin activation of the power stroke and p;
release, it did not dramatically reduce the working stroke rate
constant and had no impact on the size of the unitary
displacements. these findings are also qualitatively
consistent with our time-resolved fret studies, which
demonstrated that 217a and wt mv have similar donor-
acceptor distance and distance distributions in the pre- and
post-power stroke states (fig. 5). in addition, the mole
fractions observed in the pre- and post-power stroke states

are consistent with a model in which the $217a mutant does

coupling of the recovery stroke and atp
hydrolysis

the recovery stroke in myosin is a key step that allows the
energy from atp hydrolysis to be stored in the myosin motor
in a pre-force-generating state. there is strong evidence from
structural and solution biochemical studies for how myosin
transitions from a nucleotide-free (apo state) to the atp-
bound transition state in which the active site is primed for
atp hydrolysis and the lever arm is in a pre-power stroke
conformation (18, 22, 34, 35, 36). atp binding to apo myosin
causes the conserved elements of the active site, switch i,
switch ii, and p-loop to form closed conformations in which
they coordinate binding to the y-phosphate. the movement
of switch ii into the closed conformation is associated with a
shift in the relay helix from a straight to a bent conformation,

 

 

 

they coordinate binding to the y-phosphate. the movement
of switch il into the closed conformation is associated with a
shift in the relay helix from a straight to a bent conformation,
which alters its interactions with the converter domain and
helps position the lever arm in the pre-power stroke position
(34), other studies suggested that there is a second phase of
the recovery stroke that occurs with hydrolysis, but it was not
known whether this second phase is associated with a
further change in the lever arm position or simply local
rearrangements in the active site and/or converter/relay helix
(37). our results demonstrate that $217a allows for even
faster movement of the lever arm into the pre-power stroke
conformation, whereas the active site is slower to hydrolyze
atp. the work of forgacs et al. (26) demonstrated that the
tryptophan fluorescence signal was nearly identical to the
quench flow results, suggesting that the tryptophan
fluorescence signal reports hydrolysis in $217a (26). our
work is consistent with a model in which atp binding rapidly
transitions myosin into a pre-power stroke conformation,
primarily involving switch ii, which is followed by a
rearrangement of the active site to hydrolyze the y-

 

transitions myosin into a pre-power stroke conformation,
primarily involving switch il, which is followed by a
rearrangement of the active site to hydrolyze the y-
phosphate, involving both switch i and il (fig. 7).
interestingly, it is the second transition associated with
priming the active site for hydrolysis that is sensed by the
tryptophan (fig. s1). thus, s217a causes
these events to become uncoupled and demonstrates that the
transition to the pre-power stroke state is not driven by the
energy from hydrolysis but rather atp binding to switch i,
which has been proposed in previous structural (34) and
kinetic studies (37). interestingly, the atp hydrolysis step
may stabilize the pre-power stroke conformation by
promoting local conformational changes around the relay
helix and converter domain where the nucleotide-sensitive
tryptophan is located. based on forgacs et al. (26), the s217a
mutant slows the hydrolysis step without altering the
equilibrium constant, and our mole fraction results in the
time-resolved fret studies (fig. 5) are in agreement with
these conclusions. overall, our studies of the recovery stroke
highlight that atp binding drives the recovery stroke,
time-resolved fret studies (fig. 5) are in agreement with
these conclusions. overall, our studies of the recovery stroke
highlight that atp binding drives the recovery stroke,
whereas atp hydrolysis may stabilize the pre-power stroke
conformation and control the number of myosins in an
ensemble that are primed to generate force.

discussion

in the current study we used a point mutation (217a) in a
conserved region of the active site of myosins to examine
how myosin coordinates structural changes in the active site
with structural changes in the lever arm region. we found
that the $217a mutation can uncouple the lever arm rotation
during the recovery stroke with the chemical step of atp
hydrolysis, clearly demonstrating that these are two separate
events in the atpase cycle. in addition, we found that the
217a mutation slows actin activation of lever arm rotation
and p; release but does not dramatically slow the rate of the
working stroke in the optical trapping assay. this suggests
that the mutation slows an actin-dependent step that occurs
prior to the power stroke and p; release. we propose that the
actin-dependent step is a transition after the initial
electrostatic weak binding between actin and myosin but
before the transition to the tightly bound closed actin-
binding cleft state that is coupled to lever arm rotation and
force production.

myosin molecule in the presence of 100 yw atp. upon
strongly binding to the actin filament, myosin causes a
reduction in the brownian motion and a displacement driven

because of brownian forces experienced by the bead-actin-
bead assembly when unbound, unitary displacements can be
positive or negative, but the center of the distribution reflects
the average unitary displacement (31). based on several
hundred single-molecule binding events for wt (n = 352) and
s217a (n = 428), we found that the average unitary
displacement was slightly different for the wt and $217a (3 +
0.4 and 5 + 0.4 nm, respectively) (fig. s8). however, the
average lifetime of the binding events was less than half as
long for the s217a versus wt (107 + 17 versus 251 + 39 ms)
(fig. $8), which is relatively consistent with the faster adp
release results in solution (table 1). we also examined the
rate constant of the working stroke in the optical trap (e.g.

values for wt versus s217a (6.9 + 0.1 versus 6.6 + 0.1 nm). we
also did not observe a difference in the frequency of binding

after the power stroke and phosphate release occur, myosin
with adp bound remains tightly bound to actin until adp is,
released and atp-induced dissociation occurs. we examined
the adp release rate constant in acto-mv using mantadp. a
complex of acto-mv (0.5 ym) and mantadp (10 ym) was mixed
with excess atp (1 mm). the mantadp fluorescence decrease
was used to determine the adp release rate constant and was
fit to a single-exponential function. we found that the
mantadp release rate constant (k"+p) was 2-fold faster in
s217a compared with wt (table 1).

we performed kinetic simulations using kintek explorer
software, which allowed us to fit fluorescence transients from
the power stroke and phosphate release experiments to the
kinetic model in scheme 1 (fig. $3). the rate constants used
in the simulations are shown in table s1. we also generated

synthetic data of the power stroke and phosphate release
transients using the kinetic model and fit the synthetic data
to an appropriate exponential function, which allowed us to
create a simulated data set of the power stroke and
phosphate release in wt and s217a (fig. $4). the
synthetically generated data were similar to the experimental
data. we also generated actin-activated atpase curves using
the kinetic model that were similar to our experimental data
(fig. $5). interestingly, the experimental data fit well to a
kinetic model in which $217a does not alter the maximum
rate of the fast power stroke (k‘pwr) or phosphate release (k
pi), demonstrating that the mutation slows actin dependence
of these steps by altering the actin association step (kassoc)-
overall, our kinetic models support the conclusion that the
217a mutant alters several steps in the atpase cycle
including atp-induced dissociation (2-fold), hydrolysis (40-
fold), and adp release (2-fold), which was also demonstrated
in the forgacs et al. study (26). one difference between the
including arp-indudea association (2-101d); nyarolysis (40-
fold), and adp release (2-fold), which was also demonstrated
in the forgacs et al. study (26). one difference between the
two studies is that the maximum rate of phosphate release
was slowed ~10-fold in the work of forgacs et al. (26) (16 s“!
versus 198 s!, respectively) without changing the actin
dependence of p; release, whereas in our study we found the
217a mutation weakened the actin dependence of p; release
(20-fold). the forgacs et al. (26) study was done at lower

ionic strength and temperature, and the affinity of myosin for
actin in the m.adp2 state is known to be ionic strength
dependent (see “discussion”). thus, our current results with
s217a are quite consistent with previous studies and suggest
that the main impact of the mutation is on the hydrolysis and
actin-activated p; release steps.

 

transient time-resolved fret

distribution of structural states within mv, we utilized
transient time-resolved fret (tr?fret, fig. 5). a 5000-hz

distribution of structural states within mv, we utilized
transient time-resolved fret (tr?fret, fig. 5). a 5000-hz
pulsed laser and subnanosecond detection of the resulting
fluorescence transients from mv-f.qsy-cam samples for both
wt and s217a in various biochemical states were acquired
following rapid stopped-flow mixing (fig. s6). the
multiexponential fluorescence waveforms that were acquired
were globally fit to a two-gaussian distance distribution, as
reported in our previous publications (18, 22). the two
distances of this structural model closely match those
predicted from available crystallographic studies, consistent
with our previous studies (table 2) (18, 22). for both the wt
and s217a samples in various biochemical states, the mole
fractions of molecules in either the pre-power stroke or
post-power stroke structural states were allowed to vary. the
fluorescence intensity and lifetime changes from the recovery
stroke experiments (fig. 5a and fig. s7a) are best fit to a mole
fraction change from one distance to the other following the

actin (m(apo)) to mv with hydrolyzed atp bound (m.adpp;).

similarly, the fluorescence intensity and lifetime changes
from the power-stroke experiments (fig. 5a and fig. s7b) are
best fit as a mole fraction change between the two fit
distance distributions from mv with hydrolyzed atp bound
(m.adp;) to mv bound to actin with excess adp present
(am_d). the mole fraction information and the two-gaussian
distance distribution is plotted for both wt and $217a (fig. 5

interprobe distances in either structural state or the mole
fraction of mv molecules occupying these states for any of
the biochemical states acquired. the kinetics of lever arm
rotation determined by trfret demonstrate that $217a
enhances the recovery stroke rate constant (fig. s7a) and
slows actin activation of the power stroke (fig. s78), similar
to the results we observed by stopped-flow fret (figure 2,

were best fit by a single-exponential function, likely because
the experiment was not performed with a sequential mix

resolved intermolecular fret within mv-f:qsy-cam was
acquired with 125-ps resolution following excitation with a
5000-hz pulsed laser. the fluorescence transients for three
biochemical states were best fit globally to a two-gaussian
distance distribution corresponding to the two lever arm
orientations of the myosin motor protein in its pre- and
post-power stroke states (19). a, the mole fraction of the
post-power stroke structural state for each biochemical state
was fit separately for wt (blue) and s217a (red). for the
recovery stroke experiment, the corresponding mole fraction

m(apo) to m.d.p, the mole fraction change between the two

change between lever arm orientations is the change from
m(apo) to m.d.p. the mole fraction change between the two
lever arm orientations for the power-stroke experiment is the

table 2). the peak-center and full-width half-maximum for
each distance distribution are shown (see also table 3).
we examined the phosphate release rate constant using
unlabeled mv constructs and a sequential mix setup identical
to that described above, except that the phosphate-binding
protein was present, which allowed phosphate release to be
measured as a function of actin concentration. the phosphate
release transients were best fit by a single-exponential burst
(p; release) followed by a second slow phase (prehydrolysis
intermediates) (fig. 3d). in wt, the phosphate release rate
constant was hyperbolically dependent on actin
concentration and significantly slower than the fast power
intermediates) (fig. 3d). in wt, the phosphate release rate
constant was hyperbolically dependent on actin
concentration and significantly slower than the fast power
stroke rate constant (22) (fig. 3a and table 1). however, the
rate constant of the phosphate burst was linearly dependent
on actin concentration in s217a (kassoc x k+pi = 0.9 0.1
p7!.s~) and nearly identical to the fast power stroke rate
constant (fig. 3b).

the dramatic decrease in the actin dependence of the power
stroke and phosphate release of $217a prompted us to
directly measure the rate of binding to actin in the m.adpp;
state (fig. 4). we performed a sequential mix experiment in
which myosin was first mixed with atp (10 ym), aged for 20 s
to allow atp binding and hydrolysis, and then mixed with
varying concentrations of pyrene actin (5-10-fold excess over
myosin) and saturating adp (0.5 mm adp, included to prevent
multiple turnovers). the fluorescence transients were fit to a

the power stroke and phosphate release rate constants are

the rate of atp binding and hydrolysis in the absence of actin
was measured by mixing mv 11q with varying concentrations
of atp and monitoring the enhancement in tryptophan
fluorescence (fig. s1). the data were fit to a hyperbolic
function, and the maximum rate of tryptophan fluorescence
change was determined, which is thought to report the atp
hydrolysis rate constant (k.4:+k-1)). the second-order binding
function, and the maximum rate of tryptophan fluorescence
change was determined, which is thought to report the atp
hydrolysis rate constant (k,4:+k-1)). the second-order bi
constant for atp binding to myosin can be obtained by
determining the slope of linear portion of the curve a low atp
concentrations (ky7k+27). we found that $217a reduces the
maximum rate of atp hydrolysis 40-fold while slightly
enhancing the second-order binding constant for atp binding
to myosin (fig. s1 and table 1).

  

 

 

 

atp binding to myosin triggers movement of the lever arm
into the pre-power stroke state (recovery stroke), which is
important for priming myosin for force generation. the rate
of the recovery stroke was examined by monitoring the fret

upon mixing mv-f:qsy-cam with varying concentrations of
atp (fig. 2, ac). the fiash fluorescence increase was best fit

$217a mutation in myosin v

the switch i region of the active site, which shares homology
with other p-loop atpases including kinesin and g-proteins,
consists of a consensus motif (nxxssr) (fig. 1a) (23).
mutating the first serine in this motif was found to reduce
but not abolish actin-activated atpase and in vitro motility in
myosin ii (24, 25). another study examined the impact of
mutating this residue (s217a) in myosin v using steady-state
and transient kinetic analysis as well as single-molecule
(26), but optical trapping and structural kinetics
were not examined. thus, we introduced the $217a point

mutation into a construct of myosin v contained a single 1q
motif (mv), n-terminal tetracysteine tag, and c-terminal myc
and flag tags (18, 22, 27, 28, 29). for experiments utilizing
fret to measure lever arm rotation, we labeled mv with the
tetracysteine-based dye fiash and exchanged qsy-cam onto
the first iq motif (mv-f.qsy-cam) (fig. 1a) (18, 22). the
measurements not involving fret were done with unlabeled
wt and $217 in kmg50 buffer (10 mu imidazole, 50 mm kcl,
1. mm mgcl, 1 mm egta, and 1 mm dtt), whereas the fret
measurements were performed with mv-f.qsy-cam in
kmg50 buffer with 1 mm tcep instead of dtt. in our previous
work we demonstrated that our fluorescence labeling
strategy had a slight impact on steady-state atpase and in
vitro motility (<2-fold) because of a reduction in the adp
release rate constant, whereas other steps in the atpase cycle
were unchanged (18).
results
understanding how motor proteins such as myosin couple
structural changes in their atpase cycle with mechanical
force is a fundamental question in biophysics. indeed, the
actomyosin atpase mechanism is utilized for many different
mechanical tasks in cells including muscle contraction, cell
division, and organelle transport (1). the large family of
myosins, which includes over 20 classes and more than 40
diffecent humanvenes..is.defined by.astructially.conseryed
division, and organelle transport (1). the large family of
myosins, which includes over 20 classes and more than 40
different human genes, is defined by a structurally conserved
motor domain and uses a conserved atpase cycle to convert
chemical energy from atp hydrolysis into mechanical work
(2, 3,4). a detailed understanding of the structural and
functional aspects of the myosin atpase pathway will
enhance our ability to utilize myosins as drug targets to treat
various genetic and pathological diseases (5).

 

the lever arm hypothesis suggests that myosins generate
force by coupling specific conformational changes in the
active site to large conformational changes in the actin-

ing and lever arm regions (4, 6, 7, 8). the lever arm
domain consists of a single a-helix that extends from the
motor and binds a variety of calmodulin or calmodulin-like
light chains. when myosin is bound to actin, its cytoskeletal
track, the rotation of the lever arm can produce a power
stroke that drives actin filament sliding or allows myosin to
walk along actin filaments. a key question in the field is how
does actin binding trigger the dramatic acceleration in the

 

stroke that drives actin filament sliding or allows myosin to
walk along actin filaments. a key question in the field is how
does actin binding trigger the dramatic acceleration in the
release of the products of atp hydrolysis, specifically
phosphate release, which can be accelerated over 1000-fold
(9, 10), and how this is coupled to force production (ie. lever
arm rotation when myosin is bound to its track). there have
been many approaches to addressing this question, including
x-ray crystallography (4), solution biochemical analysis (10),
single-molecule mechanical studies (11, 12, 13), and muscle
mechanics studies (14, 15).

 

the challenge is to integrate all of the results in the literature
into a model that describes the sequence of events associated
with actin-binding, lever arm rotation (referred to as the
power stroke), and force generation (referred to as the
working stroke). structural studies have defined two main
conformations of the lever arm, the pre-power stroke state,
in which atp or the products of atp hydrolysis are tightly
bound to the active site, and a post-power stroke state, in
which adp or no nucleotide is bound (16). crystallography

in which aip or the’products of aip hydrolysis ate tightly
bound to the active site, and a post-power stroke state, in
which adp or no nucleotide is bound (16). crystallography
results on myosin vi have provided insight into the
phosphate release mechanism by demonstrating evidence of
the escape route of phosphate through a phosphate tunnel or
back door (17). based on the crystallography studies, as well
as other results in the literature, this group proposed that
myosin binding to actin triggers structural changes in the
active site that allow phosphate to be released through the
back door. they propose that once phosphate is transitioned
from the active site into the tunnel, strong actin binding and
lever arm swing can occur and then finally phosphate leaves
the tunnel into solution (4). therefore, in this model, only
when myosin is tightly bound to its track does it trigger the
movement of the force-generating lever arm and allow the
release of phosphate, a highly irreversible step in the absence
of load. consequently, studies that have directly measured
the lever arm rotation by fret in real time demonstrated that
the power stroke occurs before the release of phosphate is
observed (18, 19, 20). in addition, recent ultra-fast optical

the lever arm rotation by fret in real time demonstrated that
the power stroke occurs before the release of phosphate is
observed (18, 19, 20). in addition, recent ultra-fast optical
trapping studies on myosin ii suggest that the power stroke
and observed working stroke occur rapidly after attachment
to actin, without any delay that might be caused by an
intermediate with phosphate in the tunnel (21). both models
suggest that the power stroke and strong actin binding are
tightly coupled. there are several key questions that remain
to test current models. foremost is defining structural
changes in the active site that are triggered by attachment to
actin and required for the power stroke and phosphate
release. carefully chosen point mutations designed to inhibit
the lever arm rotation or phosphate release could provide a
powerful test of these models. it is also unclear whether all
myosins follow the same sequence of events or whether
there are variations within the myosin family that are
important for tuning myosins for their biological function.

we have developed a method of measuring the rotation of
the lever arm in myosin v in real time using fret, which
involves labeling myosin v containing a single 1q motif with
fiash at its n terminus and exchanging qsy-labeled
calmodulin at the first iq motif (18). we directly measured
lever arm rotation in the recovery and power stroke steps of
the myosin v atpase cycle and found that the power stroke
occurs in two steps: a rapid step that is faster than phosphate
release and a slower step that occurs before adp release (18,
22). in the current paper we use a point mutation in the
conserved switch i region of the active site to demonstrate
the coupling between the actin- and nucleotide-binding
regions during the power stroke and phosphate release steps.
we also characterized the impact of the mutation in single-
molecule mechanics and kinetics in an optical trapping assay.
our results have led to a model suggesting that the transition
from a weak-binding state to an initial force-bearing state
requires structural changes in the active site and that these
actin-induced structural changes are crucial for triggering the

their mechanical and chemical cycles, but the nature and
timing of this coordination remains controversial. we utilized
a ret approach to examine the kinetics of structural changes

in the actin- and nucleotide-binding regions with force
generation. specifically, $217a enhanced the maximum rate
of lever arm priming (recovery stroke) while slowing atp
hydrolysis, demonstrating that it uncouples these two steps.
we determined that the mutation dramatically slows both
actin-induced rotation of the lever arm (power stroke) and
phosphate release (210-fold), whereas our simulations
suggest that the maximum rate of both steps is unchanged by
the mutation. time-resolved fret revealed that the structure
of the pre- and post-power stroke conformations and mole
fractions of these conformations were not altered by the
mutation. optical trapping results demonstrated that s217a
does not dramatically alter unitary displacements or slow the
working stroke rate constant, consistent with the mutation
disrupting an actin-induced conformational change prior to
the power stroke. we propose that communication between

before producing a power stroke. variability in this coupling
is likely crucial for mediating motor-based functions such as
muscle contraction and intracellular transport.
