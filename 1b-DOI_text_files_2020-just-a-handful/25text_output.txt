abstract

the rodent medial prefrontal cortex (mpfc) plays a key role in regulating cognition, emotion, and behavior. mpfc neurons are activated in

experimental paradigms, raising the questions of whether there are specific task elements or dimensions encoded by mpfc neurons, and whi
encoded parameters are selective to neurons in particular mpfc subregions or networks. here, we consider the role of mpfc neurons in pro
and aversive cues, outcomes, and related behaviors. mpfc neurons are strongly activated in tasks probing value and outcome-associated act
responses vary across experimental paradigms. can we identify specific categories of responses (e.g., positive or negative value), or do mpf
response properties that are too heterogeneous/complex to cluster into distinct conceptual groups? based on a review of relevant studies, we
been done and what needs to be further explored in order to address these questions.

rodent medial prefrontal cortex

the prefrontal cortex (pfc) plays important roles in cognition, motivation, and behavior control (cassaday, nelson, & pezze, 2014; dalley,
robbins, 2004; euston, gruber, & mcnaughton, 2012; miller & cohen, 2001). however, the specifics and extent of what is being encoded i

medial prefrontal neuronal representations of value and motivation

here, we consider mpfc neural correlates of positive and negative value and how these signals interact with motivated action. there is clea
between mpfc neural function and outcome value as shown by the studies described below. representations of outcomes, cues predicting 0
actions needed to approach or avoid outcomes, are fundamental to almost all behaviors associated with mpfc function. underlying cognitio
the need for a motivated action.

negative value: punishment, fear, and aversion

early studies of rodent mpfc neural activity described correlates of aversive learning (peterson, 1986), supporting even earlier studies of ca
mpfc, e.g., (gabriel & orona, 1982). there has since been significant interest in mpfc activity related to learning and behaviors associated

the mpec has also been well-characterized as a key brain region in signaling appetitive value and regulating appetitively-motivated behavic

most studies characterize either appetitive or aversive signaling by mpfc neurons in isolation, raising the question of whether mpfc neurot
