extant research (masked for review) suggests that legacy motives
can be separated into two distinct categories: impact and
reputation legacy motives. impact motives suggest that individuals
are motivated to leave a legacy because they want to positively
impact others. reputation motives suggest that individuals are
motivated to leave a legacy by maintain a good reputation from
future generations. impact legacy motives have been associated
with greater intergenerational concern and were thus expected to be
a predictor of prosociality during the pandemic.

4.2. implications

how individuals choose to respond to the covid-19
pandemic will play a major role in determining the ultimate
impacts and duration of the virus on society. small individual
actions such as wearing a mask, employing self-quarantine
and practicing social distancing could go a long way in
helping contain the number of covid-19 cases. therefore, it
is critical that social scientists learn as much as possible
about factors that both inhibit and promote cooperation and
coordination in response to this massive, novel collective
about factors that both inhibit and promote cooperation and
coordination in response to this massive, novel collective
action problem. we identify previously unstudied factors that
play an important role in promoting adherence to public
health best-practices and prosocial responses to covid-19,
namely, gratitude, fairness and legacy motives. thus, the
current evidence supports existing theoretical models of
intergenerational beneficence, which speculate that
beneficence from previous generations as well as norms of
reciprocity are predictors of intergenerational concern (e.g.,
wade-benzoni & tost, 2009, fig. 1). it also extends such work,
by showcasing that a disposition towards feeling grateful and
valuing fairness also promote specific forms of beneficence,
through the pathway of impact-based legacy motives. by
doing so, this work suggests that pandemic-specific public
health communication and behavioral intervention efforts
should incorporate moral language that can help activate
these strong, pre-existing motivators of prosocial behavior.
from a theoretical perspective, the current investigation also
serves as a reminder of the potential for personal legacies to

from a theoretical perspective, the current investigation also
serves as a reminder of the potential for personal legacies to
act as powerful motivators for acts of beneficence. future
research should investigate how impact-based legacy motives
can be increased and made more salient at the point of
covid-19 related decision-making given that they are appear
to be relatively stable correlates of prosocial behavior and
constructive emotional reactions to the pandemic.

 
4.1. limitations

our study was not without limitations. our sample for t2 was
smaller than the sample that we expected to have based on
our a-priori power analysis (sample based on power analysis:
n=191; sample at t2: n=135). perhaps in no analysis was this
evident than the power that our path analysis had. however,
even with an underpowered sample our hypotheses and our
conceptual model were partially confirmed. nevertheless,
these findings could benefit from replication efforts with a
even with an underpowered sample our hypotheses and our
conceptual model were partially confirmed. nevertheless,
these findings could benefit from replication efforts with a
larger sample size. the findings at hand could also be
extended to include other measures of prosociality that are
not relevant to covid-19, but instead focus on personal
relationships. further, our sample was primarily white
american, failing to capture the racial and ethnic diversity of
the united states. given the fact that covid-19 has
isproportionally impacted people of color (e.g., the
percentage of blacks who were infected by or died due to
covid-19 is disproportionately higher than their actual
population; millett et al., 2020), the associations observed in
the current investigation could be stronger for individuals
who are more impacted by covid-19. finally, another
potential avenue worth considering is the use of gratitude or
fairness primes to increase legacy motivations (or a direct
experimental manipulation of legacy motives), with the aim
of establishing a causal relationship between legacy motives
and prosocial intentions during a time of high uncertainty.
outside the scope of covid-19, legacy motives appear to be
of establishing a causal relationship between legacy motives
and prosocial intentions during a time of high uncertainty.
outside the scope of covid-19, legacy motives appear to be
associated with greater intergenerational concern both to
near and distant future others. exploring the intersection of
future self-continuity, legacy motives, and how this
intergenerational prosociality could be extended in other
fields (e.g., political participation) could be crucial in dealing
with issues that require active civil participation.

 

 
4. discussion

the current investigation supports the hypothesis that
stronger endorsement of fairness as a core value and higher
levels of dispositional gratitude both positively relate to
prosocial reactions and behavioral intentions during the
covid-19 pandemic. the association between gratitude and
fairness on the one hand and covid-19 responses on the
other operates through individual differences in legacy
motives, particularly those focused on having a lasting,
positive impact on the lives of others and not those that are
‘furer operates trots mannmaarantérerices mi 1egacy ———
motives, particularly those focused on having a lasting,
positive impact on the lives of others and not those that are
focused how one will be remembered by future others. in a
setting such as the covid-19 pandemic, where individuals
avoid social interactions with others at the fear of contracting
the virus, we defined prosociality in our study in several
alternative ways: (1) preferences for prioritizing saving
people's lives over the economy during the covid-19
pandemic; (2) consumption of information relevant to
covid-19; (3) adherence to public health recommendations
to prevent the spread of the pandemic. this final measure
usually comes at the expense of the individual, as social
isolation and loneliness could be increased by staying at
home and quarantining.

 

 

 

although these effects were significant as individual
outcomes, and after controlling for an individual's political
ideology (see table 3, table 4, and figs. $1-$3 in the
supplementary materials), when testing all outcomes
concurrently (except for the measure of support for

 

supplementary materials), when testing all outcomes
concurrently (except for the measure of support for
prioritizing saving lives), only the association between
impact legacy motives and adherence to covid-19 health
recommendations remained significant. our measure of
adherence to health recommendations aimed at reducing the
spread of covid-19 (e.g,, items included among others:
avoiding contact with others, washing one’s hands, covering
one’s mouth when being outside/wearing a facemask)
captures self-reported behavior. these results provided the
most extensive support for our conceptual model and
highlight that personal legacy motivation, when guided by an
intention to positively impact other people's lives, is
potentially an avenue to increased behavioral intentions to
help prevent the spread of the pandemic. those who more
highly value fairness and those who experience gratitude to a
greater degree in their lives tend to be more predisposed to
think about their legacy as a means to positively impact
others, and subsequently are more likely to act in a way that
can help contain the spread of the pandemic (i.e. adhere to
health recommendations),
others, and subsequently are more likely to act in a way that
can help contain the spread of the pandemic (i.e. adhere to
health recommendations).

those who were more favorably dispositioned towards
fairness and gratitude were also more likely to feel better
emotionally during the pandemic. this effect was again
mediated by impact-based and not reputation-based legacy
motives. one explanation as to why this phenomenon occurs
may be that those who care about fairness and who feel more
gratitude, and who are therefore more likely to be motivated
to leave a positive impact on the lives of others, consequently
see the pandemic as an opportunity to help others, which in
turn in leads to an increase in their levels of calmness and
optimism (i.e. positive emotions). our measure of positive
emotions was comprised by feelings of optimism and
calmness, both of which constitute constructive responses to
a stressor that is characterized with uncertainty (i.e. the
covid-19 pandemic). maintaining higher levels of optimism
and calmness could potentially help regulate the negative
impacts that covid-18 might have on
covid-19 pandemic). maintaining higher levels of optimism
and calmness could potentially help regulate the negative
impacts that covid-18 might have on individuals’ mental
health and personal relationships.

 

duals’ mental

 

our proposed conceptual model of the linkages between
gratitude, fairness, legacy motives and prosocial covid-19
responses was partially validated. thus we conclude that
gratitude, and fairness to a lesser degree, seem to generate
beneficence in the present and near future, even when the
future is characterized by high levels of uncertainty.

to conduct the most stringent test of our proposed mediation
model, we estimated a path model. in this model, we
accounted for the effect of political conservatism on the
outcome variable by inserting it as a predictor to all covid-19
outcomes. this models had fairness and gratitude at t1 as
exogenous variables, ilm and rlm at t15 as mediating
pathways, and the following variables as outcomes: (1)
positive and negative emotional reactions in response to
covid-19 (i.e. emotional responses); (2) accessing relevant
information to covid-19 and adhering to health
recommendation for covid-19 (i.e. personal behaviors to
reduce the spread of covid-19).° to evaluate our model we
primarily used a chi square test, since our sample was
relatively small (n= 135); in such cases, researchers have
suggested it as the most appropriate test (e.g., barrett, 2007).
however, we also report the fit indexes that are commonly
used to indicate acceptable fit (i.e. cfi>0.90, rmsea<0.10,
srmr<0.08; e.g., kenny, 2020; kline, 2011).

given our small sample size, we computed a power analysis
to get a better understanding of our sample's capacity to
detect an effect. we used the online rmsea power calculator
(quantpsy.org) operated by preacher and coffman (2006).
our n was set to 132, with an alpha set to 0.05, a null rmsea
set to 0.00, and an alternative rmsea set to 0.08. the
resulting power was 0.45 which suggested that our sample
was not adequately powered for this analyses and should be
interpreted with caution.

significantly positively correlated with ilm, but not with
rlm. gratitude was significantly correlated with both ilm
and rlm. in turn, rlm was not significantly correlated with
any of the covid-19 outcomes, while ilm was significantly

3.1. statistical analysis

all reported analyses were computed in sas version 9.4. we
first computed correlations within each timepoint, to test
whether in each month, the hypothesized associations would
be observed. then, we computed path models examining the
first computed correlations within each timepoint, to test
whether in each month, the hypothesized associations would
be observed. then, we computed path models examining the
outcomes of the study simultaneously, while controlling for
political ideology.

 

3.2. correlations within timepoints

gratitude was positively correlated within each timepoint
with positive emotions in response to covid-19, adhering to
covid-19 health behaviors and also adhering to potentially
stricter governmental measures (see table 3). trait fairness
was also positively correlated with both adhering to covid-
19 health behaviors and stricter governmental measures in
both timepoints. further, it was also positively associated
with prioritizing saving people over the economy.‘ both types
of legacy motives were correlated positively with all covid-
19 outcomes at both timepoints (except for the prioritization
of saving the economy for ilm in t2).

3.3. correlations across timepoints

eg

higher fairness and gratitude at t1 was positively correlated
with adhering to health recommendations to prevent the
spreading of covid-19 at t2. further, for gratitude a positive
correlation was observed with positive emotional reactions to
covid-19. both fairness (r=0.23, p=.007) and gratitude
(r=0.46, p<.001) at t1 were positively correlated with ilm,
but only gratitude (r=0.45, p<.001) was correlated with rlm
at t2. both legacy motives remained positively correlated
with positive emotional reactions to covid-19, accessing
information relevant to covid-19, and prioritizing saving
lives during covid-19. only ilm were correlated with
adhering to health recommendations and also with adhering
to potential mandatory governmental measures to help
combat the spread of covid-19 (see table 4). all these
findings remained significant after controlling for political
conservatism.

this novel measure differentiates between legacy motives
that are driven by one's desire to leave a positive impact on
the lives of others (8 items, i.e. impact legacy motives; ilm,

generations as someone with a good reputation (8 items, ie.
reputation legacy motives; rlm, e.g., “i want to be
remembered as someone with a good reputation.”).

   

2.2.4. personal behaviors during covid-19

we generated a measure capturing adherence to suggested
health behaviors pertinent to reducing the spread of covid-
19 (7 items, eg., “i covered my mouth whenever i coughed
and sneezed.”). adherence to health behaviors is perhaps the
most prosocial personal behavior that individuals from all
backgrounds can engage in. since this pandemic has been
characterized by a rapid spread of cases due to the airborne
nature of the virus, we posited that adherence to health
recommendations mandated by the government reflect an

we also constructed a measure of exposure to covid-19
related information to investigate how much information
relevant to the pandemic individuals had consumed (4 items,
e.g. “in the past week how much have you searched for
information relevant to coronavirus online?"). although not
directly reflective of prosociality, staying up to date with the
development of the covid-19 pandemic highlights that
individuals care about the impact of the pandemic. further,
those who are more aware of covid-19 related information
are also those who are more willing to help prevent the
spread of the virus (this claim is supported by the positive
correlations with adherence to health behaviors and stricter
orders by the government in table 3).

(see supplementary materials) suggested that two factors,
positive (comprised by optimism and calmness) and negative
(comprised by fear, anger, sadness and anxiety) emotional
responses to covid-19, should be retained. these measures
focused more on individual responses to the pandemic rather
than prosociality. our rationale for including these measures
was that we consider emotional reactions to the pandemic as
influential for decision-making, since emotions can play a key
role in personal health decisions (dupont et al., 2020).

   

 

 

a debate has sparked with regards to whether the
government should strive to save people's lives or the
economy (eg., the new york times, 2020). we measured
people's attitude towards each priority with one item (saving
the people: “we should sacrifice the nation’s economy by
maintaining the quarantine to ensure that as many people as
possible survive.”; saving the economy: “we should be

the people: “we should sacrifice the nation’s economy by
maintaining the quarantine to ensure that as many people as
possible survive.”; saving the economy: “we should be
willing to sacrifice ourselves by stopping the quarantine to
ensure that the nation’s economy does not suffer.”). these
measures captured prosociality (or lack thereof) in a more
externally valid way, as it captured support for the sacr
resources in order to save people's lives.

 

 

   

 

 

in a more exploratory fashion, we were interested in
determining whether fairness and gratitude would be
correlated with accepting stricter and mandatory measures
enforced by the government to deal with the spread of
covid-19 (4 items, e.g, “if the u.s. government enacted
mandatory quarantine for everyone, would you comply with
this decision?”). although in many nations quarantine has
been a mandatory and federally enforced process, in the us
this is not the case. therefore, we considered willingness to
adhere to such potential future orders to be an indication of
personal sacrifice for the greater good of the nation, and
consequently, an indicator of prosociality.

“justice is the most important requirement for a society").

2. methods
2. methods
this conceptual model, which draws on extant research on
intergenerational concern (see wade-benzoni & tost, 2009),
presents a novel framework for understanding the proposed
association between gratitude, fairness and motivations to
leave a lasting legacy as correlates of prosociality. although
these constructs have been discussed alongside one another,
to our knowledge, no empirical research to date has
examined these three factors (gratitude, fairness, legacy
motives) concurrently. further, most studies focusing on
these factors tend to focus on issues high on intertemporal
discounting (e.g., for legacy motives see: hurlstone, price,
wang, leviston, & walker, 2020; for gratitude see: watkins &
goodwin, 2020) or on outright acts of prosociality (e.g.,
counting (eg. tor legacy motives see: hurlstone, ptice
wang, leviston, & walker, 2020; for gratitude see: watkins &
goodwin, 2020) or on outright acts of prosociality (e.g.,
donating to charity; nilsson et al., 2020), rather than issues
that are salient in the present, and for which daily actions
and behaviors are the agents of prosociality through their
direct impacts on others’ well-being. further, most research
on legacy motives has considered the construct to be a
unidimensional one (eg., zaval et al., 2015), rather than one
that can be meaningfully disentangled into two separate
motives, which can differentially impact prosocial intentions.

 

   

1.4. prosociality and the covid-19 pandemic

ina recent paper, bavel, baicker, boggio, et al. (2020)
suggested that the social and behavioral sciences have a large
role to play in combatting the covid-19 pandemic. among
the different research avenues that the social sciences can
address, two are directly relevant to the purpose of the
current investigation: moral decision making and

cooperation within groups. moral decision making, bavel and
colleagues argue, is crucial a uals will have to act
current investigation: moral decision making and

cooperation within groups. moral decision making, bavel and
colleagues argue, is crucial as individuals will have to act
selflessly and sacrifice personal resources (e.g., spend more
time isolated, engage in less social interactions with others).
at the same time, widespread cooperation (e.g., with
mandated restrictions) will be essential to keeping the virus
contained over time. both moral decision making (e.g., turiel,
2015) and cooperation (e.g,, simpson & willer, 2015) fall
under the umbrella of prosociality. therefore, by better
understanding the individual differences that promote
prosocial decision making in the context of the pandemic,
researchers and public health officials stand much to gain
with respect to identifying potential leverage points for
promoting greater adherence to necessary ameliorative
practices. at the same time, studying these factors in the
context of a real-world, quickly evolving collective action
problem provides a novel opportunity for further developing
theoretical and empirical models of prosociality under
conditions of uncertainty.

  

 

theoretical and empirical models of prosociality under
conditions of uncertainty.

1.5. the current study

we sought to test our hypothesis that individual differences
in fairness and gratitude would be related to greater prosocial
intentions during the covid-19 pandemic. we predicted that
this effect would be mediated by personal legacy motivations
in a cross-sectional study. we hypothesized that although
both forms of legacy motives (i.e. impact- and reputation-
based motives) might initially relate to greater prosociality
during the covid-19 pandemic, when controlling for their
shared variance, only impact legacy motives would be
associated with more prosocial responses relevant to the
pandemic.! to test our aforementioned hypothesis in a
rigorous design, one that accounts for the uncertainty that
covid-19 generates, we conducted a one-month longitudinal
study. this design allowed us to test our hypotheses at two
separate points in time, and across time, thus allowing us to
make an argument about directionality in our hypothesis. it

also allowed us to explore for possible changes over time.

in the united states, the covid-19 pandemic has quickly
become politically polarized, with ideological conservatives
reporting significantly lower risk perceptions as well as
weaker adherence to mandated and voluntary public health
behaviors (e.g., wearing masks; conway iii, woodard, zubrod,
& chan, 2020). thus, to ensure that our findings are
generalizable, we also included political conservatism as a
covariate in our proposed analyses. ultimately, better
understanding the linkages between gratitude, fairness, and
personal legacy motivation is important both for theory
development as well as for efforts aimed at leveraging these
mechanisms to promote prosocial behavior in response to the
pandemic.

 

 

 
1.2. fairness and prosociality

fairness is a moral foundation which pertains to altruism and
reciprocity (haidt & joseph, 2008). researchers have found
that people who more strongly endorse fairness as a core
moral value are also more dispositionally positive towards
unfortunate others (low & wui, 2015). studies have shown
that even people who are more individualistic in their
personality care about equality and fairness and will forego
personal gain to achieve these goals (van den bergh, dewitte,
& de cremer, 2006). in fact, researchers have found robust

personal gain to achieve these goals (van den bergh, dewitte,
& de cremer, 2006). in fact, researchers have found robust
associations between fairness and unbiased allocation of
resources, as well as charitable giving (nilsson, erlandsson, &
vastfjall, 2020). other recent studies have also highlighted
that fairness is positively correlated with how acceptable it is
to engage in self-sacrificial actions (crone & laham, 2015).
thus, we would expect that greater endorsement of the
moral value of fairness would be positively correlated with
greater prosociality in the face of the pandemic. those who
endorse fairness, and are thus concerned with justice,
reciprocity and altruism (e.g., abbate & ruggieri, 2011),
should be more likely to both prioritize saving people even at
significant economic cost and to adhere to public health
recommendations so as to help others. despite previous
research linking fairness with prosociality (e.g., haidt &
joseph, 2008), it is noteworthy to consider that the covid-19
pandemic is a unique case in some ways. prosociality in this
context is defined more by actions that are self-focused (e.g.,
social distancing, wearing a mask, adhering to government

context is defined more by actions that are self-focused (e.g.,
social distancing, wearing a mask, adhering to government
guidelines, staying informed with the recent developments of
covid-19) as opposed to what might traditionally be thought
of as other-focused actions (e.g., providing aid and care to
people in need). therefore, the current investigation extends
past research on fairness and prosociality by explicitly
examining whether the well-established link between the
two concepts extends to less traditional (i.e., more self-
focused) forms of prosocial behavior.

 

 

1.3. personal legacy motives: linking gratitude,
fairness and prosocial behavior under conditions
of increased mortality salience

the covid-19 pandemic has imposed significant economic,
social and physical costs on people around the world; the
psychological impacts have also been immense (zaidi & ali,
2020). these impacts are the result of the very real fact that
the pandemic has increased the chances of dying for large
swaths of the population (cdc, 2020), asa result, the
2020). these impacts are the result of the very real fact that
the pandemic has increased the chances of dying for large
swaths of the population (cdc, 2020). as a result, the
pandemic has likely increased many people's sense of
mortality in a way that may have widespread yet
heterogeneous effects on how they engage with the issue. for
example, research highlights that when faced with credible
threats to one’s own survival, some people react by
denigrating messengers and denying the threat whereas
others become more focused on living a good life with the
time they have remaining (zaleskiewicz, gasiorowska, &
kesebir, 2013).

  

  

researchers have found that one way in which individuals
engage productively with their own mortality is to think
about the positive legacies they can leave behind (wade-
benzoni, 2019). broadly, legacies are defined as “an enduring
meaning attached to one’s identity” (wade-benzoni & tost,
2009, pp. 183). a legacy motive, therefore, is the motivation
to build a legacy that will last the test of time. research has
shown that so-called “legacy motives” may be a particularly
to build a legacy that will last the test of time. research has
shown that so-called “legacy motives” may be a particularly
powerful motivator of prosocial behavior, particularly when
individuals are making decisions with long-lasting effects on
future others (wade-benzoni & tost, 2009). extant research
has highlighted that being concerned about one's legacy
predicts increased prosocial intergenerational decision
making across different fields, such as the environment
(zaval, markowitz, & weber, 2015) and in social dilemmas
(wade-benzoni & tost, 2009). it is important to note,
however, that most extant work on legacy motives tends to
be either very theoretical, as most social
focus on theoretical allocation of resources to a future agent
(eg., wade-benzoni & tost, 2009), or within a very specific
sphere, such as the domain of intergenerational
environmental concern. we posit that the uncertainty and
mortality salience the covid-19 pandemic has generated

about what one should/should not do) can go a long way in

building on this past work, we posit that legacy motives—
particularly those focused on the impacts our actions have on
others (as opposed to more self-oriented reputational
concerns)—may play an important yet previously
underappreciated role in motivating prosocial behavior in the
context of the covid-19 pandemic. when faced with a
potential threat to their own survival as well as the survival
of the people around them (including family, friends and
neighbors), individuals who are relatively higher in legacy
motives should, all else being equal, be more likely to engage
in behaviors that could help build their positive legacies (in
case they do in fact become a victim of the virus).

individual differences in the salience of legacy motives seem

dispositional fairness and gratitude on the one hand and

poised to help explain the proposed linkages between
dispositional fairness and gratitude on the one hand and
whether people make socially optimal decisions in response
to the pandemic on the other. research has revealed that
those who emphasize fairness as a core moral value are more
likely to be concerned with altruism and reciprocity (e.g.,
abbate & ruggieri, 2011) and other work shows that people
who have engaged in reciprocal exchange express more
dispositional gratitude (e.g,, barnett et al., 2019). further,
theoretical claims in the field of intergenerational reciprocity
consider beneficence by previous generations to be a factor
that promotes legacy motives (see wade-benzoni & tost,
2009). in line with these claims, we consider legacy motives
to be an individual difference that is affected by two key
factors: how dispositionally grateful people are in their lives
and how much they value fairness. when presented with
evidence that previous generations have acted in a manner
that benefited them, individuals tend to perceive a greater
obligation to help future others (graham et al., 2011; kertzer,
powers, rathbun, & iyer, 2014). moreover, fairness is an

prosociality, and therefore, we hypothesized that scoring
higher in fairness would be associated with greater legacy
motives, particularly ones that are concerned with having a
positive impact on the lives of others.

consequently, we theorize that those who are dispositionally
more grateful as well as those who place a greater emphasis
on the role of fairness as a moral value will be more
concerned about the impact they have on others, which we
operationalize as their motivation to leave a positive legacy.
personal legacies become even more relevant when threat
and mortality becomes highly salient, as is the case during
the covid-19 pandemic. this theoretical argument is
presented as a conceptual model in fig. 1.

1. introduction

towards the end of 2019 and throughout 2020, a new
coronavirus (sars-cov-2) quickly spread across the globe,
leading to a pandemic that upended nearly every facet of
daily life for billions of people. as of october 2020 the covid-
19 pandemic has infected tens of millions of people and
killed more than 1,000,000 people (johns hopkins university,
2020), and it has generated unprecedented uncertainty in the
global economy by increasing unemployment across the
globe (wagner, 2020) and destabilizing the global order.

beyond immediate and direct health impacts, the pandemic
has also led to soaring levels of stress, anxiety and loneliness
among many individuals (zaidi & ali, 2020). delayed and
inconsistent political responses to the crisis in many
countries have highlighted the critical role that individuals
have to play in combating the virus and, more broadly, in
contributing to public goods such as
ighted the ci
have to play in combating the virus and, more broadly, in
contributing to public goods such as public health and
sustainable ecosystems. moreover, weak government
responses have occurred regardless of nations’ wealth,
leadership quality and form of government (for a
commentary see chater, 2020).

    

various factors influence prosocial decision-making in the
face of collective action problems, including informational
and situational uncertainty, social norms, risk perceptions,
and the costs (real or imagined) of personal action (ostrom &
walker, 2003). one feature of the current public health crisis
that is particularly important in shaping how individuals
respond is the direct threat of personal harm and death, the
covid-19 pandemic not only acts to increase many people's
personal health- and mortality-related risk perceptions, but it
may also activate a slew of psychological mechanisms
(productive or counter-productive) that are perhaps less
obvious drivers of action in response to threat. in the current,
investigation, we examine the relative effect of two such

obvious drivers of action in response to threat. in the current,
investigation, we examine the relative effect of two such
factors as they relate to various behavioral, affective and
attitudinal responses to the pandemic: fairness and gratitude.
ince the pandemic is likely to increase mortality salience, we
sought to further the extant research by also examining
whether the effects of fairness and gratitude on covid-19
responses might be mediated by a previously identified
mechanism involved in promoting prosocial, and especially
intergenerational, decision-making (i.e. making decisions for
the sake of future generations), namely, personal legacy
motives (often defined as wanting to leave a lasting legacy
after one has passed). we draw upon extant research to
explore how fairness, gratitude and legacy motives might
drive prosociality during the covid-19 pandemic.

 

1.1. gratitude and prosociality

gratitude (in its trait form) is often described as
“appreciation felt after one has been the beneficiary of an

tic act” (emmons & crumpler, 2000, pp. 56-57). past
gratitude (in its trait form) is often described as
“appreciation felt after one has been the beneficiary of an
altruistic act” (emmons & crumpler, 2000, pp. 56-57). past
research shows that higher levels of dispositional gratitude
predict better personal well-being (e.g., satisfaction with life,
vitality, subjective happiness, optimism and hope) and
decreased emphasis on materialistic attitudes (mccullough,
emmons, & tsang, 2002). scholars have also shown that
gratitude motivates prosocial behavior in multiple ways.
emotions such as gratitude evolved as a mechanism to help
promote cooperation and group coordination (stellar et al.,
2017), recent studies have found that perceiving past
generations as prosocial motivates prosociality towards
others and future generations (barnett, van vleet, & cantu,
2019), studies have also shown that gratitude often acts in an
altruistic manner, promoting prosocial helping behaviors
even when it comes with costs to the actor (bartlett &
desteno, 2006). increased gratitude, both as a disposition
(ie., trait) and as a transient, experienced emotion (ice, state),
predicts greater prosociality (ma, tunney, & ferguson, 2017).
what is perhaps less known is whether gratitude can act as a
(ie, trait) and as a transient, experienced emotion (i, state),
predicts greater prosociality (ma, tunney, & ferguson, 2017).
what is perhaps less known is whether gratitude can act as a
force for prosociality during times of high uncertainty, such
as the conditions brought forward by the covid-19
pandemic. based on extant findings, we investigated whether
gratitude would be positively associated with different
prosocial tendencies within the context of the covid-19
pandemic.

abstract

the covid-19 pandemic has produced an unprecedented
collective action problem. individuals must make a variety of
decisions that influence both their own well-being and the
health of those around them. achieving the collective best-
interest depends on most individuals responding in socially
optimal ways, which includes remaining familiar with the
current status of the pandemic, adhering to health guidelines
relevant to the pandemic, and having a constructive
emotional response to the pandemic. we sought to examine
how individual differences in core moral motivators of
collective action (i.e., fairness and gratitude) relate to
individuals’ covid-19 responses. in a two-wave study (t1:
n=254; t2: n=135) conducted in may and june 2020, we find
that individual differences in fairness and gratitude were
associated with more adaptive (i.e. positive emotions) and

 

     

that individual differences in fairness and gratitude were
associated with more adaptive (i.e. positive emotions) and
prosocial (i.e. remaining familiar with the pandemic,
adhering to public health guidelines, prioritizing saving lives)
responses to the pandemic. these effects are mediated
through differences in impact legacy motives (i.e. being
concerned about the impact one leaves behind once they
have passed). understanding the links between gratitude,
fairness and legacy motives, and their impact on prosociality,
could promote both current and intergenerational prosocial
decision making.
