5. conclusions

this exploratory study investigated the impact of parity on
gait mechanics in a healthy population within 1-5 years of
giving birth. the identified kinetic differences between the
parous and nulliparous women show a potential for a
connection between parity and changes in knee joint

giving birth. the identified kinetic differences between the
parous and nulliparous women show a potential for a
connection between parity and changes in knee joint
mechanics previously implicated in oa risk. however,
additional research controlling for weight gain in pregnancy
and examining changes in cartilage health post-partum are
needed to see if parity is a risk factor for oa.
4. discussion

the aim of this study was to quantify the impact of parity on
gait mechanics to better understand how parity may relate t
future oa risk. the impact of parity on kinematics was
smaller than expected, and only the knee flexion angle at toc
off differed between groups, in contrast to our initial
hypothesis. the impact of parity on kinetics was much
smaller than expected, and only the knee flexion angle at toc
off differed between groups, in contrast to our initial
hypothesis. the impact of parity on kinetics was much
greater, and parous women had significantly smaller knee
extension moments at heel strike, first peak knee flexion
moments, and peak hip adduction moments, compared to th
nulliparous group. similar changes in knee mechanics have
also been found following traumatic injury. the post-
traumatic changes in knee mechanics have been linked with
early changes in cartilage health [10,11,30], and thus linked
with oa initiation. the results of this study suggest there is a
long lasting biomechanical impact of parity, and future
investigation should consider parity and joint biomechanics
when probing the greater risk of oa in women.

the hypothesis that parity would lead to changes in joint
kinematics was based on prior evidence of a more everted
foot, greater pelvic distensability leading to altered trunk
muscle function, and changes in multiplanar ligament laxity
after pregnancy [20,31,32]. as a result, we expected to find
sroup differences in the hip flexion-extension angles but no
fiffscrnaanctiorg fond siibuis aun ppianthananishfeany
after pregnancy [20,31,32]. as a result, we expected to find
sroup differences in the hip flexion-extension angles but no
differences were found. similarly, we hypothesized that
altered ligament laxity in the knee [20] and persistent
changes in the foot structure [32], if present, would increase
the ankle eversion angles in walking and alter knee
kinematics. again, no differences were found. as we did not
obtain any assessments of ligament or joint laxity, it’s not
possible to know if there were simply no differences in
iigament laxity between groups or if the parous group altere
their muscle activation patterns to compensate for any post-
partum differences in ligament mechanics.

the toe-off knee flexion angle at all speeds was the only
kinematic difference between the parous and nulliparous
groups. the underlying stimulus for the difference in the
knee flexion angle is not clear. the preferred walking speed
and step length were slightly slower and shorter in the
parous group, although not statistically significant. however,
rogether this might contribute to less extension/greater
flexion at toe-off. prior work indicates that there is no impac
parous group, although not statistically significant. however,
rogether this might contribute to less extension/greater
flexion at toe-off. prior work indicates that there is no impac
of an anteriorly added mass on joint kinematics [33],
suggesting this is likely not adaptation to changes in the bod
center of mass during pregnancy or an adaptation to child
carrying post-partum. there is no evidence for changes in of
risk due to altered mechanics at toe-off, likely due to the
relatively small joint loads experience at the knee at this
point in the gait cycle. thus, it's unlikely that the toe off knee
flexion angle difference would impact long-term knee healt

we hypothesized the q-angle would be greater in the parous
group because of the substantial changes in pelvis connectiv
tissue properties during pregnancy and birth [31,34], but this
was not the case. it is difficult to compare q-angle values
across studies, as there is no standard calculation method;
however, the mean values for both groups were smaller than
other comparable studies [35], [36], [37]]. for the q-angle
measurements, all participants were instructed to stand witl
:wo inches between their first metatarsals on each foot. in
other comparable studies [[35], [36], [37]]. for the q-angle
measurements, all participants were instructed to stand witl
:wo inches between their first metatarsals on each foot. in
addition, to reduce error due to variation in the unspecified
quiet standing position, the anatomical coordinate systems
were rotated to be co-incident with the global coordinate
system prior to calculation of the q-angle. the standard
deviation for the parous group was very large, more than 50
arger than that of the nulliparous group. this large variance
in the q-angle for the parous group suggests that the nature
of pregnancy may alter the impact of pregnancy on the lowe
extremity alignment. we noted a large variance for the
amount of weight gained during pregnancy, and some
residual weight gain post-partum for the parous group. the
slightly heavier body mass as compared to pre-pregnancy is
relatively small and not expected to impact the results. to
investigate the possibility that weight gain during pregnancy
may be lead to greater musculoskeletal changes in pregnancy
and post-partum, we divided the parous women into two
groups based on the median self-report weight gain during
pregnancy (median weight gain 13.6kg). there was a

and post-partum, we divided the parous women into two
groups based on the median self-report weight gain during
pregnancy (median weight gain 13.6kg). there was a
moderate effect size for differences in the q-angle (es 0.56)
with a larger angle for the above median group (q-angle: 4.8
sd 3.4 degrees, 90 % ci 3.31-6.29), as compared to the below
the median group (q-angle: 3.3 sd 1.7 degrees, 90 % ci 2.55-
4.05). this suggests that it may be critical to account for
weight gain during pregnancy in future investigations of
post-partum differences in gait biomechanics.

 

for parous women, the knee extension moment at heel strik
was smaller than for nulliparous women. as there were no
kinematic differences between the groups, this suggests
subtle changes in the heel strike transient or orientation of
the ground reaction force vector, alone or together with
changes in limb orientation, may be responsible for this
difference. while a clear link between changes in the knee
extension moment and oa initiation has not be made, it's
worth noting that the knee extension moment is typically
smaller for groups with knee oa, as compared to young
sxvenstomatinindiidu un indication ase cbbataacacs4
worth noting that the knee extension moment is typically
smaller for groups with knee oa, as compared to young
asymptomatic individuals, indicating a role of both age and
disease status on this outcome [38]. the peak knee flexion
moment was also smaller for parous as compared to
nulliparous women. a reduction of the peak knee flexion
moment during gait is commonly reported after acl injury
and reconstruction (37-39). recent work has found that
individuals with acl reconstructions with greater reduction:
in knee flexion and adduction moments(as compared to
contralateral) have early osteoarthritic change in cartilage 5
years post injury [11]. however, the effect size for the
difference was only moderate in the present study, and there
were no significant differences in post-hoc testing. thus,
while prior work in post-traumatic oa has shown that
decreasing joint loading can have negative effects on long-
rerm health of cartilage [10,11], the relevance of the small
differences in the knee flexion moment post-partum should
be addressed in future studies.

be addressed in future studies.

the only difference in frontal plane gait mechanics was a
smaller first peak hip adduction moment for the parous
compared to nulliparous women. given the well documente
changes in the pelvis structure throughout pregnancy, we
hypothesized that the magnitude would be larger for parous
women and not smaller, as was found. given that neither the
q-angle, frontal plane hip kinematics, nor the step width
differed between the two groups, it is likely that alterations
in upper body or center of mass movements (and thus
round reaction force vector) during walking occurred,
contributing to this difference.

first peak hip adduction moment (table 4). at all speeds the
knee extension moment at heel strike was smaller for the
parous group compared to the nulliparous group (preferred:
p= 0.036; fast preferred: p=0.084; set: p=0.039). the group
effect of the peak knee flexion moment (p=0.040) was also
smaller for the parous as compared to nulliparous group;
however, there were no significant differences found within
speeds. there was a significant group effect for the peak hip

visual 3d (c-motion, germantown, md) along with custom
matlab code was used to post-process the marker data and
calculate the rigid body kinematics. the anatomical
coordinate systems were set up as previously defined [24].
the hip joint centers were calculated using the bell et al. [25
regression equations. the point cluster technique (pct) was
used to quantify the motion of the thigh and shank during
che walking trials [26], and the principal axes of the pct
marker clusters on the thigh and shank were calculated for
each frame of the walking trial, assuming a unit weight for
each marker in the cluster. the joint angles were calculated
using a cardan decomposition with a rotation sequence of
flexion, adduction, rotation. kinematic and kinetic data were
filtered using a low pass butterworth filter with cutoff point
using a cardan decomposition with a rotation sequence of
flexion, adduction, rotation. kinematic and kinetic data were
filtered using a low pass butterworth filter with cutoff point
of 8 and 15hz, respectively. a standard inverse dynamics
procedure was implemented in visual 3d to calculate 3d

int kinetics. the default segment inertial parameters [27,25
in visual 3d were used for both groups as there is not
evidence to suggest postpartum differences [12]. joint
moments were normalized to height and weight of the
participant, and all waveforms were interpolated to 101 data
points, representing the length of the gait cycle (0-100%).
timing of heel strike and toe off of the right leg were
determined by a vertical grf threshold of 20n.

a 2-way (speed by group) repeated measures anova was
used to determine if there were differences of parity, across
speeds, and for each variable with a=0.05. a fisher's least
significant difference (lsd) post-hoc test was used to assess
within speed results, and 90 % confidence intervals and
cohen's d effects sizes were calculated for all variables. ages,
heights, weights, speeds, and q-angle were compared using
;wo-sample t-tests. the primary outcomes were peak ankle
eversion, peak hip flexion over stance, heel-strike, and toe-
off, early stance peak knee flexion, mean internal rotation
angle of the knee across stance, and range of motion of the
internal rotation angle across stance. for kinetics, outcome
variables were peak knee adduction, flexion, and internal
rotation moments, and hip adduction and internal rotation
moments during stance.

1. introduction

symptomatic knee osteoarthritis (oa) is a serious condition
that affects nearly 50 % of adults aged 45-85 years [1].
women are twice as likely as men to develop oa [2], and
-ypically have higher losses of function and disability [3,4].
the risk discrepancy for women with oa has been partially
attributed to hormonal changes experienced by women,
including menarche and hormonal contraceptive use [5], an¢
morphological differences between men and women [6].
pregnancy may be an additional risk factor for knee oa in
women [5,7]. older parous women (history of child bearing)
are reported to have lower cartilage volume in the knee, as
compared with older nulliparous (non-child bearing) womer

alterations in joint kinematics [8,9] andjor kinetics [10,11],
that may shift tibiofemoral contact locations and alter the
mechanical stimulus to cartilage, are proposed as key
mechanical factors in the initiation of knee oa.
morphological and gait changes with pregnancy, if present
post-partum, may represent a biomechanical risk factor for
oa in parous women. throughout pregnancy, the center of
mass moves anteriorly and superiorly [12], and women walk
with greater anterior pelvic tilt, greater thoracic extension at
heel strike [13], and a decrease in step-length but increase in
the step-width [14,15]. in addition, there are decreases in
propulsive moments and forces, but these increase in the
immediate post-partum period (0-20 weeks), suggesting
there may be some restoration of normal mechanics post-
partum [16]. to date, there has been limited investigation
into the possibility of persistent biomechanical changes post
; artum that may be relevant for oa risk.

 

into the possibility of persistent biomechanical changes post
partum that may be relevant for oa risk.

there is initial evidence of lasting changes in musculoskeleta
properties post-partum. lower extremity joint laxity
increases throughout pregnancy, and differences in ligament
laxity may persist post-partum [17]. joint laxity is a known
risk factor for knee osteoarthritis [18,19]. as compared to the

rst trimester, at four months post-partum one study found
that in the anterior direction laxity increased, but in the
frontal plane and posterior direction it decreased [20]. there
are persistent changes in foot structure post-partum,
including decreases in the arch height and rigidity index,
along with increases in foot length and arch drop [21].
together, changes in foot structure along with knee ligament
properties could contribute to altered lower extremity
mechanics and thus increased risk for oa.

we also hypothesized that there would be differences in the
peak knee adduction moment, flexion moment, and internal
rotation moment during walking, as a consequence of
changes in lower extremity alignment experienced during
pregnancy and altered joint angles experienced postpartum.
