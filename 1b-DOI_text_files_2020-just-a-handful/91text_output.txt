in this study we were able to further knowledge of outreach and
engagement strategies for a segment of the population that is
disproportionately burdened by obesity and related health implications and
underrepresented in health-related research efforts. the success of this
work is not without limitations, however. we understand that given the

geographic location of the research (southern arizona, usa), the concept of
returning swap meet attendees had already sought additional information

or decided they were not interested. with respect to the specific messaging
strategies, we also need to consider that men who are may be concerned
with their current t health status or already thinking about making changes
to their health-related behavior could be more impacted by fear appeal-
based messaging as they are at an advanced level of the stages of change22
and may be receptive of any messaging they receive, something we did not
account for or measure. it also is important to note that while fear appeal

our findings suggested that fear appeal content messaging was the most
effective engagement approach, in general. nevertheless, data also suggest
that messaging based in positive masculinity also was successful in engaging
hispanic men, in particular. this is a consistent triangulation of our work
given our previous findings indicated that fear appeal- and positive
masculinity-based content can be a viable strategy to engage this population

behaviors that are based in addiction such as smoking or drug use as these
behaviors may be triggered by physical dependence.

fear appeal messaging relies on fear response as a result of potential harm
that will occur to individuals if a particular recommendation is not readily
adopted.223! fear appeal messaging is often used in political and public
health advertising campaigns in hopes of reducing behaviors, intentions,
and attitudes, findings of a recent meta-analysis swarested effectiveness of
research to occur. the fear-appeal-based visual displays that were employed
for this recruitment effort posed the silhouette of an overweight man with
supplemental information throughout his body about the potential risks of
overweight and obesity. in this instance, the objective was only to trigger the
initiation of a dialogue between potential participants and recruiters based
on participant curiosity, or inquiry for additional knowledge. men that
approached the recruitment table during the fear appeal phase of this study
consistently asked for additional information about our presence and how

 

gender norms, sociopolitical climate, health literacy, and research history
and climate, which are all important to consider in research engagement

and retention efforts.

there also is a need to consider differences in adherence to certain male-
identified sociocultural norms and how these affect research engagement-
related behavior as the gendered nature of some social and cultural
patterns may have an impact on message receptivity and successive
engagement efforts with hispanic communities. as seen in our previous

as its use was successful in engaging hispanic male participants — which is
consistent with emerging literature on masculinity and healthcare services
and research engagement. there has been increased attention to an
improved understanding of male health-related behaviors, particularly
focused on strength-based approaches to assessing the lives of healthy men
and attention focused on positive aspects of masculinity.22234 literature
suggest that there is an essential need to consider need to consider the
negative influences of expressions of masculinity and attempts to leverage
aspects which mav be beneficial to health.2225,as such. gendered behaviors
gender-based underpinnings of involvement in health-related research.
additionally, research suggests that researcher-participant matching triggers
a perception of research being collaborative and mutually beneficial,
successively increasing willingness to participate.2® nevertheless, both men
and women may be more responsive to initial contact coming from women
because of an elevated level of comfort. female recruiters may be seen as
less intimidating, more approachable, and non-threatening to potential
participants.

data collection

trained bilingual and bicultural staff collected health information survey
cards that elicited voluntarily self-reported demographic information
interested in participating in current or future obesity-related research. no
incentives were given for exchange of information. all study materials were
available in spanish and english and all study protocols were approved by
the university of arizona's institutional review board.

hispanic men have the highest prevalence of overweight and obesity among

was to evaluate messaging strategies to engage hispanic men in obesity-

related research. outreach took place in an outdoor marketplace in

were collected, 221 were from hispanic men. obesity, diabetes, and cancer
were identified as the most pertinent health concerns. fear appeal yielded

of obesity-related disease in the united states when compared to all other
racial/ethnic groups.24 despite the abundance of evidence suggesting that
adequate weight management will meaningfully reduce the risk of obesity-
related health consequences, there is limited literature on the best practices
to recruit and engage hispanic men in obesity-related research.
participation of hispanic men is critical to the investigation of diet and
physical activity related health disparities and interventions designed to

importantly, findings suggest that hispanic populations may not be readily
informed of access to, or appropriately invited to participate in research
programs.'®12 thus, the development of effective and sustainable programs
that prevent or remediate obesity-related disease in the hispanic
population, particularly for men, requires considerable participation of this
population in research. further, effective recruitment and increased

communication strategies for weight management related research targeted
at hispanic men should be based on three distinct core messaging
strategies; 1) fear appeal/fear arousal (hereafter referred to as fear appeal),

communication materials were tailored to illuminate the risks of being

both english and spanish and consisted of a silhouette of an overweight
man standing on a scale accompanied by large lettering that stated “the
consequences of obesity’. supplementary writing pointed at key physiological
regions of the man’s body highlighting potential negative health outcomes
of obesity (figure 1).
