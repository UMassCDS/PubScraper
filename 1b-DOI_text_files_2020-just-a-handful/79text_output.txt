9. conclusions and future directions

there have been major advances in the formulation,
characterization, and utilization of edible nanoemulsions
over the past decade or so. studies have shown that stable
nanoemulsions can be formulated from either synthetic or
natural ingredients. recently, however, there has been an
emphasis on formulating nanoemulsions from botanical
ingredients, such as plant-based oils and emulsifiers, due to
consumer desires for more label friendly comme:
products. there is accumulating evidence from in vitro and in
vivo studies showing that nanoemulsions are highly effective
at increasing the bioavailability and bioactivity of orally
administered hydrophobic bioactives, such as nutraceuticals,
vitamins, healthy lipids, and pharmaceuticals. in the future, it
will be important to establish the efficacy of these
formulations using human feeding studies, provided they are
shown to be safe for consumption first. moreover, more in

nanoemulsion-based systems, such as filled microgels,
clusters, or multilayer systems.

 

 

 
which would not be expected to have toxic effects because
these are normal digestion products.
8. potential toxicity of edible nanoemulsions

there has been some concern about the potential toxicity of
nanoparticles in foods [[178], [179], [180]]. however, the
nature of the nanoparticles concerned have a major influence
on their potential toxicity, e.g., their size, shape, charge, and
digestibility. nanoemulsions contain lipid nanoparticles that
may exhibit toxicity through various mechanisms as a result
of their small dimensions and the ingredients used to
formulate them. a number of the most important ones are
briefly highlighted here:

+ greater penetration through biological barriers: in principle,
nanoparticles can penetrate through biological barriers,
such as the mucus layer and epithelium cells, more easily
than larger particles [181]. in practice, most food-grade
nanoparticles can penetrate through biological barriers,
such as the mucus layer and epithelium cells, more easily
than larger particles [181]. in practice, most food-grade
nanoemulsions are rapidly digested by the enzymes
within the upper gastrointestinal tract (such as lipases
and proteases) and are therefore broken down before
reaching these biological barriers. nevertheless, there are
some potential exceptions. first, lipid droplets that are not
partially digested in the stomach do not produce free fatty
acids there, which the body normally uses as a signal to
regulate gastric emptying [181]. as a result, a hi;
concentration of lipid droplets may enter the small
intestine and not be fully digested before they reach the
epithelium cells. second, the droplets in nanoemulsions
formulated from indigestible oils (such as mineral oils) ar
resistant to digestion in the upper git [182]. asa result,
they may be able to penetrate through the mucus layer
and reach the epithelium cells (provided they do not
coalesce or flocculate first). third, nanoemulsions may be
encapsulated within indigestible food matrices (such as
dietary fiber coatings or microgels) prior to ingestion

 

 

coalesce or flocculate first). third, nanoemulsions may be
encapsulated within indigestible food matrices (such as
dietary fiber coatings or microgels) prior to ingestion
[171]. in this case, they may be released in the small
intestine and then travel through the mucus layer before
being fully digested. fourth, some of the components usec
to formulate nanoemulsions (such as surfactants and
alcohols) could increase the permeability of the
epithelium cells by disrupting the lipid bilayers, thereby
allowing the lipid droplets to penetrate through the cells
more easily [181]. finally, studies have found that there is
often an optimum nanoparticle size for absorption,
around 50 to 100nm [181].

+ increased bioavailability into a toxic level: many studies
have shown that nanoemulsions can increase the
bioavailability of hydrophobic bioactive substances [9].
usually, this enhancement is desirable because it
increases the bioactivity but there may be circumstances
where it is not. for instance, some bioactive agents have
been reported to promote adverse health effects when

 

mmasases the bioaceivaty hut titere may ve gicuttiseatices
where it is not. for instance, some bioactive agents have
been reported to promote adverse health effects when
consumed at high levels, e.g., increasing the levels of b-
carotene consumed has been reported to increase the risk
of lung cancer in smokers [183]. consequently, if
nanoemulsions greatly increase the bioavailability of
these substances in foods they could lead to health
problems in certain populations. similarh
nanoemulsions increase the bioavailability of any
undesirable (toxic) substances in foods (such as
pesticides) they may have adverse effects on health [141].

 

+ dysregulation of metabolism or hormonal system: bulk oils
or conventional emulsions are typically digested relatively
slowly because of their large lipid domains (small surface
areas), as a result, free fatty acids and monoglycerides are
released and absorbed relatively slowly leading to a
moderate increase in blood lipids (fig. 2). conversely,
nanoemulsions are digested rapidly, which could lead to a
spike in blood lipids. over time, this could lead to

i nal systems, e.g.

 

nanoemulsions are digested rapidly, which could lead to a
spike in blood lipids. over time, this could lead to
dysregulation of the metabolic and hormonal systems, e.g.
feelings of hunger and satiety. to the authors knowledge,
no research has previously been carried out in this area,
but this could be a fruitful area for future studies.

+ enhanced toxicity due to ingredients used: another
potential source of toxicity is related to the type and
amount of ingredients used to formulate nanoemulsions.
nanoemulsions are typically formulated using the same
ingredients as conventional emulsions, but higher
emulsifier levels are required to stabilize their higher
surface areas. some studies have shown that certain types
of food-grade emulsifiers potentially have adverse effects
on human health, eg,, by altering the gut microbiome or
permeability [181,[184], [185], [186], [187}]. in some cases,
nanoemulsions with small droplet sizes can only be
created using small molecule synthetic surfactants, which
may be more toxic than natural emulsifiers (such as
proteins or phospholipids).
created using small molecule synthetic surfactants, which
may be more toxic than natural emulsifiers (such as
proteins or phospholipids).

a number of researchers have carried out in vitro and in vivo
studies to assess the potential toxicity of various
nanoemulsion formulations [188]. the most common methoc
of assessing the potential toxicity of nanoemulsions is to use
cell culture models, typically model normal cells, such as
fibroblasts. as an example, the potential cytotoxicity of
unloaded and curcumin-loaded nanoemulsions was tested
using mouse fibroblasts (3t3) [118]. these studies showed
that neither type of nanoemulsion exhibited appreciable
cytotoxicity against the model normal cells, but the
curcumin-loaded nanoemulsions did exhibit strong
cytotoxicity against model colon cancer cells (ht29). a

ilar finding was reported for essential oil nanoemulsions,
which were reported to exhibit strong cytotoxicity against
ht-29 cells (ic59=12.5 g/ml), but much less against model
normal cells (huvec) (ic59=5oyg/ml) [123]. a study using
nanoemulsions loaded with a botanical extract (goldenberry)

 

 

 

 

ht-29 cells (ic59=12.5 ig/ml), but much less against model
normal cells (huvec) (ic59=5oyg/ml) [123]. a study using
nanoemulsions loaded with a botanical extract (goldenberry)
reported that they exhibited much stronger cytotoxicity
against cancer cells than non-cancer cells [124].
nanoemulsions formulated from tocopheryl polyethylene
glycol succinate (tpgs), lemon oil, tween-80, and water have
also been shown to be non-toxic when tested on hep g2 cells
[189]. in contrast, bergamot oil nanoemulsions have been
shown to exhibit some cytotoxic activity against caco 2 cells
when applied at sufficiently high levels, although these
authors did not expose the nanoemulsions to a simulated git
prior to applying them to the cells [190].

   

ina comprehensive in vitro (cell culture) study of the
potential toxicity of nanoemulsions it was shown that
loading bioactive agents within them (f-carotene), actually
increased their cytotoxicity [181]. this effect was mainly
attributed to the formation of reactive oxidative species
inside the cells due to oxidation and metabolism of b-
carotene. these authors passed the nanoemulsions through a
aimidated ware (rniaidiber rewelive uxtaative splay
inside the cells due to oxidation and metabolism of b-
carotene. these authors passed the nanoemulsions through a
imulated upper git and then applied them to a cell culture
model. the translocation of the ingredients was then
observed by confocal fluorescence microscopy, whereas the
cytotoxicity was determined using cell viability methods
(caco 2 cells). interestingly, they found for tween 80-
stabilized nanoemulsions the cytotoxicity actually increased
with increasing droplet diameter (45 to 200nm), although
these effects were only observed at relatively high doses. the
increased toxicity with increasing droplet size was attributed
to the higher concentration of non-absorbed surfactants
(tween 80) and alcohol (ethanol) in the nanoemulsions,
which were able to disrupt the cell membranes. overall, the
authors suggested that the toxicity of the nanoemulsions was
not due to their small size but due to the presence of specific
ingredients (such as surfactants, alcohols, and carotenoids).

 

recently, an in vivo study was carried out using male wistar
rats to assess the potential toxicity of nanoemulsions [188].
the nanoemulsions were orally administered to the rats for
recently, an in vivo study was carried out using male wistar
rats to assess the potential toxicity of nanoemulsions [188].
the nanoemulsions were orally administered to the rats for
21 days at lipid concentrations of 200, 400 or 800mg/kg body
weight. the authors then sacrificed the rats and measured
“biochemical, hematological, oxidative stress, and
genotoxicity parameters”. oral ingestion of the
nanoemulsions did not alter the organ weights or

jochemical parameters of the rats compared to the controls.
the authors concluded that “the results from this study
suggest that [nanoemulsions] can be considered safe for oral
administration.

 

taken together, these results suggest that nanoemulsions do
not typically exhibit strong cytotoxic effects, provided they
are formulated using food-grade ingredients. the small
droplet size means that they are rapidly converted into
monoglycerides and free fatty acids in the small intestine,
which would not be expected to have toxic effects because
these are normal digestion products.
7.3. lipid droplet clustering

in many applications it is desirable for the droplets in
nanoemulsions to be isolated from each other, since this
improves the overall stability of the systems. in some cases,
however, it may be useful to promote controlled clustering of
the lipid droplets in nanoemulsions (fig. 6) [159]. for
instance, clustering can lead to an increase in the viscosity or
gel strength of a nanoemulsion, which may be useful for the
creating of highly viscous or semi-solid materials, such as.
creams or pastes [160,161]. this approach has been used to
enhance the mouthfeel of nanoemulsions by increasing their
perceived creaminess and thickness [162]. moreover,

creams or pastés'| 160,161. this approach’has been used to
enhance the mouthfeel of nanoemulsions by increasing their
perceived creaminess and thickness [162]. moreover,
clustering of oil droplets inside the gastrointestinal tract can
reduce the rate of lipid digestion, which may prolong the
release of encapsulated bioactive components [[163], [164],
[165]. the clustering of emulsifier-coated oil droplets can be
controlled by manipulating the attractive and repulsive
interactions acting between them, such as the electrostatic,
hydrophobic, depletion, and/or bridging forces [166].

7a. particle coating

the small lipid droplets in nanoemulsions can be used to coat
larger particles, such as microgels, to alter their functional
attributes [167] (fig. 6). typically, this is achieved by inducing
an attractive interaction between the surfaces of the
emulsifier-coated lipid droplets and the surfaces of the larger
particles. electrostatic attraction is typically used for this
purpose, e.g., cationic lipid droplets can be made to form a
coating around anionic microgels. this approach may be
useful for creating reduced calorie food products ~ a microgel
purpose, e.g., cationic lipid droplets can be made to form a
coating around anionic microgels. this approach may be
useful for creating reduced calorie food products - a microgel
coated with lipid droplets may exhibit similar characteristics
as a larger fat droplet, thereby reducing the overall fat
content of the system.

7.5. microgel encapsulation

finally, lipid droplets can be embedded inside larger particles
to alter their functional properties [[ 168], [169], [170]]. for
instance, nanoemulsion droplets can be trapped inside
biopolymer microgels (fig. 6). these filled microgels can be
formed by mixing a nanoemulsion with a gelling biopolymer
(such as alginate) and then injecting the mixture into a
gelling solution (such as calcium chloride). this process leads
to the formation of microgel particles with small lipid
droplets trapped within them. the composition, external
imensions, shape, pore size, and charge characteristics of
the microgels can be controlled by using different ingredients
and processing methods to formulate them. in addition, lipid
diardasiviny drapes pore'siag withinayeatalatersiewal
the microgels can be controlled by using different ingredients
and processing methods to formulate them. in addition, lipid
droplets can be encapsulated within microgel-in-microgel
systems [171] (fig. 6), where each microgel phase may be
made of a similar or different type of biopolymer. as a result,
delivery systems with a broad range of functional attributes
can be created. for instance, encapsulation of bioactive-
loaded lipid droplets inside microgels can be used to protect
the bioactive agents from chemical degradation during
storage [[172], [173], [174]]. alternatively, encapsulation can
be used to prolong the release of a bioactive component, such
as a hydrophobic flavor molecule during cooking [175,176].
biopolymer microgels have also been used to control the
gastrointestinal fate of nanoemulsions. for instance,
encapsulation of the lipid droplets can slow down the rate of
lipid digestion under simulated git conditions, as well as
prolong the release of bioactive components [171,177].

 

 

there are numerous other strategies that can be employed to
improve nanoemulsion performance, but these few examples
highlight the potential of using these approaches. as a result,

the functional properties of nanoemulsion-based systems car
be extended and tailored for specific applications.
7.2. interfacial engineering

the lipid droplets in nanoemulsions can be coated with
layers of edible biopolymers to enhance their stability and
functionality (fig. 6) [[153], [154], [155]]. typically, the
electrostatic layer-by-layer (ll) method is used to form
laminated biopolymer layers around emulsifier-coated lipid
droplets [156]. first, a nanoemulsion is created using an
electrostatic layer-by-layer (ll) method is used to form
laminated biopolymer layers around emulsifier-coated lipid
droplets [156]. first, a nanoemulsion is created using an
electrically charged emulsifier, such as an ionic surfactant,
phospholipid, or protein (1-layer system). second, this
nanoemulsion is mixed with a solution of biopolymers with
an opposite charge to the emulsifier-coated lipid droplets,
which causes a layer of biopolymers to form around the lipid
droplets (2-layer system). third, the nanoemulsion is then
mixed with another biopolymer solution that has an opposite
charge to the first biopolymer, which causes a second layer of
biopolymer to form around the lipid droplets (3-layer
system). this process can be repeated numerous times to
create multiple layers around the lipid droplets. the
functional performance of a nanoemulsion can be modulated
by controlling the composition, thickness, and external
charge of the nanolaminated coatings [157]. this can be
achieved by using different types, numbers, and sequences of
biopolymers to carry out the coating. numerous studies have
shown that this approach can be used to increase the
resistance of nanoemulsions to environmental stresses

 

 

(such,
polymers to carry out the coating. numerous studies have
shown that this approach can be used to increase the
resistance of nanoemulsions to environmental stresses (such
as changes in ph, ionic strength, heating, freezing, and
dehydration), to protect encapsulated substances from
chemical degradation during storage, and to control the
gastrointestinal fate of bioactives [153,158].

 

 
7,1. lipid phase solidification

the lipid core of nanoemulsion droplets can be fully or
partially crystallized by careful selection of the type of lipids
used, as well as the thermal history of the system (fig. 6)
{[143], [144], [145], [146], [147]]. this is typically achieved
using long-chain saturated triacylglycerols (digestible) or
edible waxes (indigestible). when the lipid phase is fully
crystallized, the particles are usually referred to as solid lipid
nanoparticles (slns) but when it is only partially crystallized,
they are referred to as nanostructured lipid carriers (nlcs).
crystalline lipid nanoparticles can be used to protect
nanoparticles (slns) but when it is only partially crystallized,
they are referred to as nanostructured lipid carriers (nlcs).
crystalline lipid nanoparticles can be used to protect
encapsulated bioactive components from release or from
chemical degradation during storage, since the diffusion
coefficient of the bioactives or other components within the
particle matrix is reduced [148]. moreover, they can be used
to reduce lipid digestion or prolong bioactive release, since
solid nanoparticles are digested more slowly than equivalent
lipid nanoparticles [[149}, [150], [151], [152]]. nevertheless,
the slns or nlcs have to be carefully formulated to ensure
they are physically stable and have the required functional
performance.

nanoemulsions have some advantages due to their small
particle sizes but they also have some disadvantages for the
same reason. for instance, bioactive release rates tend to be
very rapid due to the small particle dimensions and bioactive
degradation rates tend to be rapid due to the high droplet
saiie feason. for iistance, bivachve reieasé fates tend to be
very rapid due to the small particle dimensions and bioactive
degradation rates tend to be rapid due to the high droplet
surface area. the functional performance of nanoemulsions
can be improved using a variety of strategies, a few of which
are shown schematically in fig. 6. a brief overview of these
strategies is given here, along with some of their potential
applications.
6.6. excipient foods

recently, “excipient” nanoemulsions have been developed to
increase the bioavailability of hydrophobic substances (such
as vitamins and nutraceuticals) in co-ingested foods [40,131].
excipient nanoemulsions are typically oil-in-water systems
whose composition and structure are carefully controlled to
create an environment within the human gut that boosts the
joaccessibility, stability, and/or absorption of co-ingested
bioactive substances [132]. excipient nanoemulsions could be
used as a basis to form a variety of products intended for use
in the food or supplement industries: (i) cooking sauces that
are consumed with cooked vegetables; (ii) salad dressings
that are poured onto salads; (iii) rich creams that are poured

 

 

 

in the food or supplement industries: (i) cooking sauces that
are consumed with cooked vegetables; (ii) salad dressings
that are poured onto salads; (iii) rich creams that are poured
onto fruit; or (iv) creamy beverages that are drunk with
nutritional supplements. nanoemulsions are especially
suitable for this purpose because they can be designed to
contain small oil droplets that are quickly digested within the
human gut, thereby rapidly producing mixed micelles that
can solubilize and transport the hydrophobic substances
liberated from the foods or supplements consumed with
them [133], [134], [135]. previously, it has been shown that

ipient nanoemulsions can enhance carotenoid
ioaccessibility in spinach [135,136], tomatoes [137], carrots
[138], and dietary supplements (capsules and pills) [139]. it
should be noted, excipient nanoemulsions also have the
potential to enhance the bioavailability of potentially harmful
hydrophobic substances in foods, e.g,, the pesticides used to
treat agricultural produce [{140], [141], [142]]. nevertheless,
these studies suggest that only highly hydrophobic pesticides
are impacted by the presence of excipient nanoemulsions.

these studies suggest that only highly hydrophobic pesticides
are impacted by the presence of excipient nanoemulsions.
the nature of the lipid phase used to formulate excipient
nanoemulsions is important because it determines the
solubilization capacity of the mixed micelles formed within
the small intestine, thereby influencing the bioaccessibility of
hydrophobic substances in foods. nevertheless, other
components can also be added to excipient nanoemulsions to
lity of hydrophobic substances, such
their chemical degradation (such as
antioxidants and chelating agents) or substances to increase
their absorption (such as permeation enhancers or efflux
inhibitors).

the utilization of nanoemulsion-based delivery systems for
cannabinoids, such as thc or cbd, has been a growing area
over the past few years, with numerous examples of
commercial companies using this technology to create
cannabis-fortified edibles [35]. nevertheless, there have only
been afewacadeic ny dlications inshicatea dus f9 the fact
commercial companies using this technology to create

ied edibles [35]. nevertheless, there have only
been a few academic publications in this area due to the fact
that cannabinoids are not legal in many states and countries.
even so, there has been considerable progress made by
industrial researchers who have created a range of cannabis
edible products using nanoemulsions. the nanoemulsions are
used to encapsulate the cannabinoids, protect them from
degradation during storage, and then produce a specific
pharmacokinetic profile after ingestion. typically, a rapid
release of cannabinoids into the bloodstream is desirable so
as to quickly get the desired effects. in one academic study,
reported in a conference abstract, nanoemulsions were used
to incorporate cannabis into beverages [127]. in another
study, a combination of fermentation and sonication were
used to prepare emulsified cannabis formulations suitable for
incorporation into beverage products [127]. researchers have
also prepared oil-in-water nanoemulsions from hemp oil
[128,129], and examined the factors that impact their
physical and oxidative stability during storage [130]. this are

to more reliable and efficacious cannabinoid formulations.

6.4. nutraceuticals

nanoemulsions have been widely used as a means of
encapsulating, protecting, and delivering hydrophobic
nutraceuticals [9,11,42]. typically, the nutraceuticals are
dissolved in the oil phase prior to homogenizing the
nanoemulsions, the loading capacity of the nanoemulsions is
then determined by the maximum solubility of the
nutraceutical in the oil phase under the conditions used

 

then determined by the maximum solubility of the
nutraceutical in the oil phase under the conditions used
(particularly storage temperature), as well as the amount of
oil droplets present in the final product. in some situations,
the nutraceuticals can be added to a nanoemulsion after it
has been formed. for instance, curcumin can be incorporated
into nanoemulsions by adding it as a powder and then
heating [106], dissolving it in an organic solvent and then
mixing, or dissolving it in an alkaline solution and then
mixing [107]. there have been a huge number of studies on
the utilization of nanoemulsions for this purpose, and so only
a few examples are given here, with a focus on in vivo studies
of their bioavailability and/or bioactivity.

 

 

many researchers have used in vitro digestion models to
study the impact of nanoemulsion composition and structure

on the bioaccessibility of encapsulated hydrophobic

 

nutraceuticals, which has been reviewed in detail recently
[42]. in general, these studies show that nutraceutical
lity depends on many factor

 

jity depends on many factors, including oil
droplet content, oil droplet size, oil digestibility, and
emulsifier type [9,42]. typically, bioaccessibility increases
with decreasing droplet size, since this leads to faster and
more complete lipid digestion. the dimensions of the
hydrophobic domains within the mixed micelles (micelles
and vesicles) formed after lipid digestion are also important.
to be solubilized within the intestinal fluids, nutraceuticals
must be small enough to fit inside the hydrophobic domains
inside the mixed micelles. it is for this reason that long
hydrophobic molecules, like b-carotene, have a high
bioaccessibility when delivered in nanoemulsions formulated
from long-chain triglycerides but not in those formulated
from medium-chain triglycerides [108]. in vitro digestion
studies have shown that nanoemulsions can increase the
ity of many different nutraceuticals, including b-
carotene [109,110], lycopene [[111}, [112], [113]], lu
[114,115], astaxanthin [116,117], curcumin [106,107,118],
pterostilbene [119] and quercetin [120,121]. it should be
noted. however, that reducing the lipid droplet sizedges not
[114,115], astaxanthin [116,117], curcumin [106,107,118],
pterostilbene [119] and quercetin [120,121]. it should be
noted, however, that reducing the lipid droplet size does not
always improve the bioavailability of nutraceuticals. for
instance, it has recently been shown that the chemical
degradation of curcumin is worse in nanoemulsions than
conventional emulsions because of the larger surface area of
the oil droplets in the former [122]. consequently, it may be
important to optimize nanoemulsion-based delivery systems
to obtain good bioaccessibility and chemical stability.

to exhibit anticancer (apoptotic and cytotoxic effects) on

anticancer nanoemulsions was much lower on model normal
cells (huvec) than on the model cancer cells, with the ics

formulated using a mixture of non-ionic surfactants (tween
80 and span 80, using medium chain triglycerides (mct) as a
carrier oil.

an in vitro and in vivo study has been cartied out to establish
the impact of tea polyphenols on the storage stability and
gastrointestinal fate of ingested nanoemulsions containing b-
carotene [123]. the incorporation of tea polyphenols in the
water phase of the tween 80-stabilized nanoemulsions
increased the chemical stability of the carotenoids during
storage, which was attributed to the antioxidant activity of
the polyphenols. the nanoemulsions were then orally
administered to sprague-dawley (sd) rats. later, the rats
were euthanized and the liver, feces, and contents of their gi
tracts (small and large intestine) were collected and analyzed

the ability of nanoemulsions to increase the bioavailability of
curcumin has been assessed using a combination of in vitro
and in vivo methods [118]. these nanoemulsions were
stabilized using a thiol-modified chitosan. the curcumin-
loaded nanoemulsions did not exhibit any cytotoxicity on
model normal cells (mouse fibroblasts) but they did exhibit
cytotoxicity against model colon cancer cells (ht29). a
pharmacokinetic study showed that the nanoemulsions led
toa faster and higher level of curcumin in the bloodstream
after oral administration than for the non-encapsulated
systems. moreover, they showed that the presence of

piperine increased the concentration of curcumin in the
blood, which was attributed the ability to block efflux
mechanisms in the epithelium cells. the in vivo rat feeding
study also showed that the anti-inflammatory properties of
the curcumin were enhanced after it was loaded into
nanoemulsions, especially in the presence of piperine, which
was mainly attributed to the increase in overall

bioavailability. another recent in vivo study showed that
nanoemulsions were more effective than emulsions at
increasing the bioavailability of curcumin when orally
administered to wistar rats [59]. the authors also showed
that using conjugated linoleic acid (cla) to formulate the
nanoemulsions led to a higher curcumin bioavailability than
using fish oil. these studies highlight the importance of
optimizing the formulation of nanoemulsions to enhance
their biological activity.

 

 

nanoemulsions have also been used to orally deliver
quercetin, which is a nutraceutical that is claimed to have
effects [125]. in vitro cell culture studies (caco-2
cell) showed that quercetin loaded in nanoemulsions had a

quercetin, which is a nutraceutical that is claimed to have
anti-obesity effects [125]. in vitro cell culture studies (caco-2
cell) showed that quercetin loaded in nanoemulsions had a
3.4-fold higher absorption than free quercetin, moreover, an
in vivo study that involved oral administration of the samples
to mice showed that the nanoemulsion form of quercetin had
about a 34-fold higher oral bioavailability than the free
quercetin. finally, there was a greater reduction in weight
gain (around 24%) by rats fed a high fat diet for the
nanoemulsions. similarly, an in vivo study showed that
nanoemulsions increased the oral bioavailability of
coenzyme q10 (compared to a bulk oily formulation) when
orally administered to male wistar rats [126].
6.3. vitamins

nanoemulsions have been used to encapsulate a number of
different kinds of oil-soluble vitamins to improve their
dispersibility, stability, bioavailability, and bioactivity. as an
example, vitamin a (retinol) has been encapsulated in
nanoemulsions formulated from different kinds of oils and
emulsifiers [102]. the authors reported that the degradation
of vitamin a during storage could be inhibited by selection of
an appropriate combination of emulsifier and oil.

the impact of encapsulating vitamin d3 (cholecalciferol) in
nanoemulsions on its in vitro and in vivo bioavailability have
been assessed [103]. the in vitro experiments, which were
carried out using a simulated git model, showed that the
vitamin d3 had a higher bioaccessibility when encapsulated
in nanoemulsions than in emulsions. the in vivo experiments
which involved oral administration of the samples to mice,
showed that the serum 25(oh)d-3 levels increased by about
36% and 73% compared to the control for the emulsions and

ions . : iobting the abilievof
showed that the serum 25(oh)d-3 levels increased by about
36% and 73% compared to the control for the emulsions and
nanoemulsions respectively, again highlighting the ability of
the nanoemulsions to improve the oral bioavailability. these
effects were attributed to the faster and more extensive
digestion of the nanoemulsions due to their higher surface
areas.

the efficiency of nanoemulsions at increasing the
bioavailability of vitamin d, (ergocalciferol) has also been
examined using a combination of in vitro and in vivo studies
[68]. the in vitro studies, which were performed using a
simulated git model, indicated that the vitamin

ity increased with decreasing droplet size, which
was linked to a faster rate of lipid digestion and micelle
solubilization. interestingly, the in vivo studies, which
involved oral administration of the samples to rats indicated
that vitamin absorption was higher for emulsions than
nanoemulsions, the authors attributed this poor in vitro-in

(rather than measuring the full pharmacokinetic profile).

 

was shown that vitamin d-

 

in an in vitro bioactivity study,
fortified nanoemulsions exhibited cytotoxicity to model
human colorectal cancer cell lines hct116 and ht29 [104].
the nanoemulsions in this study consisted of vitamin d-
loaded oil droplets that were coated by a layer of pea protein,
with pectin added as an extra stabilizer. the authors
suggested that the vitamin d was released from the oil
droplets and interfered with key biochemical pathways,
leading to cell growth arrest and apoptosis.

in another bioactivity study, the potential of nanoemulsions
to increase the anticancer effects of a vitamin e analog (a-
tocopherol succinate) was examined [105]. the authors
showed that encapsulating the vitamin e analog in
nanoemulsions increased its anticancer activity against a
tocopherol succinate) was examined [105]. the authors
showed that encapsulating the vitamin e analog in
nanoemulsions increased its anticancer activity against a
model human breast cancer cell line (mcf-7) and a human
oral epithelial cancer cell line (kb), relative to the bulk form.
in addition, an in vivo study where the samples were orally
administered to rats showed that the nanoemulsion form of
the vitamin analog led to a higher bioavailability than the
bulk form. moreover, pharmacokinetic studies showed that
there was a faster and higher rise in the blood serum levels
for the nanoemulsions than the bulk form.
6.3. vitamins
6.2. antimicrobials

there has been great interest in the utilization of oil-in-water
nanoemulsions to encapsulate natural antimicrobials,
particularly essential oils, over the past few years [79]. [80],
[81]. essential oils are hydrophobic liquids that can be
isolated from many kinds of plants, which often contain a
variety of different antimicrobial constituents [82]. this is
probably because these substances are secreted by plants to
protect them from a variety of predators, such as microbes,
insects, or herbivores. the key molecular mechanisms
responsible for the antimicrobial action of essential oils are
believed to be disruption of the microbial cell walls and
interference with key biochemical pathways [82]. due to the
increasing interest from consumers in clean-label foods, the
food industry has been trying to identify effective
alternatives to synthetic antimicrobial agents. essential oils
are hydrophobic liquids that are largely insoluble in water.

 

food industry has been trying to identify effective
alternatives to synthetic antimicrobial agents. essential oils
are hydrophobic liquids that are largely insoluble in water.
consequently, for many applications, they need to be
converted into colloidal dispersions containing essential oil-
rich colloidal particles dispersed in water. oil-i
nanoemulsions are particularly suitable for this purpose since
they can easily be formulated using food grade ingredients
using existing production technologies. typically, essential oi
nanoemulsions are fabricated from an essential oil, a ripening
‘or, an emulsifier, and water, but other components
may sometimes be incorporated. for instance, other kinds of
antimicrobial phytochemicals can also be included in the oil
droplets. in this section, a brief overview of recent research
on the development of antimicrobial nanoemulsions is given.

many of studies have shown that a ripening inhibitor is
essential for formulating antimicrobial nanoemulsions from
essential oils [83,84]. a ripening inhibitor is a strongly
hydrophobic oil that has a very low water-solubility, such as a
medium- or long-chain triglyceride oil (such as mct, corn, or

 

 

 

essential oils [83,84]. a ripening inhibitor is a strongly
hydrophobic oil that has a very low water-solubility, such as a
medium- or long-chain triglyceride oil (such as mct, corn, or
sunflower oils). it is typically mixed with the oil phase prior
to homogenization. the presence of the ripening in!
slows down droplet growth due to ostwald ripening through
an entropy of mixing effect. a major trend in this area has
been the formulation of all-natural antimicrobial
nanoemulsions [5]. in this case, natural emulsifiers (such as
saponins, proteins, or phospholipids) are used to replace the
synthetic ones that are typically used (such as tweens and
spans). as an example, antimicrobial thymol-nanoemulsions
have been formulated using a mixture of lecithin and gelatin
as emulsifiers to stabilize them [85]. similarly, antimicrobial
thyme oil-nanoemulsions have been formulated using
sodium caseinate as an emulsifier [86]. other studies have
shown that antimicrobial essential oil nanoemulsions can be
stabilized by soy lecithin [87,88], quillaja saponins [{88], [89],
[90]], and bovine serum albumin [88] these studies indicate

that it is possible to create clean-label antimicrobial
nanoemulsions that are efficacious and should be better for
the environment and human health.

another area where there have been considerable advances
in recent years is the application of antimicrobial
nanoemulsions to real food products. for instance, research
has shown that hexanal-nanoemulsions were effective at
inactivating both spoilage and pathogenic organisms in apple
juice, without altering their desirable organoleptic properties
[91]. similarly, cinnamon oil nanoemulsions have been
shown to be effective at inhibiting spoilage and pathogenic
organisms (listeria monocytogenes and salmonella spp.) on
melons [92]. research has shown that carvacrol
nanoemulsions can be used to inhibit microbial growth
(salmonella enterica enteritidis and escherichia coli 0157:h7)
in contaminated mung bean and alfalfa seeds [93,94],
broccoli and radish seeds [94,95]. geraniol and carvacrol
loaded nanoemulsions have been used as antimicrobial
treatments for meat products, where they were shown to
inoevir ha taalki seah spot, 35; 'ceraid ahercdvaeror
loaded nanoemulsions have been used as antimicrobial
treatments for meat products, where they were shown to
increase the shelf life of fresh goat meat [96]. in these
examples, it is important that the antimicrobial
nanoemulsions do not adversely affect the desirable
organoleptic properties of the foods, such as their
appearance, mouthfeel, or flavor profile. thus, it is important
to select an essential oil that is compatible with the food that
the nanoemulsion is applied to.

  

 

antimicrobial nanoemulsions have also been incorporated
into edible coatings and packaging materials to increase the
shelf life of foods [97,98]. in this case, the nanoemulsions are
usually mixed with natural polymers prior to casting the
coatings or films. the essential oils then slowly leach out of
the coatings or films over time, which helps to inactivate or
the growth of microbes, yeasts, or molds. the
essential oils may diffuse through the films as individual
molecules or inside oil droplets, depending on the pore size
and interactions within the polymer network. as an example,

and interactions within the polymer network. as an example,
thymol-, cinnamaldehyde-, and eugenol-based
nanoemulsions have been incorporated into biodegradable
films formed from pullulan and their release properties have
been studied [99]. thymol oil-nanoemulsions have been
loaded into gelatin films and demonstrated to exhibit good
antimicrobial activity [85]. the thymol was gradually
released from the gelatin films and was effective at inhibiting
both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria. essential
nanoemulsions containing cinnamaldehyde and garlic oil
have been loaded into composite biopolymer films prepared
using gelatin and chitosan, where they were shown to exhibit
good antimicrobial properties against pseudomonas
aeruginosa [100]. finally, thymus daenensis oil-based
nanoemulsions have been incorporated into hydroxypropyl
methyl cellulose edible films and shown to exhibit good
antimicrobial properties [101].

 

 
6. applications

6.1. healthy lipids: omega-3 fatty acids and
conjugated linoleic acids

nanoemulsions have been used to encapsulate flaxseed oil,
which is rich in alpha-linoleic acids, an important source of
plant-based omega-3 fatty acids in the diet [76]. the

alginate to stabilize them. the whey protein acted as an
emulsifier that adsorbed to lipid droplet surfaces, while the
sodium alginate formed a protective polysaccharide coating
around the protein-stabilized lipid droplets. in an in vivo
feeding study using broiler chickens, the authors showed that

 
 

sodium alginate formed a protective polysaccharide coating
around the protein-stabilized lipid droplets. in an in vivo
feeding study using broiler chickens, the authors showed that
the level of omega-3 fatty acids in the flesh of the chickens
was appreciably higher when emulsified flaxseed oil was
used rather than bulk flaxseed oil. this result can be
attributed to the faster and more extensive digestion of the
small oil droplets within the gastrointestinal tracts of the
rds. in this example, nanoemulsions may be used as
effective delivery systems to increase the healthy lipid profile
of meat products.

 

an in vivo animal study has been used to study the efficacy of
nanoemulsions at delivering a bioactive oil rich in
tocopherols: kenaf (hibiscus cannabinus l.) seed oil [77].
these systems were stabilized using complexes of b-
cyclodextrin, sodium caseinate and tween 20. the
researchers compared the pharmacokinetic profiles of
nanoemulsions, emulsions, and bulk oil after oral
administration to adult female sprague-dawley rats. in
general, the level of tocopherols detected in the animal's
neassiraanis;eatasensraneial wands uraving order
administration to adult female sprague-dawley rats. in
general, the level of tocopherols detected in the animal's
bloodstream increased more rapidly in the following order:
nanoemulsions > emulsions > bulk oil. after 180min, the
bioavailability of the tocopherols in the blood was 1.4- and
1.7-fold higher in the nanoemulsions than in the emulsions
and bulk oil, respectively. this result can again be at
to the faster and more extensive digestion of the lipi
as its surface area increases (particle size decreases). these
results were consistent with an earlier in vitro study by the
same authors that showed the nanoemulsions were digested
more rapidly and had a higher bioaccessibility than bulk oil
[54]. hence, their appeared to be a good in vitro-in vivo
correlation, at least qualitatively, for this system.

 

  
 

in another in vivo animal study using hypercholesterolemic
sprague-dawley rats, the same authors examined the impact
of delivery format (nanoemulsion, emulsion, or bulk oil) on
the ability of kenaf seed oil to reduce cholesterol levels [78].
the nanoemulsion format was shown to exhibit the strongest
cholesterol-lowering effects, as well as the strongest weight
the ability of kenaf seed oil to reduce cholesterol levels [78].
the nanoemulsion format was shown to exhibit the strongest
cholesterol-lowering effects, as well as the strongest weight
control and reduced liver fat levels, which was mainly
attributed to the higher bioavailability of the kenaf seed oil
when it was encapsulated within small lipid droplets.

ina human feeding study, it was shown that administering ar
@-3-rich algal oil in a nanoemulsion form improved its
joavailability compared to a bulk oil form [61]. the authors
incorporated the different forms of algal oil into a model
yogurt product and used a randomized crossover design (11
participants) to study the pharmacokinetics. their results
showed that the blood levels of w-3 fatty acids were
significantly higher for the nanoemulsion than for the bulk
oil, which indicated that nanoemulsions could be used to
enhance the bioavailability of these healthy lipids. in another
human feeding study, a randomized crossover design (47
participants) showed that «-3-rich cod liver oil had a
significantly higher oral bioavailability when administered in
an emulsified form than in a bulk form [62].

5.2. in vivo gastrointestinal studies

a more accurate understanding of how nanoemulsions
behave inside the human gut can often be obtained using
animal feeding studies [59,60]. a nanoemulsion formulation
is usually prepared and then orally administered to animals
(usually rats or mice). typically, this is done by oral gavage,
which involves placing the nanoemulsion in a syringe and
then injecting it directly into the animal's stomach. the
advantage of this method is that the amount of
nanoemulsion administered to the animal can be carefully
controlled. however, itis also possible to have the animal

controlled. however, it is also possible to have the animal
drink a liquid form of the nanoemulsion or to eat a powdered
form, which may be produced by freeze or spray drying. the
advantage of this approach is that it causes less discomfort to
the animal, and the nanoemulsion passes through the mouth
and esophagus, which could alter its properties. the
gastrointestinal fate of the nanoemulsion can then be
monitored by sacrificing the animal and measuring the
concentration, size, and properties of the oil droplets in
different regions of the git. in addition, the concentration of
the administered bioactive components can be measured in
the bloodstream and specific organs (such as the liver, kidney
heart, adipose tissue, muscles, intestinal tissue, brain, etc.)
after a fixed time [59]. ideally, measurements should be
made over a range of times using different animals to obtain
information about how the bioactives are absorbed by the
body, and then distributed, metabolized, and excreted. in
many studies, the concentration of the administered

ioactive agent and/or its metabolites is simply measured in
the bloodstream of the animal over time by periodically

ioactive agent and/or its metabolites is simply measured in
the bloodstream of the animal over time by periodically
taking blood samples [59]. thus, the impact of nanoemulsion
formulation (such as particle size, oil type, and emulsifier
type) on the pharmacokinetics of the bioactive component
can be established. pharmacokinetic experiments can also be
carried out using human feeding studies, provided the
formulation is known to be safe and appropriate approval has
been obtained [61]. however, few human studies have been
reported in the literature on the gastrointestinal fate of
ingested nanoemulsions. in one study, it was shown that
nanoemulsions improved the oral bioavailability of «-3 fatty
acids in humans after they were incorporated into yogurts,
when compared to a bulk oil [61]. in another human feeding
study, it was shown that emulsified cod liver oil had a

antly higher bioavailability than bulk cod liver oil [62]

bioaccessibility, bioavailability or pharmacokinetic studies of
ioactives usually involve comparing the results obtained
using different formulations (fig. 5). it is important to select
an appropriate reference sample to compare to the test
sample, otherwise the results will be misleading. the
gastrointestinal behavior of a hydrophobi
encapsulated within a test nanoemulsion may be compared
to various kinds of reference sample:

+ bulk form: in this case, a solid bioactive may be used ina
powdered bulk form [63] or a liquid bioactive may be
used ina fluid bulk form [61,64]. the bulk sample is then
simply mixed with simulated git fluids or administered
to an animal. this format often has a relatively low
bioaccessibility and bioavailability due to the large surface
area and poor solubility in gastrointestinal fluids;

 

 

\ctive

 

+ non-encapsulated dispersed form: in this case, a crystalline
bioactive is suspended in an aqueous or oily dispersion in
the form of small crystals [65]. typically, this format also
has a relatively low bioaccessibility and bioavailability for
the same reasons;
the form of small crystals [65]. typically, this format also
has a relatively low bioaccessi and bioavailability for
the same reasons;

 

+ dissolved form: in this case, a crystalline bioactive is
dissolved in a suitable organic solvent (like dmso)
[66,67]. this format may not give an accurate comparison,
since these organic solvents cannot be used in food
applications;

+ emulsion form: in this case, the bioactive is encapsulated
within a conventional emulsion (d>200nm), but the size
of the oil droplets used may vary considerably [68,69]. for
this reason, it is often informative to use emulsions with
different mean droplet diameters in the comparison (e.g.,
=500, 1000, 2000, 5000 and 10,000nm). typically, it is
important that the composition of the emulsion is si
to that of the test nanoemulsion (eg., oil and emulsifier
type) to make reliable comparisons.

 

+ nanoemulsion form: in this case, the bioactive is
encapsulated in another nanoemulsion (d<200nm) with a

+ nanoemulsion form: in this case, the bioactive is
encapsulated in another nanoemulsion (d<200nm) with a
different composition or structure. for instance,
nanoemulsions with different mean droplet diameters,
emulsifier types, or oil phase compositions could be
compared to the test nanoemulsion [[69), [70], [71] (72]]-

+ alternative delivery system form: the purpose of some
studies is to compare the efficacy of a test nanoemulsion
formulation with one or more other colloidal delivery
systems, such as biopolymer nanoparticles,
nanoliposomes, nanocrystals, or microgels [{73], [74],
(75il.
5. advances in assessing gastrointestinal fate of
nanoemulsions

knowledge about the potential gastrointestinal fate of
nanoemulsions has increased greatly over the past few years
as a result of the development and application of both in vitro
and in vivo testing methods [42,43].

5.1. in vitro gastrointestinal studies

many researchers are now using simulated gastrointestinal
models to understand how different nanoemulsion
formulations might behave inside the human gut [24,44,45].
a number of simulated git models have been developed for
this purpose, which vary in their sophistication, accuracy, an¢
ease of use, which often makes comparison of results from
different studies challenging [46,47]. for this reason,

ease of use, which often makes comparison of results from
different studies challenging [46,47]. for this reason,
standardized models have recently been developed for this
purpose. the most widely used of these models is the static
in vitro digestion method developed by the infogest
international consortium [46,48]. this consortium includes
an international network of scientists whose aim is to
improve the healthiness of foods by understanding how they
behave within the human gastrointestinal tract (www.cost-
infogest.eu). as part of this work, a standardized in vitro git
model was established to better simulate the events
occurring inside the human gut, as well as to harmonize the
results obtained from different research laboratories. the
infogest model is designed to simulate the mouth, stomach
and small intestine regions of the human git. it provides
detailed instructions on the conditions that should be used in
each region of the git, including incubation times,
mechanical forces, temperatures, ph values, mineral
compositions, enzyme activities, mucin levels, and bile salts
concentrations. in addition, it gives instructions on how the
aréereitardrces, terhperdtares; prrvaries, miner
compositions, enzyme activities, mucin levels, and bile salts
concentrations. in addition, it gives instructions on how the
data obtained should be collected, analyzed, and reported.
the infogest model is a “static” approach because the
conditions used in each region of the git are fixed. the
results of the infogest model have been compared to those
obtained in animal and human feeding studies, which has
shown that there is a good qualitative in vitro - in vivo
correlation in many cases [49,50]. asa result, the infogest
method is now widely used to rapidly test new formulations
intended for oral ingestion, which is reducing the need for
ethically challenging and costly animal and human studies. it
should be noted, however, that a simple static digestion
model cannot accurately reflect the complexity and diversity
of the human gut. this problem can partly be overcome by
using more sophisticated “dynamic” in vitro digestion
models, where the conditions in each gastrointestinal region
are varied over time, eg., by continuously pumping in acids,
enzymes, or bile salts based on feedback loops [49,51,52]. for
instance, dynai

    

 

 
 
  
 

are variea'’si
enzymes, or bile salts based on feedback loops [49,51,52]. for
instance, dynamic in vitro digestion models have been used tc
study the bioavailability and bioactivity of curcumin
encapsulated within nanoemulsions [53], as well as the
bioaccessibility of tocopherols in nanoemulsions [54].
although these dynamic models are better at simulating real
git conditions, they are more laborious, costly, and time-
consuming to carry out. moreover, the results obtained from
dynamic models are often more difficult to interpret. these
factors have limited their more widespread application.

 

in vitro digestion models are particularly useful for p:
insights into the changes in the structure and composition of
nanoemulsions as they pass through the git, the rate and
extent of macronutrient digestion, and the bioaccessibility of
encapsulated bioactive substances. they may also be used to
provide information about the chemical or biochemical
transformation of encapsulated components within the git
(such as oxidation or hydrolysis). occasionally, they have
been extended to provide insights into the potential

absorption of ives through the epith: lls lining
(such as oxidation or hydrolysis). occasionally, they have
been extended to provide insights into the potential
absorption of bioactives through the epithelium cells lining
the small intestine. for instance, some researchers have used
alysis bags to model the epithelium cells. the dialysis bags
are placed in the small intestinal fluids to measure the
concentration of the bioactive component that is released
from the test sample and then transported through the pores
[55]. a more sophisticated approach is to take the contents of
the digest produced after the small intestine phase, dilute it
with an appropriate buffer, and then place it on a cell culture
model of the epithelium cells, such as caco 2 cells [56,57].
the amount of the bioactive substances transported into or
through the model epithelium cells can then be determined,
as well as their packaging into lipoproteins, such as
chylomicrons [58]. in humans, hydrophobic bioactive
substances are usually packaged into chylomicrons within
the epithelium cells, which are small triacylglycerol-rich
particles coated by phospholipids and proteins, and then
carried through the lymphatic system to the bloodstream. it

particles coated by phospholipids and proteins, and then

should be noted that many researchers simply place their
formulated nanoemulsions on cell culture models, without
carrying out a digestion step first, which may lead to
unrealistic or misleading results.
a great deal of research on nanoemulsion-based delivery and
excipient systems has focused on formulating them to
increase the bioavailability of strongly hydrophobic
substances, like oil-soluble vitamins (a.d, e.andk),._.,
jent systems has focused on formulating them to
increase the bioavailability of strongly hydrophobic
substances, like oil-soluble vitamins (a, d, e, and k),
nutraceuticals, and long-chain triglycerides [9]. the rate
limiting step for many of these hydrophobic substances is
their bioaccessibility, which is the fraction taken up by the
mixed micelles in the small intestine [36]:

mixture of colloidal particles (such as micelles and vesicles)
that are comprised of bile acids and phospholipids (secreted
by the gut), as well as free fatty acids and monoacylglycerols
(generated during digestion of the ingested lipid).
hydrophobic bioactives are solubilized within the
hydrophobic interiors of the mixed micelles and then carried
to the epithelium cells where they can be absorbed [39]. one

of the advantages of using nanoemulsions to increase the
bioavailability of hydrophobic substances is that they are
rapidly and completely digested in the small intestine,
thereby releasing these substances. moreover, they rapidly
form mixed micelles that can solubilize the released
hydrophobic substances.

 

cintehors of

    

studies have been carried out to elucidate the link between
the composition and structure of nanoemulsions, the
properties of the mixed micelles formed in the small
intestine, and the bioaccessibility of bioactive substances [9].
these studies indicate that the hydrophobic domains inside
the mixed micelles (micelles and vesicles) have to be
sufficiently large to accommodate the bioactive substances
[40,41]. otherwise, they will remain in the aqueous phase
and may crystallize or form a separate oily phase, which
reduces their bioaccessibility. in general, the size,
composition, and physical state of the lipid droplets in
nanoemulsions has to be optimized to increase their

joaccessibility [91 -

fig. 3. the overall bioavailability of hydrophobic bioactives

 

encapsulated inside nanoemulsions depends on numerous
factors, including their bioaccessibility, absorption,

distribution, metabolism and excretion.
4. factors affecting bioavailability

one of the most important applications of nanoemulsions
within the food industry has been to increase the
joavailability of beneficial bioactive substances, such as oil-
soluble vitamins and phytochemicals [12,35]. for this reason,
it is important to understand the major factors that impact
the overall bioavailability (ba) of bioactive substances after
they have been ingested [36]. the bioavailability can be taken
to be the proportion on an ingested substance that reaches
the site of action within the body in a biologically active
form, which can be simplistically expressed by the following

eq. [37]:
ba(t)= b*(t) xa*(t)xd*(t)xm* (t) xe*(t) (a

 

the bioavailability depends on numerous events that occur

ba(t)= b"(t) x a*(t)xd" (t) m(t)" (t) (a

the bioavailability depends on numerous events that occur
within the human git and body [38], which are shown
schematically in fig. 3 [4]. in this expression, b*(t), a*(t), d®
(t), m*(t), and e*(t) represent the bioaccessibility, absorption,
distribution, metabolism, and excretion of the bioactive
substance over time (t) [36]. the bioaccessibility is the fractior
of the substance inside the git fluids that is in a form that
can be absorbed. for hydrophobic substances, this is usually
the fraction that is solubilized within the mixed micelle
phase, which is comprised of micelles and vesicles. the
absorption is the fraction of the bioaccessible substance in the
gut that passes through the epithelium cells and enters the
body. absorption may occur through a variety of passive or
active transport mechanisms. typically, more hydrophilic
substances pass through the epithelium layer and enter the
portal vein, where they then move to the liver before entering
the systemic circulation. in contrast, more hydrophobic
substances are packaged into lipoproteins within the
epithelium cells, which are then travel through the lymphatic

 

the systemic circulation. in contrast, more hydrophobic
substances are packaged into lipoproteins within the
epithelium cells, which are then travel through the lymphatic
system, before reaching the systemic circulation, thereby
avoiding first pass metabolism. the distribution reflects the
fraction of the bioactive substance located at the intended
site of action, which takes into account the fact that the
absorbed substance is distributed around the human body to
various tissues and organs. in practice, the concentration of
the substance in the systemic circulation (bloodstream),
rather than in specific tissues, is often used to represent the
effective concentration. the metabolism is the fraction of a
substance remaining within a biologically active form at the
site of action, taking into account any chemical or metabolic
changes that have occurred inside the gut and body. finally,
the excretion is the fraction of substance remaining at the site
of action after any of the normal excretion processes
operating in the body, such as expulsion through the urine,
feces, breath, or sweat, have occurred. in practice, the overall
bioavailability of a substance may be mainly determined by
one or more of these processes. the concentration of a

 

 

feces, breath, or sweat, have occurred. in practice, the overall
bioavailability of a substance may be mainly determined by
one or more of these processes. the concentration of a
joactive substance at a particular site in the body varies over
time after ingestion of a food because all of the processes
mentioned are time dependent. the resulting
pharmacokinetic profile of an ingested component
determines its bioactivity (fig. 4).

3. formulation and fabrication of nanoemulsions

in general, there are two main approaches for producing
nanoemulsions, which have been described in detail
elsewhere [10], [11], [12]]: low-energy and high-energy
fabrication methods. typically, low-energy methods are
based on the spontaneous formation of tiny oil droplets wher
the composition or temperature of a system containing oil,
water, and surfactant is changed in a specific way. this
category of methods includes spontaneous emulsification,
phase inversion temperature, and emulsion inversion
methods. in contrast, high-energy methods are based on
crue perira trans ar eid tam rate
phase inversion temperature, and emulsion inversion
methods. in contrast, high-energy methods are based on
applying intense mechanical forces to a mixture of oil, water,
and surfactant, which causes the oil phase to breakup into
tiny surfactant-coated oil droplets that are dispersed within
water. this category of methods includes microfluidization,
sonication, and high-pressure homogenization. a
considerable number of recent research efforts have focused
on identifying the optimum compositions and operating
conditions required to produce nanoemulsions using these
methods.

 

one of the main areas of focus in recent research has been on
creating nanoemulsions entirely from natural food
ingredients, rather than synthetic ones, due to increasing
consumer demands for clean label products [5,8]. in
particular, there has been great interest in using plant-based
(rather than animal-based) natural ingredients, such as oils,
phospholipids, proteins, polysaccharides, biosurfactants, or
saponins isolated from plant materials [5,8]. it has proved
very difficult to formulate nanoemulsions using low-energy

 

phospholipids, proteins, polysaccharides, biosurfactants, or
saponins isolated from plant materials [5,8]. it has proved
very difficult to formulate nanoemulsions using low-energy
methods from natural emulsifiers because they do not have
the required solubility characteristics and phase behavior
[13,14], high-energy methods are much more suitable for this
purpose since they can create nanoemulsions from a wide
range of different kinds of emulsifiers and oils [5,8]. typically
plant-based emulsifiers have to be highly water-soluble,
surface active, have rapid adsorption kinetics, and be present
at a high enough concentration to cover all the oil droplet
surfaces formed during homogenization. a number of plant-
based emulsifiers have these characteristics, including many
phospholipids, proteins, polysaccharides, biosurfactants, and
saponins.

 

 

a few examples of plant-based nanoemulsions prepared
using high-energy methods are given here. sonication has
been used to prepare nanoemulsions from a number of
different plant-based emulsifiers, including soy proteins, rice
proteins, peanut proteins [15], soy protein/phospholipid
been used to prepare nanoemiulsions from a number of
ifferent plant-based emulsifiers, including soy proteins, rice
proteins, peanut proteins [15], soy protein/phospholipid
mixtures [16], pea proteins [17,18], soy lecithin, tea saponins
[19]. and quillaja saponins [19]. similarly, microfluidization
has been used to prepare nanoemulsions from various kinds
of plant-based emulsifiers, including soy proteins [20], soy
protein-tea polyphenol complexes [21], soy protein-dextrin
conjugates [22], sesame proteins [23], lentil proteins [24,25],
pea proteins [26,27], pea protein-tannic acid complexes [28],
gum arabic [29], soy lecithin [30,31], sunflower lecithin [32],
quillaja saponin [33], and tea saponin [34]. the stability and
functionality of these nanoemulsions is highly dependent on
the nature of the plant-based emulsifier used to formulate
them. in some cases, the functional performance of protein-
coated oil droplets in nanoemulsions can often be improved
by adding charged polysaccharides that adsorb to the droplet
surfaces and form a protective coating [25]. taken together,
these studies indicate that nanoemulsions can be successfully
formulated from plant-based ingredients, at least using high-
energy homogenization methods, which may be important

 

these studies indicate that nanoemulsions can be successfully
formulated from plant-based ingredients, at least using high-
energy homogenization methods, which may be important
for many applications in the modern food industry.
2.2. nanoemulsions versus microemulsions

a major advantage of nanoemulsions over microemulsions is
that they can be formulated from a much wider range of
ingredients, such as emulsifiers and oils [1,3]. in particular,
nanoemulsions can be created from natural emulsifiers,
including proteins, polysaccharides, phospholipids,
biosurfactants, and saponins [{5], (6), [7], [8]}. this
becoming increasingly important as more and more
consumers are adopting commercial products that have
cleaner labels, which means that industry is trying to replace
synthetic ingredients with natural ones. in contrast, high
concentrations of synthetic surfactants are usually required
to prepare microemulsions, which is undesirable for cost,
taste, toxicity, and labeling reasons. another important
advantage is that nanoemulsions typically have a higher

taste, toxicity, and labeling reasons. another important
advantage is that nanoemulsions typically have a higher
loading capacity than microemulsions, ie., they can
incorporate more hydrophobic bioactives per unit mass of
delivery system [9]. this is mainly because microemulsions
only have a relatively small hydrophobic domain inside them
that can accommodate bioactives.

emulsions and microemulsions for the encapsulation and
delivery of hydrophobic bioactives.

2.1. nanoemulsions versus emulsions

the main advantages of nanoemulsions over emulsions are
related to the smaller size of the oil droplets in the
nanoemulsions [1,3]. when the mean droplet diameter is
below about 50nm, it is possible to create nanoemulsions
that are optically transparent, which is beneficial for some
applications, such as fortified waters, fruit juices, or soft
drinks. it should be noted, however, that it is often
challenging to create nanoemulsions containing droplets that
are this small. typically, high concentrations of synthetic
surfactants are required. when the droplet diameter is below
about 200nm, nanoemulsions are highly resistant to
gravitational separation (usually creaming), which is useful
for developing fluid formulations that are expected to have
an extended shelf-life. finally, the smaller size of the oil
droplets in nanoemulsions means that they are digested
more rapidly and fully in the gastrointestinal tract, which can

dispersion, despite having some similarities. unlike
nanoemulsions, microemulsions are thermodynamically
stable systems, ie, the separated components (usually oil,
water and surfactant) have a higher free energy than the
colloidal dispersion [3]. consequently, microemulsions
should form spontaneously when their constituents are
brought together. in practice, some external energy (such as
mixing and/or warming) is required to overcome kinetic
energy barriers between the separated and microemulsified
states. once formed, microemulsions should remain stable
indefinitely, provided their composition and the
environmental conditions are not altered, and there is no
shaesinal detersazcinnatmuirehsa as stavnia wakuh sds"
indefinitely, provided their composi
environmental conditions are not altered, and there is no
chemical degradation or microbial contamination. the reason
that microemulsions are thermodynamically stable, despite
having a large specific surface area, is because the interfacial
tension is very low when the surfactant monolayer adopts it's
optimum curvature [3]. as a result, entropy of mixing
dominates the overall free energy difference between the
separated and microemulsified states. like nanoemulsions,
microemulsions are dispersions of small emulsifier-coated oil
droplets in water, which can be used to encapsulate
hydrophobic bioactives. microemulsions are often optically
transparent and resistant to gravitational separation because
of their very small particle size, which is similar to
nanoemulsions that contain very small droplets.

a frequent source of confusion in this area is the difference
between emulsions, nanoemulsions, and microemulsions [3].
indeed, many of the papers published in this area employ
incorrect terminology when referring to the colloidal systems
they are working with. it is therefore important to clearly
distinguish between these systems. nanoemulsions and

distinguish between these systems. nanoemulsions and
emulsions are both thermodynamically unstable because the
free energy of the separate oil and water phases is lower than
that of the emulsified system. this is because of the positive
free energy (ag) required to increase the surface area (aa)
between the oil and water phases: ag=yaa, where y is the
interfacial tension [3]. from a thermodynamic perspective,
nanoemulsions are therefore less stable than emulsions
because they have a higher surface area, ie, there is a greater
driving force for them to separate. however, from a kinetic
perspective, nanoemulsions are usually much more stable
than emulsions because their smaller droplet size reduces the
tendency for gravitational separation
(creaming/sedimentation) or droplet aggregation
(coalescence/flocculation) to occur, ie., there is a higher
kinetic energy barrier between the emulsified and non-
emulsified states (fig. 2). the only difference between
nanoemulsions and emulsions is the droplet size. typically,
nanoemulsions are considered to have mean droplet
diameters below 200nm, whereas emulsions have them
nanoemulsions and émulsions is the droplet size. typically,
nanoemulsions are considered to have mean droplet
diameters below 200nm, whereas emulsions have them
above this value [4]. even so, there is currently no single
definition that is widely used. researchers often use different
mean diameters as the demarcation point between
nanoemulsions and emulsions, such as 100, 200, 500, or even
1000nm. moreover, it is not clear what mean droplet
diameter to use, eg., the number- (dj9), surface- (d32),
volume- (d,3), or intensity- (dz) weighted average [1]. it
should be noted that there are no dramatic changes in the
properties of these colloidal systems when the particle size
moves from above to below these critical cut-off points, but i
would be useful to have a more consistent definition. to be
consistent with government regulations on nanoparticles,
such as those of the european union, nanoemulsions should

1. introduction

nanoemulsions are a type of colloidal dispersion that consist:
of small droplets of one fluid dispersed in another immiscible
fluid [1,2]. typically, the two fluids are oil and water, but
other immiscible liquids can also be emulsified. there are
two common types of nanoemulsions that can be

two common types of nanoemulsions that can be
distinguished from each other by their structural
organization: oil-in-water (0/w) and water-in-oil (w/o)
types (fig. 1). o/w nanoemulsions consist of small oil
droplets dispersed within water, whereas w/o
nanoemulsions consists of small water droplets dispersed in
oil. nanoemulsions with more complicated structures are
also possible, such as w/o/w or 0/w/0 (fig. 1), but these are
less common, currently, 0/w nanoemulsions are the most
widely used for encapsulation and delivery purposes and so
they will be the main focus of this article.

abstract

the design, fabrication, and application of edible
nanoemulsions for the encapsulation and delivery of
joactive agents has been a highly active research field over
the past decade or so. in particular, they have been widely
used for the encapsulation and delivery of hydrophobic
ioactive substances, such as hydrophobic drugs, lipids,
vitamins, and phytochemicals. a great deal of progress has
been made in creating stable edible nanoemulsions that can
increase the stability and efficacy of these bioactive agents.
this article highlights some of the most important recent
advances within this area, including increasing the water-
dispersibility of bioactives, protecting bioactives from
chemical degradation during storage, increasing the
joavailability of bioactives after ingestion, and targeting the
release of bioactives within the gastrointestinal tract.
