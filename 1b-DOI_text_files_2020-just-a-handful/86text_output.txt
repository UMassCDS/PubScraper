pharmacological, was completely effective in eliminating sib in rhesus monkeys.
biting behavior was reduced, but in a majority of the cases, the animals relapsed
to their previous biting rate after the treatment was removed. treatment efficacy
has also proved to be problematic in human nssi. few treatments have been
developed that specifically target the sib (andover et al., 2020). additionally, a
meta-analysis of different behavioral therapies revealed small but positive effect
sizes for several of these therapies suggesting that the behavior was not
completely eliminated (kothgassner et al., 2020).

3.2 prevention

perhaps the most significant impact of our research program was in the area of
sib prevention. as described earlier, we and others expended considerable effort
to identify conditions that confer risk for sib development, which has led to
substantial changes in rearing and housing practices at neprc (before it closed)
and at other facilities that have continued to the present day. among the
identified risk factors, the following were amenable to modifications in colony
management: (a) early life stress exposure, (b) length of individual cage housing,
and (c) number of veterinary/experimental procedures. for example, nursery
rearing had been a very common strategy for handling infant monkeys at nerpc
in the early 1990s. this practice was discontinued except for instances of

 

 

  

 

and (c) number of veterinary/experimental procedures. for example, nursery
rearing had been a very common strategy for handling infant monkeys at nerpc
in the early 1990s. this practice was discontinued except for instances of
maternal neglect or low birth weight. neprc also re-examined the age at which
young animals were placed on research protocols. at the same time, there was a
concerted effort at all primate facilities to pair-house research monkeys and
reduce the number of animals housed in individual cages. although not all pairs
are compatible, high rates of success were documented at one facility, yielding
ately an 80% success rate for monkeys placed in same-sex pairings
(macallister et al., 2020). a similar rate of success at another facility occurred
when females were paired with vasectomized males (ekanayake-alper et al.,
2018).

 

 

finally, increasing emphasis was placed on the use of the positive reinforcement
training (prt) for basic husbandry procedures that involved moving animals to
new locations (fernstrém et al., 2009; veeder et al., 2009) or having animals sit at
individual stations when housed in social groups (kemp et al., 2017). additionally,
prt was extended to research procedures including blood sampling (coleman et
al., 2008; graham et al., 2012), saliva sampling (lutz et al., 2000), and urine
collection (bloomsmith et al., 2015). with respect to veterinary care and
monitoring, chimpanzees have been trained to cooperate with blood glucose
monitoring (reamer et al., 2014), acupuncture therapy (magden et al., 2013), and
physical therapy (neal webb et al., 2020).

4 conclusions and future directions

today, biomedical research programs are designed with an important focus on
the animals themselves, using procedures that involve cooperation and training
(eg, graham et al., 2012) and extensive monitoring of health and behavior
(gottlieb, coleman, et al., 2013). additionally, colony management practices are
routinely reviewed to determine best practices in improving the quality of life of
captive primates (gottlieb, coleman, et al., 2013). we are confident that these
efforts have improved the health and well-being of the animals compared to past
practices. yet, until the appropriate systematic studies are performed and the
results disseminated, we cannot know whether these changes have been
sufficient to completely prevent the development of sib in laboratory housed
rhesus monkeys.

although this article has focused specifically on sib as one particular behavioral
pathology in nonhuman primates, the recognition that changes in colony
management practices helped reduce this pathology raises the broader question
of how to continue improving the psychological well-being of these animals.
despite significant progress over the past two decades, much still needs to be

management practices helped reduce this pathology raises the broader question
of how to continue improving the psychological well-being of these animals.
despite significant progress over the past two decades, much still needs to be
done in terms of creating more optimal environments for laboratory primates
(coleman & novak, 2017). most environmental enrichment efforts have focused
on the inside of a cage (e.g., toys, foraging devices) and considerably less
attention has been paid to the broader environment. many of the animals remain
housed in stainless steel cages in rooms with barren white walls. often the only
stimuli outside the monkeys’ cages are a single computer monitor that not all
monkeys can see, or are interested in, along with the relatively brief presence of
animal care staff (2-3 times per day) for routine cleaning and feeding. perhaps we
should think in novel ways to make the overall laboratory environment less static
and more dynamic. this could involve, for example, introducing natural habitat
videos or slides of nature scenes projected onto those walls as a way to reduce
stress. in humans, considerable evidence supports the view that positive
distraction in the form of nature scenes can mitigate stress. for example, children
hospitalized briefly for at least 48 h showed significant reductions in hr and
systolic blood pressure when they were housed in rooms containing nature
murals in the windows as compared to children who were exposed to a window-
only control condition (pearson et al., 2019).

 

we should also consider changing the stainless steel cage by adding plastic
perches and furniture, replacing slotted floors with solid floors, and changing

only control conaition (pearson et al., 2019).

we should also consider changing the stainless steel cage by adding plastic
perches and furniture, replacing slotted floors with solid floors, and changing
some of the housing environment from stainless steel to wood as noted on the
nc3rs website at https://www.nc3rs.org.uk/macaques/captive-
management/housing/. these are suggestions that will require evaluation to
determine efficacy. however, our goal should always be to continue our efforts to
create an optimal laboratory environment. such efforts should lead to improved
monkey well-being and benefit the research enterprise.

3.1.2 pharmacotherapy

significant success in treating sib has been reported for pharmacotherapy,
although none of the drugs tested thus far has completely eliminated biting
behavior. the typical outcome in drug studies has been a 50% reduction in self-
biting rate. moreover, efficacy has to be viewed in the context of potential risks to
health and well-being of long-term drug treatment. depending on the drug, the
risks to rhesus monkeys include sedation or other adverse side effects,
development of tolerance requiring dose escalation, withdrawal symptoms upon
dose reduction, and increased risk of developing another disorder. individual
differences in drug response are difficult to predict and manage, and relapse (a
reappearance of sib) is always possible following termination of the treatment. in
all cases, animals on drug treatment protocols must be continuously monitored
and dosages adjusted when necessary. over the past 20 years, drugs targeting
the opioidergic, serotonergic, and adrenergic neurotransmitter systems have
been tested for their efficacy in treating sib in rhesus monkeys, each with its own
strengths and limitations.

suenguis anu miauurs:

at present, drugs that affect the opioid system appear to be most beneficial in
reducing sib. administration of the long-acting opioid receptor antagonist,
naltrexone, reduced biting behavior by about 50%, and this effect persisted at a
follow-up observation period conducted 110-200 days after treatment ended
(kempf et al., 2012). in subsequent investigations, naltrexone treatment also
reversed atrophy of white matter astrocytes and decreased the immune
activation that had been associated with sib (lee et al., 2013, 2015).

 

selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) have also shown some efficacy in
controlling episodes of sib in rhesus monkeys. beneficial effects were observed
for both the ssri, fluoxetine and the 5-ht1a receptor agonist, buspirone, yielding
on average a 50% reduction in biting behavior (fontenot et al., 2005). although
reductions in behavior persisted in a posttreatment period, the length (2 weeks)
was insufficient to assess long-term relapse. in a second study, fluoxetine was
more effective in ameliorating biting behavior than venlafaxine (a combined ssri
and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor), but the treated monkeys were not tested
for relapse (fontenot et al., 2009). serotonergic activity can also be manipulated
by adding the precursor l-tryptophan to the diet. in rhesus monkeys, biting
behavior decreased by over 75% during l-tryptophan administration, but the
monkeys relapsed once the dietary supplementation ended (weld et al., 1998).

guanfacine, an adrenergic a2a-receptor agonist, has been used to treat s|

  
  

monkeys relapsed once the

ary supplementation ended (weld et al., 1998).

    

guanfacine, an adrenergic a2a-receptor agonist, has been used to treat sib in
macaques and baboons. self-biting behavior in two rhesus monkeys and one
baboon was eliminated by administration of guanfacine; however, all animals
relapsed following the cessation of treatment (macy et al., 2000). a wound scoring
scale was used in a second study to evaluate the efficacy of guanfacine on sib in
rhesus macaques on wound size (freeman et al., 2015). treatment reduced the
severity of inflicted wounds but did not completely eliminate wounding events. as
with naltrexone, the effects of gaunfacine lasted far beyond the treatment period
(21 weeks) after which the monkeys relapsed.

 

in the past, the indirect gaba receptor agonist diazepam was commonly chosen
by veterinarians to treat acute episodes of sib in monkeys, based on its anxiolytic
properties and its “calming effect” (calcaterra & barrow, 2014). however, when we
examined the effects of diazepam treatment on eight monkeys at neprc that had
been referred to the veterinary staff because of wounding episodes, only four
showed a reduction in sib and the remaining monkeys actually got worse
(tiefenbacher, fahey, et al., 2005). thus, there may be risk in using diazepam as a
treatment for sib.

the above findings revealed that no treatment, whether environmental or
pharmacological, was completely effective in eliminating sib in rhesus monkeys.

riting hahauiar wine radiicad hit in a mainrihy af tha caene tha animale ralancad
other forms of environmental enrichment also failed as a treatment option. sib
was not reduced in monkeys given access to objects and foraging devices
(rommeck et al., 2009), puzzle feeders (novak et al., 1998), or play cages (griffis et
al., 2013). thus, even though environmental enrichment is extremely valuable for
increasing species-typical behavior and reducing stereotypic behavior, it may be
less useful as a therapeutic intervention for sib.

 

social housing appears to show some efficacy in reducing sib. however, once
again the information is limited, resting largely on two studies. moving monkeys
from individual indoor cages to outdoor enclosures with social companions
produced a marked reduction in sib (fontenot et al., 2006). additionally, pairings
with females led to reductions in sib in six individually housed adult male rhesus
monkeys who had been vasectomized before pairing (weed et al., 2003). on the
other hand, our own attempts to pair-house the neprc cohort of male rhesus
monkeys were unsuccessful because of their heightened aggressiveness (novak,
unpublished data).

3.1.1 environmental modifications

environmental enrichment and social housing are considered the first line of
defense in reducing abnormal behavior because they have a well-documented
track record in reducing stereotypic behavior in rhesus monkeys. however,
considerably less is known about whether these modifications actually mitigate
sib. we spent considerable time considering environmental modifications for the
neprc cohort, and our best strategy in the 1990s was sequestering these
monkeys in rooms with spacious cages, with low animal densities, and with a
vigorous and tailored program of environmental enrichment. as noted above, this
approach largely eliminated wounding but did not substantially alter noninjurious
biting behavior. over the years, we expanded our enrichment program to
included voluntary participation by the monkeys on mentally stimulating
challenges involving object permanence (de blois et al., 1999) and tool-using

tasks, for which they received fruit or vegetable treats. one tool-using task

included voluntary participation by the monkeys on mentally stimulating
challenges involving object permanence (de blois et al., 1999) and tool-using
tasks, for which they received fruit or vegetable treats. one tool-using task
required monkeys to insert a rod into a clear stationary plexiglas tube to extract a
treat. one monkey in figure 4 extended this task to portable tubes and was able
to extract the carrot. monkeys were also exposed to programmed games on the
ipad. most monkeys participated, even though the individual responses were
highly variable ranging from 10 to 472 touches per 10-min period (see figure 5).
despite participation in these various tasks, episodes of noninjurious biting were
not significantly reduced in these monkeys.

these findings have limitations. the data were collected on a single, relatively
small population of macaques housed at one facility. additionally, the data
derived from single-gene studies can be difficult to interpret. this is not surprising
as behavioral phenomena such as sib most likely result from multiple genes
working together in conjunction with exposure to challenging environments (i.e.,
gene by environment interactions). these findings also support a link between sib
and stress because both gene polymorphisms were also associated with lower
cortisol concentrations in response to the acute stress of blood sampling.

2.5.3 contributory risk factors and stress

an examination of health and colony management records was conducted not
only to determine the factors that may have contributed to the abnormal
behavior, but also to develop prevention strategies that might reduce the risk to
other animals in the future. several important risk factors in the etiology of sib
emerged from statistical surveys and were congruent across primate centers.
early rearing history proved to be a reliable predictor of sib. data from five
different primate facilities showed that nursery-reared monkeys were more likely
to develop sib than their mother-reared counterparts (bellanca & crockett;
gottlieb, coleman, et al., 2013; lutz, well, et al., 2003; lutz et al., 2007; rommeck
et al,, 2009). additionally, this adverse early experience was also associated with a
dysregulation of the hpa axis, one of the physiological markers of stress
exposure (capitanio et al., 2005; feng et al., 2011). however, to put these findings

et al., 2009). additionally, this adverse early experience was also associated with a
dysregulation of the hpa axis, one of the physiological markers of stress
exposure (capitanio et al., 2005; feng et al., 2011). however, to put these findings
in perspective, only a small percentage of nursery-reared monkeys ever
developed sib. in one study, noteworthy because of the large sample size,
prevalence of sib in nursery-reared monkeys was 23/164 (14.0%) as compared to
the prevalence in maternally-reared monkeys 2/181 (1.1%) (lutz et al., 2007).
thus, nursery-rearing, by itself, could not be the primary explanation for the
development of sib, inasmuch as 86% of nursery-reared monkeys never
developed the disorder. these findings suggested that other factors must have
been present that interacted with nursery rearing to produce the negative
behavioral outcome.

importantly, mother-reared monkeys can also develop sib. most of the monkeys
with sib in the nerprc population were mother-reared, as were the controls.
however, in our study cohort, sib was predicted by a different early life stress
event. specifically, monkeys that acquired the disorder were placed on research
protocols requiring individual cage housing as juveniles (average age 14 months),
whereas the control monkeys went on research protocols considerably later as
adolescents (average 36 months). this finding suggests that an increased risk for
sib can result from different kinds of adverse early experiences, of which nursery
rearing and early individual cage housing are but two examples.

2.5.4 variable risk factors

two other risk factors identified at neprc, the washington national primate
center, and the california national primate research center were associated with
the development of sib. the odds of developing sib increased as a function of the
number of years monkeys were individually housed (gottlieb, coleman, et al.,
2013, lutz, well, et al., 2003, rommeck et al., 2009) and as a function of the
number of blood draws and other procedures they experienced (gottlieb,
coleman, et al., 2013; lutz, well, et al., 2003). additionally, gottlieb, capitanio, et
al. (2013) showed that monkeys maintained in the lower racks of dual-level cages
were much more likely to develop sib than monkeys maintained in the upper
racks.

2.6 working model of sib in the nerprc cohort

our findings from the intensively studied cohort of monkeys at neprc revealed
one common pathway to sib involving exposure to an early life stressor (either
peer rearing in a nursery or early placement on research protocols req
individual cage housing) combined with genetic vulnerability as reflected in
polymorphisms of the mu-opioid receptor gene and regulatory polymorphisms of
the tph-2 gene. both had to be present, inasmuch as an early life stress event

individual cage housing) combined with genetic vulnerability as reflected in
polymorphisms of the mu-opioid receptor gene and regulatory polymorphisms of
the tph-2 gene. both had to be present, inasmuch as an early life stress event
without a genetic predisposition did not lead to sib. we also showed that sib was
part of a larger syndrome that included hpa axis dysregulation, sleep disruption,
perseverative behavior, and heightened aggressiveness.

3 resolving sib: treatment and
prevention

one of our greatest concerns was identifying effective strategies both to treat
monkeys with sib and to prevent other monkeys from acquiring the disorder.
treatment and prevention are not the same and are not necessary achieved by
the same strategies. furthermore, treatment efficacy can readily be assessed by
monitoring the change in sib. in contrast, prevention efficacy is dependent upon
identifying those factors that alter not only prevalence rates in a population but
deter the development of sib in monkeys longitudinally across a significant
period of their life. thus, prevention is more difficult to evaluate than treatment.

3.1 treatment

over the last two decades, there has been a concerted effort by many scientists
to identify treatments that might completely abolish sib. the search for
treatments is complicated by differing etiologies and developmental trajectories.
for example, different treatment approaches would be necessary for monkeys in
which sib (a) was related to an underlying medical condition, (b) had arisen as a
result of early life stress combined with genetic variation, or (c) had developed as.
a conditioned communicative response. additionally, individual differences in
temperament might affect the response to treatment. if the treatment involved
some form of environmental enrichment, individuals might react differently to
the same manipulation (izzo et al., 2011). as an example of these strong
individual differences to enrichment, we provided eight monkeys with access to
hammocks (otto environmental). three of the monkeys readily sat in the
hammocks and preferred them to their perches, using them both for sitting and
sleeping (see figure 3). the remaining five monkeys never used them even after
one year of exposure (novak, unpublished observations). in the discussion below,
we focus on the treatment of sib monkeys for which no underlying medical
condition is present.
this model suggests that some forms of abnormal behavior may be
communicative in nature. this idea is not new in the human literature. the
inadvertent reinforcement of sib by teachers was detected years ago in humans
with intellectual disabilities. a functional analysis of 145 episodes of sib revealed
that 38% were associated with deflecting teacher demands (social negative
reinforcement) and 26% were associated with gaining attention from teachers
(social positive reinforcement) (iwata et al., 1994).

can monkeys use postures and behavior in an attempt to communicate with
humans, either to attract their attention or conversely to stop them from
engaging in some activity? an emerging literature exists on human-monkey
interactions within a cognitive framework (see nougaret et al., 2019, for a review).
monkeys not only attend to human behavior, they can also quickly solve
problems by watching how humans solve them (falcone et al., 2012). additionally,
there is growing evidence that monkeys, both in captivity and in the wild, show
intentionality in their gestural communication with humans (canteloup et al.,
2015; deshpande et al., 2018). since care staff is trained to monitor self-biting
behavior and note it in the records, it is possible that some forms of abnormal
behavior in monkeys may be used to gain the attention of care staff.

 

evidence for this connection comes from pet animals and one case report in
baboons. in some dogs, owner-directed attention can reinforce circling behavior
and licking of unusual surfaces (hall et al., 2015). attention from staff also

evidence for this connection comes from pet animals and one case report in
baboons. in some dogs, owner-directed attention can reinforce circling behavior
and licking of unusual surfaces (hall et al., 2015). attention from staff also
appeared to be the inadvertent reinforcer of self-biting behavior in a zoo-housed
olive baboon. using functional analysis, dorey et al. (2009) demonstrated that sib
was contingent on attention from the care staff and was not associated with
other conditions such as demands to enter a crate. to alter this contingency, the
authors used differential reinforcement of alternative behavior (lipsmacking) with
extinction of attention to sib, a process that markedly reduced biting behavior.
these findings point to the possibility that some interactions between monkeys
and care staff may result in the use of abnormal behavior as a form of
communication. the extent to which abnormal behavior in monkeys might be
shaped by human behavior remains largely unknown, but we believe that it is.
unlikely to be a primary explanation for sib in rhesus monkeys.

2.5 etiology

although our initial efforts were designed to characterize sib in rhesus monkeys,
of equal importance was determining the causes of this behavior once medical
disease states had been ruled out. this effort entailed an in-depth examination of
colony management and health records of all past and current animals in the
facility to identify those factors that were associated with sib.

colony management and health records of all past and current animals in the
facility to identify those factors that were associated with sib.

2.5.1 causation versus risk

establishing strict causality was impossible because monkeys were identified only
after they acquired the disorder. however, it was still possible to identify potential
risk factors using a combination of genotyping and statistical analysis of
longitudinal health and colony management records of all monkeys in the
research population at neprc. the latter statistical approach also was used at
several other primate centers, thereby providing comparative databases.

risk factors are variables that increase the chances of developing sib (offord &
kraemer, 2000). risk factors may be fixed (e.g., genetic) whereas others may be
causal (eg., early rearing history) or variable (e.g., age of onset of a particular type
of housing). two assumptions are frequently made about the relationship
between risk factors and sib: (a) the risk factors are associated with increased
stress exposure and (b) they are psychogenic in origin. if accurate, we would
expect some association of these putative psychogenic stressors with
physiological measures of stress.

 

2.5.2 genetic factors

2.5.2 genetic factors

to date, the only published studies of the relationship between genetic
polymorphisms and sib were conducted on monkeys with and without sib
housed at neprc. we had previously determined that polymorphisms of the
serotonin transporter gene did not predict sib (tiefenbacher, fahey, et al., 2005).
however, other candidate genes showed more promise and were implicated in
some but not all of the features of sib in this population. a single-nucleotide
polymorphism of the mu-opioid receptor, in which the g77 variant showed a
much stronger affinity for b-endorphin than the c77 variant, was associated both
with heightened aggressiveness and lower plasma cortisol concentrations (miller
et al., 2004). however, no relationship to sib was detected, perhaps due to the
relatively low incidence of the g77 variant in our group of monkeys.
subsequently, regulatory polymorphisms of the tryptophan hydroxylase-2 (tph2)
gene were examined. tph2 is a rate-limiting enzyme expressed in serotonergic
neurons in the brain. the distribution of rhtph2 5'-fr haplotypes differed
significantly between monkeys with and without sib, and once again this genetic
difference was associated with lower plasma cortisol concentrations in response
to acute stress exposure (chen et al., 2010).

these findings have limitations. the data were collected on a single, relatively
small population of macaques housed at one facility. additionally, the data
derived from single-gene studies can be difficult to interpret. this is not surprising
behavior as self-injurious. however, in humans, the clinical characteristics of
nonsuicidal self-injury (nss!) appear to differ from body-focused repetitive
behaviors, such as hair pulling and skin picking (mathew et al., 2020).

in our colony and at least one other, male macaques appeared to be more
vulnerable to sib than females (gottlieb, coleman, et al., 2013; lutz, well, et al.,
2003, but see lutz et al., 2007 for no sex difference). this bias was in marked
contrast to a meta-analysis supporting a strong female bias in humans with nssi
(bresin & schoenleber, 2015). at neprc, the male bias may have resulted from
differential research allocation. in the 1990s, males were typically assigned to
research projects and housed individually, whereas females were assigned to the
breeding program. in support of this hypothesis, a later examination of biting-
only monkeys at the washington national primate center revealed 10 males and
20 females with sib out of a much larger total population of about 400 monkeys
(peterson et al., 2017).

2.2 associated conditions

in our next step, we evaluated sib and control monkeys to determine if there
were other underlying features to this disorder. this was based on the
assumption that abnormal behavior does not occur in a vacuum and that other
features should be anticipated. was sib a consequence of some underlying
disease state such as arthritis? was it related to differences in temperament, or
increased exposure to stress?

2.2.1 medical rule outs

during the early years of our research, physical health was always considered as
a possible explanation for sib. all monkeys were screened for clinical disease
using standard blood chemistry profiles and physical exams. additionally, biting
areas were x-rayed for signs of degenerative arthritis or other physical conditions.
we found no evidence of any underlying disease state. but at the time (1990s), we
really did not know what we were looking for. today, an emerging literature in
both monkeys and pet animals has pointed to the role of clinical disease and
genetic anomalies in some cases of sib and other forms of abnormal behavior.
thus, medical causes may be more common than previously thought in
mediating the expression of abnormal behavior.

 

 

several clinical conditions have been associated with sib. these include, but are
not limited to, arthritis, viral infections, and inherited/congenital defects. these
associations are based largely on clinical case reports. in one of our monkeys,
biting behavior developed suddenly in response to osteoarthritic changes in the
spine, manifested by lameness in one limb. treatment with meloxicam and
gabapentin improved locomotion and eliminated the biting behavior directed to

 

   

biting behavior developed suddenly in response to osteoarthritic changes in the
spine, manifested by lameness in one limb. treatment with meloxicam and
gabapentin improved locomotion and eliminated the biting behavior directed to
that limb (novak, unpublished observations in 2017). one monkey also developed
biting behavior as a result of shigella-induced reactive arthritis which was
alleviated with a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication (urvater et al., 2000).
in yet another case report, a monkey infected with simian immunodeficiency
virus developed severe skin lesions caused by scratching. a necropsy showed the
source of the neuropathic pain as cytomegalovirus infection (clemmons et al.,
2015).

 

lastly, inherited disorders and congenital defects appear to underlie the
expression of abnormal behavior in some animals. in a recent study, eye-poking
behavior in some monkeys was associated with achromatopsia, an inherited
retinal condition characterized by an absence of color vision and increased
sensitivity to light (moshiri et al., 2019). in another case report, severe sib in a
pigtailed macaque appeared to result from a congenital mitochondrial defect
leading to neocortical changes that included neuronal loss, gliosis, demyelination,
and extra-cerebral lesions (bielefeldt-ohmann et al., 2004). the above studies
suggest that disease or genetic anomalies may underlie the expression of
abnormal behavior in some instances. the actual percentage of cases explained
by medical conditions remains unknown at this time, but clinical conditions, like
those described above, are now receiving more attention and should be part of a

abnormal behavior in some instances. the actual percentage of cases explained
by medical conditions remains unknown at this time, but clinical conditions, like
those described above, are now receiving more attention and should be part of a
screening process for monkeys with severe forms of abnormal behavior.

2.2.2 correlated variables

after eliminating some basic clinical disease states in our monkeys, we sought to
determine whether sib was part of a larger syndrome. to be considered as a
feature of a syndrome, correlated conditions had to be present in a majority of
monkeys with sib but not in normally behaving monkeys. identifying these
conditions could play a pivotal role in finding effective treatments.

 

initially, our focus was on anxious temperament, a trait-like phenotype (fox et al.,
2008) associated with reduced central serotonergic activity and with the short
allele of the serotonin transporter gene (lesch et al., 1996). however, our studies
failed to support the idea that monkeys with sib were more anxious than
controls. sib and control monkeys did not differ either in serotonergic activity
assessed by measuring cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of the serotonin
metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (tiefenbacher et al., 2000) or in the
prevalence of the short allele of the serotonin transporter gene (tiefenbacher,
newman, et al., 2005). consistent with the above findings, a fenfluramine
challenge test failed to support the hypothesis that monkeys with sib would show
reduced serotonergic activity comnared to controls (tiefenbacher. davenport. et

prevalence of the short allele of the serotonin transporter gene (lietenbacher,
newman, et al., 2005). consistent with the above findings, a fenfluramine
challenge test failed to support the hypothesis that monkeys with sib would show
reduced serotonergic activity compared to controls (tiefenbacher, davenport, et
al., 2003). later studies on a different population also failed to show a link
between sib and anxious behavior. monkeys with sib actually showed fewer signs
of anxious behavior during the human intruder test than monkeys without the
disorder (peterson et al., 2017).

 

our behavioral observations also indicated that monkeys with sib showed higher
rates of threatening and cage shaking behavior directed both to humans and
other animals in the room as compared to monkeys without this disorder. we
tested the hypothesis that sib was a form of aggressive behavior occurring in
contexts in which actual physical contact between two monkeys was prevented by
the cage environment. however, once again our data failed to confirm this
hypothesis. in situations where aggressive behavior increased when an unfamiliar
monkey in a separate cage was added to a room environment, a typical colony
management procedure, there was no corresponding increase in self-biting
behavior (lutz, marinus, et al., 2003).

stress exposure has been linked to the development of abnormal behavior
(novak et al., 2013). stress is frequently assessed by measuring cortisol, the
peripheral output of activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (hpa)
axis. at the present time, cortisol output can be measured chronically using hair

(novak et al., 2013). stress is frequently assessed by measuring cortisol, the
peripheral output of activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (hpa)
axis. at the present time, cortisol output can be measured chronically using hair
samples, over the short-term in urine and feces, and acutely in blood and saliva
(novak et al., 2017). but in the 1990s, the standard approach was to measure
cortisol in the blood. we predicted that monkeys with sib would have higher
concentrations of cortisol in the blood than controls. indeed, hpa axis activity was
altered in monkeys with sib, but much to our surprise, it was in the opposite
direction. monkeys with sib had significantly lower levels of plasma cortisol than
controls (tiefenbacher et al., 2000). at that time, we considered two possible
explanations for this effect: monkeys with sib might have a lower basal level or
might show a blunted response to an acute stressor compared to controls. the
second idea seemed more likely, inasmuch as blood sampling in the 1990s
entailed the acute stress of cage restraint and sedation, a routine procedure also
associated with health exams. although we were careful to minimize the time
between restraint and sedation, it is probable that this procedure briefly activated
the monkeys’ stress response system. the failure to find differences in 24-h basal
urinary free cortisol concentrations was also suggestive of a blunted response to
the acute stressor of blood sampling (tiefenbacher, novak, et al., 2004). shortly
thereafter, we developed an assay to assess chronic levels of cortisol by
measuring it in hair (davenport et al., 2008) and discovered that monkeys with sib

thereafter, we developed an assay to assess chronic levels of cortisol by
measuring it in hair (davenport et al., 2008) and discovered that monkeys with sib
were more likely to show chronically elevated hair cortisol concentrations when
compared to controls. one of the outcomes of chronic stress exposure is a
reduced capability of the hpa axis to respond to acute stressors (herman et al.,
2016), thus providing an explanation for the blunted plasma cortisol
concentrations to the acute stress of blood sampling in our monkeys with sib.
these findings of a blunted stress response to an acute stressor are also
congruent with an emerging literature in humans with nssi (kaess et al., 2012;
klimes-dougan et al., 2019).

subsequently, other correlations emerged. monkeys with sib showed more
activity at night than controls (davenport et al., 2008). we replicated these
findings in a different population of monkeys with and without sib using
nighttime surveillance software, which allowed for more detailed measurements.
in this population, sib monkeys also showed higher overall activity at night than
controls. importantly, they showed delayed sleep onset and longer bouts of
activity when awake (stanwicks et al., 2017).

development of sib. of particular interest are astrocytes, a type of glial cell that is
involved in numerous central nervous system functions including glutamate ion
and water homeostasis, maintenance of the blood-brain barrier, and metabolism
at synapses. several years ago, scientists at the tulane national primate research
center discovered significant astrocyte atrophy and heightened immune
activation in sib but not control monkeys (lee et al., 2013). the authors had
previously shown that the opioid antagonist, naltrexone, was effective in reducing
sib in their monkeys (kempf et al., 2012). naltrexone was also effective in
reversing the changes in astrocyte morphology and immunity in monkeys with
sib (lee et al., 2015).

  

the findings in this section, based largely on a single small population of monkeys
at neprc, revealed that sib was not an entity unto itself. rather, sib was
correlated with other conditions, including but not limited to, dysregulation of the
stress response system, heightened aggressiveness, sleep disruption, and in the
tulane national primate research center, atrophy of glial cells and immune
dysfunction. however, because monkeys with sib were identified after they
developed the condition, we were unable to determine the extent to which these
factors interacted to influence biting behavior or the sequence in which these
conditions initially appeared in these animals. additionally, the challenges we
raised at the beginning of this article also pertain here. it is unlikely that monkeys
with sib housed either within or across different primate facilities would

with sib housed either within or across different primate facilities would
necessarily share all of these features because of individual differences in
temperament, health history, housing history, and research experience.

 

2.3 triggering events

compared to species-typical behaviors such as eating, drinking, watching,
locomoting, manipulating objects, and threatening other monkeys, episodes of
sib were very infrequent over the course of the day. this led us to ask whether
there were specific external events that might trigger these seemingly
spontaneous episodes. we used both behavioral observations and care staff
questionnaires to identify such events. we initially examined basic colony
management practices and their effect on biting behavior. behavioral
observations of monkeys across the day revealed some relationship to care staff
activities, with biting being highest in the morning during the events of cage
cleaning and food provisioning, lowest at noon when the care staff was at lunch,
and moderate in the afternoon during food provisioning (novak, 2003). however,
general activity in these monkeys also covaried with the presence of care staff,
making it difficult to distinguish whether the changes in biting behavior were
directly due to staff activity or to circadian variations in behavior induced by a
highly predictable food provisioning schedule.

we expanded our effort to include all animals in the research population at
neprc. we surveyed care staff and technicians across the center and asked them
to identify the situations in which they observed sib. there were widely varying
responses, including a large number of indeterminate cases. however, relocation
was identified as a factor of concern. moving sib monkeys to another room
appeared to precipitate biting behavior in some, though not all monkeys with this
disorder. this effect was confirmed in a subsequent study. our population of sib
and control monkeys had to be relocated because of structural defects in the
building in which they were currently housed. care was taken to keep these
monkeys together and not mix them with monkeys on other projects. however,
we could not control the number of animals in a room, nor retain our spacious
housing environments. our monkeys were moved from five low-density rooms
(5-6 animals per room) to two high-density rooms (13 animals per room) and
housed in standard quad cages. despite our efforts to retain some common
features, monkeys with sib reacted adversely to the move, showing a marked
increase in biting behavior that persisted for more than a year (davenport et al.,
2008). fortunately, the main effect was restricted to the frequency of biting, since
only one of the sib monkeys produced a mild wound in the first month following
relocation. none of the control monkeys developed sib during the study,
indicating that relocation does not typically precipitate self-biting in animals

2.4 maintenance

in the past, abnormal behavior was viewed either as purposeless (e.g.,
stereotypies) or harmful (e.g., sib), and little attention was paid to the idea that
abnormal behavior in monkeys might be motivated by reinforcement
contingencies. today, abnormal behaviors, including sib, are thought to serve
some function and to persist because of their reinforcing value. human self-
report data indicate that nssi can serve many functions ranging from relieving
negative thoughts, regulating cascading emotions, and setting boundaries with
others (lloyd-richardson et al., 2007). in the case of nonhuman primates and
other mammals, three different models have been proposed to account for the
persistence of sib. two of these models share a common tenet, that sib may
mitigate the effects of adverse environmental conditions. the third model is
concerned with social communication. it posits that sib has developed
unintentionally through inadvertent reinforcement by veterinary animal care staff
and research technicians and other individuals who may have continuing contact
with these animals.

2.4.1 mitigating models

these models focus directly on the quality of the environment, albeit in very
different ways. in the tension/arousal-reduction model, sib arises in response to
a chaotic, overstimulating environment and serves to reduce tension (dellinger-
ness & handler, 2006). by contrast, the impoverishment model suggests that sib
provides sensory-perceptual stimulation in response to a static, unchanging
environment (mason & latham, 2004). from the standpoint of possible
treatments for sib, these models predict very different strategies, either reducing
the sources of environmental variation or adding substantial forms of
environmental enrichment. that both unstimulating and highly stimulating
environments might cause sib to develop is supported by studies conducted on
humans with nssi (edmondson et al., 2016; nederkoorn et al., 2016) and is
consistent with the idea that different developmental pathways can lead to this
disorder.

the tension reduction model has received relatively little attention in studies of
rhesus monkeys. in part, this is because the primary test of this model requires
identifying features of the environment that can be overstimulating to sib
monkeys, removing them, and observing a reduction in sib. given strong

 

 

     

rhesus monkeys. in part, this is because the primary test of this model requires
identifying features of the environment that can be overstimulating to sib
monkeys, removing them, and observing a reduction in sib. given strong
individual differences in how monkeys respond to their environment, the relevant
features might also vary by individual. additionally, stimulus removal could
eliminate various enrichment strategies, which would be counterproductive in an
era in which enrichment strategies are legally mandated. an alternative strategy
is to determine whether changes in arousal are associated with spontaneously
occurring biting episodes. many years ago, we examined basal heart rate (hr)
patterns in monkeys with sib and characterized the changes in hr that had
occurred immediately before, during, and immediately after spontaneous,
noninjurious biting episodes. we observed an elevation in hr for about 5—10 min
before and during a biting episode, followed by a return to basal hr shortly after
the episode (novak, 2003). although suggestive of possible tension reduction, this
finding was not pursued.

ina similar manner, we also attempted to determine if noninjurious biting
alleviated stress activation. we trained monkeys to chew on sweetened dental
ropes to provide saliva samples for cortisol assay (lutz et al., 2000). we waited for
a spontaneous biting episode to occur, often requiring hours of observation, and
collected saliva samples immediately after the episode, which reflected a 5—10-
min window before the biting episode, and then 15 min later, with corresponding
control samples collected on another day at the same time of day. if an unknown

collected saliva samples immediately after the episode, which reflected a 5—10-
min window before the biting episode, and then 15 min later, with corresponding
control samples collected on another day at the same time of day. if an unknown
stressor activated the stress response system and biting served to reduce that
stress, then cortisol concentrations before the biting episode were predicted to
be higher than postbiting concentrations. on nonbiting days, the two cortisol
concentrations were expected to be similar to each other. the results clearly
showed no mean difference between the two cortisol concentrations either on
biting or nonbiting days. this finding suggested that biting episodes were not
precipitated by an increase in hpa axis activity. indeed, our observers had
difficulty detecting any environmental event that precipitated an episode of self-
biting. but other possible explanations, related to the sample timing, must also be
considered. biting episodes are very short, on average less than 10 in length,
whereas hpa axis activation takes minutes to detect in saliva. it is possible that
the timing of our sample collections was not optimal to detect the hypothesized
change. we did not pursue this further because of the possibility that after two
trials, monkeys might come to associate biting behavior with chewing on a
sweetened dental rope.

the impoverishment model suggests that barren environments can lead to the
negative state of boredom, and in this context, sib serves as a form of self-
stimulation to overcome the boredom. however, this model is very difficult to test

negative state of boredom, and in this context, sib serves as a form of self-
stimulation to overcome the boredom. however, this model is very difficult to test
in monkeys. currently, there is no procedure that would reliably identify
boredom, as distinct from other states such as inactivity or anxiety. additionally,
in this era of extensive environmental enrichment of the captive environment,
one would either have to modify the enrichment program to make the
environment barren (highly undesirable and risky to the animals themselves) and
then, after a period, reinstate the enrichment program. alternatively, one would
have to add additional enrichment to the existing enrichment program. although
certain types of enrichment can have substantial effects on some forms of
abnormal behavior (gottlieb et al., 2015), its effects on sib are much more
variable. for example, providing daily access to food puzzle feeders, above and
beyond the standard enrichment program, did not reduce sib in monkeys with
this condition, despite their high rates of manipulating the feeder (novak et al.,
1998). on the other hand, moving singly housed monkeys to outdoor pens was
associated with a reduction in self-biting behavior, but not wounding (fontenot et
al., 2006).

2.4.2 social communication model

this model suggests that some forms of abnormal behavior may be
communicative in nature. this idea is not new in the human literature. the
inadvertent reinforcement of sib by teachers was detected years ago in humans
this procedure reduced the severity of the self-biting behavior, thereby largely
eliminating wounding. however, it did not eliminate the behavior. by examining
the skin for recent abrasions at biting target sites, we failed to see abrasions and
determined that the behavior was now primarily noninjurious (novak, 2003). in
that sense, our changes produced benefits, and during routine health exams, we
continued to track changes in the skin. nonetheless, because the persistence of
self-biting still had the potential to lead to wounding both in our cohort and
among other monkeys at the facility, we decided that a more comprehensive
strategy was needed to solve this problem. a series of questions were devised,
the answers to which were expected to impact both treatment and prevention.

the comprehensive plan involved interdependent levels of analysis. these levels
started with characterization of the disorder. what was the form and prevalence
of sib? what were the typical environments? were males more vulnerable than
females? the next level involved an examination of each individual monkey for
the presence of other associated conditions. was sib the result of some underlying

of sib? what were the typical environments? were males more vulnerable than
females? the next level involved an examination of each individual monkey for
the presence of other associated conditions. was sib the result of some underlying
disease? was it related to anxiety? was it related to stress? a third level was
concerned with triggering events. what events appeared to precipitate a biting
episode or increase the intensity and frequency of biting in monkeys that had the
disorder? the next level was maintenance. what were the reinforcement
contingencies that caused the behavior to persist? all of the above levels required
extensive observations of behaving animals and we expected that the
information gleaned would be useful in a therapeutic context. by contrast in the
next level, etiology, we focused on the longitudinal evaluation of many animals
derived from health and colony management records. what were the
genetic/environmental risk factors that increased vulnerability to sib? the
answers at this level were expected to impact both treatment and prevention.
ideally, if we could alter breeding strategies and reduce or remove environmental
risks, we should minimize the odds that monkeys would develop sib. with all this
information at hand, we then describe the efficacy of various treatments and
prevention and strategies.

2.1 characterization

behavioral samples collected on all research monkeys at nerprc were used to
characterize the various forms of abnormal behavior, including sib (lutz, well, et
al., 2003). in the neprc population, sib generally consisted of bites directed to
the limbs that occasionally resulted in wounds in some animals. before 2005, a
survey of colony health records revealed that the prevalence of monkeys with a
wounding history at neprc was 11% of the total research population (novak,
2003). this rate was slightly lower than at other facilities: 15% of rhesus
macaques at an nih facility (bayne et al., 1995) and 15% of pigtailed macaques
housed at the washington national primate research center (bellanca &
crockett, 2002).

in a historical review of wounding histories at the neprc, the average incidence
rate in individual monkeys was quite low, with the median number of wounding
events in a 5-year period being less than two occurrences (novak, 2003).
additionally, at this same facility, we detected a second type of sib from our
behavioral observations. this second group comprised monkeys that engaged in
biting behavior, but never produced wounds, and therefore, were not identified in
the colony health records. thus, the overall prevalence of monkeys who engaged
in any form of self-biting behavior at neprc was 25%, but only 11% of those
monkeys had a veterinary record of wounding (lutz, well, et al., 2003).

younger than monkeys that wounded themselves, but a 5-vear assessment

subsequent evaluation of biting-only monkeys revealed that biters were slightly
younger than monkeys that wounded themselves, but a 5-year assessment
period revealed no systematic evidence that biters progressed to wounding
(novak, unpublished data).

in the past, sib was attributed solely to housing monkeys in laboratory
environments. however, this view proved to be inaccurate, because sib was also
identified in nonhuman primates housed in enriched zoo settings (hosey &
skyner, 2007) and, more importantly, in monkeys living in free-ranging
environments. grewal (1981) observed six monkeys, in a troop of 100 wild-living
japanese macaques, who bit their wrists, one of the common target sites of the
neprc monkeys as well. it remained unknown whether these wrist bites in the
japanese macaques resulted in any wounds. more recently, a type of sib was.
identified in free-ranging baboons who had sustained wounds, on average once a
month, from fights with other males. an examination of the process of wound
healing revealed that recovery was delayed in some monkeys because of scab
picking (taniguchi & matsumoto-oda, 2018). as the authors note, excessive scab
picking worsened their wounds, as a result of which they characterized the
behavior as self-injurious. however, in humans, the clinical characteristics of
nonsuicidal self-injury (nss!) appear to differ from body-focused repetitive
behaviors, such as hair pulling and skin picking (mathew et al., 2020).

we started working with 16 male monkeys with sib and 10 control males without
this condition at the neprc. initially, we focused on treatment and tried many
strategies to reduce this behavior, without much success. these included
enrichment of the environment (novak et al., 1998), social housing, and larger
cage environments (kaufman et al., 2004). the monkeys were subsequently
sequestered in a separate building and housed either in dog runs, large baboon
cages, or large pens (see figure 1), with no more than 6-8 monkeys per room. we
implemented a vigorous enrichment program, partially tailored to their individual
preferences (see figure 2).
1 introduction

some monkeys housed in research facilities develop abnormal behavior. these
patterns vary both in frequency and severity, ranging from mild forms of pacing,
occurring primarily in anticipation of food provision, to more serious forms of
behavior, manifested by self-directed biting and high rates of hair-pulling
behavior (novak et al., 2012). there has been a concerted effort to understand
how and why monkeys engage in self-injurious behavior (sib) and more

behavior, manifested by self-directed biting and high rates of hair-pulling
behavior (novak et al., 2012). there has been a concerted effort to understand
how and why monkeys engage in self-injurious behavior (sib) and more
importantly why only a small percentage of monkeys, with seemingly similar
housing and background, develop this disorder (lutz, well, et al., 2003). although
the laboratory environment might play some role, it cannot be the sole cause of
sib, because most laboratory housed monkeys never develop this pathology.

1.1 challenges

much of our research over the last two decades has been devoted to studying sib
in rhesus monkeys with the goal of determining effective treatment and
prevention strategies. although our initial attempts to resolve this problem relied
on standard approaches, it quickly became clear that the typical approach
developed late in the 20th century (e.g., modifications of the cage environment)
was simply not adequate for the task. it is now evident that ameliorating
abnormal behavior in monkeys is impacted by two issues. the first is the
presence of strong individual differences in how monkeys respond to their
environment. these differences have been linked with variations in functional
brain connectivity (xu et al., 2019), genetic factors (driscoll et al., 2017), inherited
disorders (moshiri et al., 2019), personality traits (altschul et al., 2016; bliss-
moreau & moadab, 2016), spontaneously arising clinical disease conditions
(urvater et al., 2000; wu et al., 2020), and previous experiences (dettmer et al,

 

disorders (moshiri et al., 2019), personality traits (altschul et al., 2016; bliss-
moreau & moadab, 2016), spontaneously arising clinical disease conditions
(urvater et al., 2000; wu et al., 2020), and previous experiences (dettmer et al,
2012; morin et al., 2019). thus, it should come as no surprise that some of these
individual differences also influence vulnerability to sib (bauer & baker, 2016;
gottlieb, capitanio, et al., 2013; lutz, well, et al., 2003) and impact the response to
treatment (baker et al., 2009; tiefenbacher, fahey, et al., 2005).

a further complication is that individual monkeys with sib do not necessarily
share all the possible factors that might contribute to their condition. thus, the
second issue involves different etiologies and developmental trajectories. as we
shall show, there can be many pathways that lead to the outcome of sib. as
examples, pathways included monkeys that developed sib as a secondary
consequence of clinical illness (e.g., arthritis), monkeys for which sib consisted of
genetic vulnerability paired with psychological stress, and monkeys that used sib
as a form of communication to attract the attention of care staff (dorey et al.,
2009). these two issues made it challenging to design effective treatments that
worked for the majority of monkeys with sib, and currently, there is no single
treatment that resolves sib in all cases.

and from those discussions and observations of the monkeys, a new research
program emerged. it is important to note that these monkeys only came to the
attention of animal care staff after they acquired the disorder, meaning that this
condition was not experimentally induced. onset in monkeys was analogous to

some monkeys house’ ies develop abnormal behavior
ranging from stereotypic to the more serious condition of self-injurious
behavior (sib). we initially sought to understand how and why monkeys
engaged in sib and more importantly why only a small percentage of
laboratory monkeys, with seemingly similar housing and background,
developed this disorder. of particular importance was the recognition that
different pathways might lead to sib and that strong individual differences
would affect the manifestation of this disorder and the response to treatment.
we developed a comprehensive plan to identify effective treatment and
prevention strategies. we started with characterizing the disorder in terms of
prevalence and types of environments in which it was found. we then
conducted observations on a cohort of sib and control monkeys to identify
conditions associated with sib (e.g., disordered sleep) as well as clinical
disease states and congenital defects that could be precipitating factors. we
examined the environmental events that triggered episodes of sib in monkeys

reinforcement contingencies associated with sib, including tension reduction,
self-stimulation, and social communication. possible treatments for sib such
as environmental enrichment, social housing, and pharmacotherapy were
tested by our group and others. to date, no single treatment has been found
to abolish sib, and each of these treatments is impacted by individual
differences. to develop possible prevention strategies, we examined colony
management and health records to find risk factors for sib. these risk factors
generalized to other facilities, and considerable effort was expended by all
behavioral managers at these facilities to reduce early life stress exposure, to
minimize the length of individual cage housing by emphasizing pair housing,
and to reduce the possible stressfulness of various veterinary/medical
procedures by implementing positive reinforcement training.
