abstract -

the observation of forward proton scattering in association with lepton pairs (e*e~ + p or
u*u” + p) produced via photon fusion is presented. the scattered proton is detected by the
atlas forward proton spectrometer, while the leptons are reconstructed by the central
atlas detector. proton-proton collision data recorded in 2017 at a center-of-mass energy of
v/s = 13 tev are analyzed, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 14.6 fb~'. a total of
57 (123) candidates in the ee + p (uj + p) final state are selected, allowing the background-
only hypothesis to be rejected with a significance exceeding 5 standard deviations in each
channel. proton-tagging techniques are introduced for cross-section measurements in the
fiducial detector acceptance, corresponding to deezp = 11.0 + 2.6(stat) + 1.2(syst) + 0.3(lumi)
and oy+p = 7.2 1.6(stat) + 0.9(syst) + 0.2(lumi) fb in the dielectron and dimuon channel,
respectively.
