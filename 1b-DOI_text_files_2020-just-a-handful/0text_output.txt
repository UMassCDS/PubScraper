4.3.1. techniques based on antibodies

immunoassays are based on the extreme specificity and strong interaction of an
antibody with his antigen. the principles of immunoassays are like the ones used in
conventional methods such as elisa, where the presence of a “reporter” is required
to monitor minimal changes occurring on the presence of the target analyte. in 2014,
zen was detected on spiked and naturally contaminated feed samples through a
competitive assay using 4,4"-dipyridyl as a reporter and aunps as sers substrates.
the lod reached the picogram range (1 pg/ml) for zen standard solutions. on feed
samples, the extreme sensibility of the method required sample dilution before any
raman signals could be observed. (1104) in the following years, three works using
antibody-functionalized nanoparticles were developed to detect aflatoxins.
(92,119,120) two of these included nanoparticles with strong electromagnetic
properties to combine the steps of antigen capture and cleanup, using a magnet.

different approach was taken with the development of an on-site sers-based lateral
flow immunosensor for the monitoring of aflatoxin m1 (afm1) levels in urine.

the actual presence of aflatoxins in food and feed is not always accurately reflected,
regardless of the type of analytical method used, because of sampling and analysis
errors. (121,122) it is necessary to monitor the levels of this mycotoxin in the body to
determine the real exposure. afm1, which is an afb1 metabolite, concentrated in
serum (in the form of albumin-afm1 complexes) or in urine (as free afm1), is related
to afb1 intake, (123-125) making it suitable to track the real afb1 exposure. aunps
conjugated with afm1-bovine serum albumin (bsa) were immobilized on a
nitrocellulose membrane served as a lateral flow strip. the reporter molecule, 5,5-

4.3.2. techniques based on aptamers

aptamers are small oligonucleotides ligands, dna, rna, or peptides engineered to
bind a specific target with high affinity. these molecules are thermally more stable
than antibodies, because of their simplest structure. there is no risk of denaturation
under high temperatures, maintaining their structures over repeated cycles of
denaturation/renaturation. (126) aptamers can be easily modified to introduce signal
moieties or facilitate the linkage to a solid support, which makes them of extreme
interest for functionalizing sers substrates. almost all the studies applying aptamer-
based sers detection for mycotoxins were developed for ota, a few of them for
main directions, the first of which consisted of the adsorption of aptamer molecules

on au surfaces by thiol~alkane linkage to analyze the spectral variation after adding

monitoring the raman signal intensity of reporter molecules, whicn are well-known to
have strong and well-characterized raman activity. the simplest of these
experiments used mycotoxin aptamers labeled with a reporter molecule that can be
adsorbed on the surface of nanoparticles (127) or other supporting surfaces (98)
when there are no mycotoxins in the sample, giving strong sers signals from the
reporter. but the presence of the analyte prevents the adsorption from occurring and
this is translated to a reduction in the intensity of the reporter's raman signals. other
more sophisticated methods employed a complementary strand aptamer to improve
the affinity of the labeled-mycotoxin aptamers to the surface of the nanoparticles.
aptamersis the guarantee that the reduction in the signal intensity is due to the
presence of the mycotoxin and not a consequence of weak interaction between the
aptamer and the nanoparticles. the lod obtained using these methods can reach

the ranae of picoarams, even on real food samples. (102) li and co-workers (132)

4.3.3. techniques based on molecularly imprinted polymers (mips)

these stable polymers can mimic the function of biological receptors using a
template (target analyte) during their synthesis. the specificity of these polymers is
compared to one between an antibody and its antigen. in addition, mips can be
applied to recognize and capture low-molecular-weight analytes. (133,134) mips can
be synthesized directly on the surfaced of nanoparticles in the presence of the
template, a monomer, a cross-linker, and an initiator molecule and, as a result,
mips@nps will be obtained. using these substrates, mycotoxins such as pat, which
isa very small molecule, was detected with high performance using sers. (106)
mips has been developed for the recognition of other mycotoxins, don, ota, zen,
fb1, and trichothecene t-2, indicating a possible application in sers. (135-140)

reporter can be used to improve the accuracy of the quantification; (29) and a wide
number of nanostructures or a combination of them can be employed to magnify the
sers effects. (92,98,128,130) the selection of the type of substrate will be
dependent mainly on the scope of the study. if the main purpose is the applicability, it
is necessary to develop a rapid, sensitive, selective, reproducible method and will
require important monetary resources. on the other hand, if the purpose is to explore
the potential for sers to be used to study mycotoxins as fundamental research, the
use of noncomplex, less-expensive substrates might satisfy the requirements, but it
will need extensive data processing and analysis

expertise that the data analysis requires, along with a deep undl. c.g -
statistical concepts to process and interpret results or the limited application,
because of the difficulty to implement a quantitative methodology correctly validated

there are many alternative routes to take to elevate this technique to the group of
future analytical methods for mycotoxin detection

5.1. simplified sample pretreatments

one of sers's main characteristics is its simple sample pretreatment that is easily
ascertainable, since the samples do not need extensive cleanup steps subsequent to
the extraction, when compared to most of the aoac official methods of analysis. (2)
sers is compatible with the liquid-liquid extraction (lle) method, one of the most
traditional mycotoxin extraction methods, which is simple, affordable, and can be
adapted to different scales. (37) generally, lle extraction utilizes solubility properties

method and a quechers (quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, sare) system were
employed to extract ota from wine samples (100) and afb1 from wheat, corn, and
protein feed powders, (96) respectively. these simplified sample pretreatments can
integrate sampling, extraction, and concentration, while reducing sample handling
and using a lower volume of solvents. (37,141) another approach is solid-phase
extraction (spe), which uses the principle of chromatographic techniques employing
disposable cartridges packed with an analyte-bonding material to recognize and
separate the target analyte from the rest of the sample. several spe methods were
developed for the extraction of mycotoxins ota, afb1, fumonisins, aoh, and pat
from different food samples, however, one of the main disadvantages of this method
is that it requires specific conditions for each type of analyte, making it unlikely to find
a universal type of cartridge for mycotoxins. (37), quechers methods, on the other
hand, have been validated to extract 14 mycotoxins from different commodities for a

uhplc-ms/ms analysis (1.42) or up to 17 mycotoxins for detection using an lc-
acetonitrile coupled to a dispersive solid-phase extraction (d-st

5.2. in-situ mapping

spectral data can be collected from discrete sections of an area or volume and
integrated to generate artificial color images based on the intensity of a designated
peak. this approach, which is called the mapping technique, provides a better relative
standard deviation than a simple average of a few randomly chosen points. choo and
co-workers (151) developed a microarray platform to detect three mycotoxins: ota,
fb, and afb1. using an antibodies-based system, this group showed that sers
mapping facilitates the interpretation of the results without affecting the sensitivity
(figure 7). this method also allows the use of a larger quantity of samples, usually
meaning more-representative sampling. a large amount of liquid sample or diluted

mapping analysis is probably the possibility of directly analyzin
vegetables, fruits, or other food products (152,153) thus providi lz

5.3. sers combined with other techniques

sers can be combined with other techniques to complement their advantages and
to overcome their individual limitations. basically, sers detection capability will be
enhanced if it is combined with separation (tlc, hplc, etc.), colorimetric, labeling
techniques, or microfluidic devices. if sers is combined with other spectroscopic
techniques, ms, nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr), infrared spectroscopy (ir), or x-
ray spectroscopy (xr), the characterization capability will benefit greatly. (155) this
approach has been proven previously on the mycotoxin field, combining sers with
thin-layer chromatography (tlc) for on-site detection of afb1 from peanut samples,
which additionally, because of tlc high separation abilities, allowed the
differentiation of the three remaining types of aflatoxins: b2, g1, and g2. (156)
another example is the combination with fluorescence resonance energy transfer
effect (fret) for simultaneous detection of three mycotoxins (ota, zen, and fb1)
using this method, the spectra of the three different analytes showed clear

detection systems is one of the most promising approaches. t

the size and shape of the nanostructures, allowing highly reproducible quantitative
results. (159) the application of these devices in food matrixes is stil in its early
stage and a fast expansion in the research field is expected. integration with a smart
mobile device will open the possibility of the sers approach of reaching wider users
and applications. in fact, the development of a smartphone-based sers

a rapid response time when analyzing typical sers model molecules, rhodamine 6g

nanoparticles with irregular shapes and uniformly distributed on the surface of a
solid platform. the sers substrate was cauliflower-shaped aunps in an aao

simultaneous detection of afb1, ota, and zea in foodstuffs, (94) and afb1, ota,

colleagues (93) developed a triple test line lateral flow strip system that can be used

future trends for both, sers techniques and mycotoxin studies, are not limited to
their adaptation into the smart device's universe. the concept of deep learning and
artificial intelligence methods for raman and mycotoxin analysis is not new in either
of these fields. machine learning can be defined as a system capable of acquiring
knowledge by extracting features from raw data and then using this knowledge to
make decisions to tackle real-world problems. (1165) electronic nose and electronic
tongue have been already applied for rapid detection of toxigenic fungi and
mycotoxins. (166) ota/ctn-producing strains of penicillium verrucosum on bread

of studies using this type of substrate to detect mycotoxins. perhaps this is because
they can be costly, compared to colloid substrates, and they still lack the high
selectivity that functionalized nanostructure substrates offer. nevertheless, two
studies using bare solid surfaced-based substrates showed that sers can
differentiate between the four types of aflatoxins (b1, b2, g1, and g2). (84,95) the
first study, in 2012, employed an oblique angle vapor deposition technique to
fabricate a silver nanorods (agnrs) array. (84) in this technique, a thin layer of the
substrate initially deposited on a solid surface is rotated by a stepper motor in an
angle of >75°, in front of a vapor source that controls the growth of agnrs by a
shadowing effect and surface diffusion. pure solutions of the four types of aflatoxins
were added directly to the surface of these arrays and allowed to dry before
spectrum acquisitions. (115) combined with dft calculations, it was one of the first
studies to provide a detailed characterization of these mycotoxin spectra. similarly,

the practicality and cost will be dependent mostly on the chosen substrate synthesis
method and the further modifications that might be needed. a desirable sers
substrate should be reproducible, and signal enhancement must be homogeneous
across the surface or from batch-to-batch measurements. for commercial
applications, the sers substrate must have good stability to ensure an acceptable
shelf life. sers substrates can be divided into two groups: colloidal substrates and
solid surface-based substrates. both groups rely on the physical properties of
metallic nanostructures to enhance raman signals in their proximity but solid
surface-based substrates provide better control over the location of hot spots and
therefore enhance the reproducibility. metallic nanostructures without any surface
modification are called "bare or label-free nanoparticles” and, although single-
molecule detection can be achieved using these types of substrates, they cannot
isolate the target in complex samples such as food matrices. this is a significant

the simplest sers experiments use colloid substrates, mixing a known amount of
the analyte with a colloidal suspension of metallic nanoparticles (figure 2), such as
silver (ag) or gold (au) colloids, ranging in diameter from 10 nm to 200nm. ag and au
nanoparticles are arguably the most used substrates, because of their physical
properties, stability, low cost, and simple preparation. (87) silver in the form of
nanospheres, usually referred to as ag nanoparticles (agnps), was used to explore
the detection of citrinin (ctn), aflatoxins, don, and in the form of dendrites to detect
fb1. (82,83,88,89) lee and co-workers (82,83) detected aflatoxins and furnonisins in
maize samples, using a simple procedure that consisted of a solvent-mediated
extraction that followed a mixing with nanoparticle solutions. maize samples were

description of ctn spectra was obtained using agnps on the surface of hydrophobic
teflon films. unlike hydrophilic platforms, such as glass, where molecules dispersed
ina solution are free to diffuse over the surface, hydrophobic surfaces can
concentrate molecules into a smaller region, because of an effect known as the
hydrophobic condensation effect, forcing them to enter the “hot spot” areas and
thereby enhancing the intensity of sers signals. (112) using a different platform is
just one of the many ways to improve the raman enhancement factor, reproducibility,
and stability of the colloidal substrates. for example, when agnps were synthesized
under alkaline conditions, the computed analytical enhancement factor (aef)
improved (1.45 x 108, compared to 4.54 x 10” for neutral conditions (ph 7)), allowing
for the detection of ota and afb1 in spiked cocoa bean samples at very low lods
(0.00263 1g/kg and 0.00415 l1g/kg, respectively). (97), there is also an indication that

it was seen that other shapes of nanoparticles, such as nanorod, nanotriangles,
nanocubes, nanostars, and core-shells can generate higher raman enhancement
than spherical nanoparticles, because of the stronger plasmonic oscillation

improved by the addition of a coating agent to maintain the stability of the

the first use of sers for mycotoxin detection started at the beginning of this decade
and has been gradually increasing. in the last two years, the number of publications
has doubled from the previous five years, and this year has already seen more
publications than previous years. this increasing interest seems to correspond with
the availability of appropriate nanostructures for substrates, because of the progress
in nanotechnology. (85-87) the first step in establishing a new analytical method
usually starts with the testing of standard solutions, but the minimal sample
preparation that the sers technique requires facilitates rapid testing in real sample

the enhanced raman signals come mainly from the electromagnetic fields
originating from the interaction of light with metal surfaces. regions with highly
enhanced local electromagnetic fields are called “hot spots” and occur when
neighboring nanostructures interact with each other over distances in the order of
nanometers. (62) in addition to the electromagnetic mechanism, there is a chemical
mechanism that is dependent on the nature of each molecule and involves the
formation of new molecular states on molecules chemisorbed on a sers-active
surface. (63-65) thus, sers directly detects the target analyte in a way that is
molecularly specific, allowing identification without the need for extensive separation
in some cases, resulting in a rapid and nondestructive technique that is becoming
increasingly popular in a wide variety of fields including food quality and safety,

(25,26) and art and archeology. (27.78)

 
for regulatory compliance, effective analytical methods to detect and quantify these
mycotoxins are essential. the analysis of mycotoxins usually requires toxin
extraction from the matrix, a cleanup procedure to remove interfering elements, and
detection and quantification using appropriate analytical instrumentation. the most
common methods used for mycotoxin analysis are chromatographic systems
coupled with highly sensitive detection systems such as liquid chromatography (lc)
or high-performance liquid chromatography (hplc) coupled with fluorescence (fl),
ultraviolet (uv), or mass spectrometry (ms) detectors. (2,36-38) the high resolution

fundamentals to develop simple, rapid, and convenient systems for mycotoxin
analysis. (39-53) despite their simplicity major drawbacks for these types of tests
are the possibility of cross-reactivity and a high matrix dependence that reduces
accuracy. in addition, there are high costs associated with development and
commercial use. (40,54)

 

other technologies were developed for the analysis of mycotoxins in the research
field but with limited commercial applications, since they require further verification
and validation by the recognized organizations. molecular and genomic methods
such fluorescent in situ hybridization (fish), dna barcoding, or polymerase chain
reaction (pcr), are highly effective in identifying the presence of mycotoxigenic fungi
but do not quantify the amount of mycotoxin produced. approaches such as the

phytopathogenic fungi can invade crops in the field or during storage and can
produce a large and growing family of low-molecular-weight molecules called
mycotoxins that can accumulate in food or feed in toxicologically relevant
concentrations. there are over 400 compounds recognized as mycotoxins so far,
with this number increasing over the years, because of the capability of more-
specialized analytical tools and the increasing number of fungi being isolated. in
terms of public health and agroeconomics, the most important groups of mycotoxins
