abstract

the r package irtplay provides practical tools for unidimensional item
response theory (irt) models that conveniently enable users to conduct
many analyses related to irt. for example, the irtplay includes functions for
calibrating online items, scoring test-takers’ proficiencies, evaluating irt
model-data fit, and importing item and/or proficiency parameter estimates
from the output of popular irt software. in addition, the irtplay package

many analyses related to irt such as calibrating online items, scoring test-

takers’ proficiencies, and evaluating irt model-data fit. the irtplay software
package is quite user-friendly and its functions are easy to implement. in
addition, the irtplay package supports mixed-item formats consisting of
dichotomous and polytomous items. for the polytomous items, the graded
response model and the (generalized) partial credit models are available.
