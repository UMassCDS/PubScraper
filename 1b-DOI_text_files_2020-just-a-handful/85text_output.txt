ilicone membranes of 58 im thickness were exposed!4i to an oxygen plasma for
5 min. this procedure has a significant literaturel@5-27) and is known to
hydrophilize pdms. water contact angles for these samples changed from @4/8p =
105°/83° to 46°/19° upon plasma treatment.241 x-ray photoelectron spectra,
which indicate an increase in oxygen content and a decrease in carbon content,
and scanning electron micrographs, that indicate no change of topography are
shown in figure s3, supporting information. figure 3c shows water mass loss
data for both oxygen plasma-treated membranes, one measured with the
hydrophilic side in contact with water vapor in the vial and the other (run as a
control) with the hydrophobic side in contact with the water vapor. the
membrane with its hydrophilic side in contact with water vapor shows a ~60%
greater water vapor transmission rate than an identical film in the opposite
orientation. this corresponds to a permeability rate greater than 6000 in the units
discussed above. the control experiment shows a permeability rate less than
4000. we note that the 58 im data in figure 1 and all of the measurements
described in figure $2, supporting information, comprise controls for this
experiment as well and exhibit indistinguishable permeability rates less than
4000.

these two observations, 1) that water vapor transmission through thin water
repellent pdms films occurs at nearly the same rate as water transmission
through the air and 2) that water vapor does not macroscopically condense on
thin pdms films if the vapor pressure is sufficiently low on the opposite side,
suggest multiple applications of thin silicone films. obvious ones are the same as
those that expanded poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (goretex) and nonwoven
polyolefins (tyvek) are employed for, where a liquid water barrier that permits
vapor transmission is required. the silicone film differs from these porous
alternatives in that it is continuous (not porous), thus will slow air and other gas
permeation as indicated in figure 1. it also differs in its transparency and may be
useful in non-fogging applications. we draw attention to these observations by
including two applications in the title of this paper that have stimulated significant
current research and investment: water purification! 2°) and anti-icing
(icephobicity).". 32] 4 homogeneous silicone film is a much simpler strategy for
desalination or water purification than using composite structures of
transmembrane carbon nanotubes! *4] or aquaporin channels.25! if water were
frozen in contact with a silicone membrane that permits water permeation at the
rates described here, no adhesion would occur. the ice would sublime and
permeate, creating a weak boundary layer, as long as the water vapor pressure at
the opposite side of the membrane was reduced sufficiently.

permeate, creating a weak boundary layer, as long as the water vapor pressure at
the opposite side of the membrane was reduced sufficiently.

why does water vapor permeate through pdms at such an astonishing and
counter-intuitive rate? a discussion of this is conspicuously absent from the
paper''®] that reports the data contained in figure 1. comments on this anomaly
were certainly as warranted in 1968 as they are now. we make several that
pertain to the unusual structure of pdms, are aided by insight from relatively
recent nanoscience, and that we believe lead to a qualitative understanding of
this anomaly. importantly, the high permeability is not because of solubility
(permeability = diffusivity x solubility). the solubility of water in silicones is
extremely low, less than 1 ppm.4 solubility is, however, the reason that co2 and
ethane (c2he) exhibit relatively high values (table 1). figure 4 shows the chemical
structures of pdms and water drawn with accurate relative bond lengths: si—o =
1.90 a, si—c = 1.63 a, o—h=0.96 a. the si—o and si—c bonds are significantly
longer than the c—c bonds (1.53 a) that most polymers are comprised of,
permitting flexibilities that are not possible in most polymers. this, coupled with
the fact that the sio bonds are =51% ionic,°71 allows the si—o—si bond system
“to readily pass through the 180° state’. these motions are responsible for the
unusually high compressibility of pdms (over 30%),") the low glass transition
temperature (below -120 °c),9l and the highest fractional free volume of any
common polymer. with these comments in mind, we choose to not invoke any

unusually high compressibility of pdms (over 30%),/3*! the low glass transition
temperature (below -120 °c),9l and the highest fractional free volume of any
common polymer. with these comments in mind, we choose to not invoke any
new mechanism to explain the anomalous water permeation in pdms, but to
suggest that a mechanism that is the same or very similar to those proposed for
carbon nanotubes3. 4] and aquaporins™5i is operative. hydrogen-bonded chains
or “wires” of 1d condensed water are pulled through sub-nanometer diameter
pores present in pdms (figure 4) from the high to low water vapor pressure sides
of the membrane. this requires that dynamic nanopores are possible in pdms
and the fractional free volume, compressibility values, and the fact that the
experiments were performed at temperatures greater than 150 °c above the
glass transition temperature encourage this conjecture. no suggestion is made
that any interaction between water and the dynamic pdms-lined nanopores is
operative, and these pores are envisioned as hydrophobic, as are the interiors of
carbon nanotubes. hydrogen bonding between water and silicones is not
observed. we suspect that the author of ref. !9l, had he been aware of the
behavior of water in nanoscopic confinement, would have thought that this
mechanism was consistent with the anomalous behavior he reports and would
have made comments similar to these.

gradually as membrane thickness decreases from 160 to 15 ym, but

thick membranes are =60% of the value of the open container and emphasize
that water vapor flux through these films is greater than half the flux through air.
figure 2b shows permeability values, calculated from the data in figure 2a, using
the same units as figure 1 and the publication!"4] discussed above. the values for
this material property are obviously thickness-dependent and span the
reported!" value of 3600 (film sample thickness is not provided). thickness-
dependent permeability of he and co) in thin pdms membranes has been
reported’5] and explained by non-equilibrium sorption/desorption at the
interface. this same argument can be made for water through the membranes
described here and we summarize this argument as a mechanism in figure 3a.
water vapor adsorbs (k;) and dissolves (kz) (sorption), permeates through the
membrane (kp), and desorbs (k_, k.1) at low the pressure (water partial pressure)
side of the membrane. when the film thickness is decreased sufficiently so that
the water vapor transmission rate increases above a critical value, sorption
(adsorption and dissolution) becomes rate-limiting. we note an interesting
practical result of the kinetics of this process. when the membrane film is
sufficiently thin and the vapor pressure is sufficiently low, condensation is not
apparent on the internal membrane surface. nucleation and growth of droplets
occur with thicker films and higher vapor pressures. figure 3b shows

at sufficiently low vapor pressure and film thickness, the vapor transmission rate
great enough to compete with droplet nucleation and growth. this competition
is indicated in figure 3a by kp and kc.

washers containing %-inch (12.7 mm) diameter holes were attached (epoxy) to the

sample-to-sample, which were cut as 25 mm diameter samples with a punch. for

abstract

cross-linked polydimethylsiloxane (pdms) is simultaneously water-repellent
and highly permeable to water vapor. unfilled and silica-free cross-linked
pdms films of variable thickness (8-160 jum) are prepared and their water
vapor transmission rates and permeability values are determined. vapor
transmission rate increases as membrane thickness decreased from 160 to
15 jim, but does not increase further when the film thickness is decreased to
8 im. rate-limiting sorption is implicated as the cause of this effect and
substantiated by a surface modification to enhance adsorption rate. water

this kinetic regime, and vapor transmission rates as high as 60% of the
transmission rates through air are measured. a mechanism for water
permeation is offered based on those proposed for nanoscopically confined
water in carbon nanotubes and aquaporins.
