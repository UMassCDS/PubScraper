discussion

the contribution of trace elements in carcinogenesis recently gained
increasing interest both for the identification of new pathogenetic
mechanisms (4, 25-27) and the identification of prognostic factors (28). in
this study, we precisely investigated the role of trace elements in liver
carcinogenesis and the possible association with hcc survival rate. we also
evaluated the expression levels of specific mts, proteins involved in trace
elements homeostasis, their epigenetic regulation through promoter dna
methvlatinn and the nascihle cannection with hcc nroanasis thrauinh this
carefully selected to be free from hcv/hbv infection, in order focus mainly
on factors different from those commonly known to be associated to liver
cancer development. serum trace elements levels were within the normal
range (23), even if se and zn concentrations were very close to the lowest
reference values, consistently with previous findings (5). interestingly, serum
cu levels were directly associated with a significantly decreased survival rate
and those patients with serum cu levels in the highest quintile had a
mortality risk more than six-fold higher as compared to patients within the
other four quintiles groups, substantially higher hr than previously reported
in a cohort of chinese patients (28). that study had also reported an
association of cu/zn ratio with increased mortality, while results from the
present study show that the statistical significance is probably driven by the
effects of serum cu levels. as previously suggested by balter and colleagues,
the effects on serum cu levels in hcc patients could depend on the
reallocation in the body of the fraction of cu bound to cysteine-rich proteins
such as mts (29). in order to get valuable insights in the relationship between
trace elements and hcc, we also quantified trace elements content in the
studies (30, 31) whose data remained controversial since the differences
were not, in all cases, statistically significant (30). a reduced amount of zn in
cancer tissue was observed by several studies and seems to be a specificity
of hcc (27). in our study we observed the reduction of zn content in hcc
tissues and the concomitant down-regulation of mts, precisely of mt1g and
mt1h. surprisingly, in 2 out of 27 hcc tissues, zn content was extremely
high and the two mts were up-regulated. these data confirm the strong link
between zn levels and mts regulation and suggest the need for further
investigations on the role of zn in hcc. in fact, intracellular zn has a dual
role, namely an anti-oxidant function but, in case of overload, it can also
promote cellular oxidative stress (9). as for cu content, it was highly variable
in the hcc tissues collected in the present study, and the differences
observed for the comparison with non-neoplastic tissue were not statistically
significant. hence, the relationship between cu content and mts expression
does not appear as univocal as that with zn, and leads toward the hypothesis
of the involvement of other possible regulatory mechanisms, namely other
mts isoforms or other proteins able to bind divalent metals, hypotheses to
mechanism responsible tor m/1g and m/1h down-regulation in hcc came
from our previous observations by genome-wide microarray-based
approach (17) and from other studies that observed a promoter dna
hypermethylation of mt1g in hcc (11, 35, 36). in the present study, we
propose that the hypermethylation of a specific region is involved in the
simultaneous repression of both mt1g and mtih. the finding of mt1has a
possible tumor suppressor gene silenced by promoter hypermethylation is
novel for hcc and previously observed only in prostate cancer (37). another
interesting result refers to the association of higher mtig/mtih promoter
methylation levels with increased mortality. previous observations in this
regard are limited, conflicting, and sometimes without statistical significance.
recently, zeng and colleagues observed an unexpected association of mtig
hypermethylation with good survival (35) while kanda and colleagues
previously observed a worse survival associated with mt1g hypermethylation
but without reaching statistical significance (36). findings from the present
study could help to clarify this issue and, furthermore, suggest a new
possible epigenetic prognostic factor for hcc identified at early stages. the
se sf ep spt rests
evaluated, and the missing data for some parameters of the enrolled
patients, both of which may have limited reaching the statistical significance
for certain outcomes. although further studies specifically focused on
unveiling the features underlying such relationships at a cellular and
molecular level are needed, the present observations highlight a novel
perspective for a potential etiopathogenetic and preventive approach by
addressing epigenetic mechanisms of disease.

mt1g, mt1h, and zip8 gene expression analysis in liver tissues

gene expression analysis was performed for the two mts, i.e. mt1g and
mt1h, able to bind divalent heavy metal ions such as cu and zn and for a
zinc transporter, i.e. slc39a8 (also known as z/p8). as shown in figure 4,
both mt1g and mt1h were strongly repressed in the majority of hcc
tissues. precisely, mtzh was repressed in 24 out of 27 hcc tissue samples
and mt1gwas repressed in 23 out of 27 hcc tissues. the two hcc tissues
showing a marked increase in mt1g and mt1h expression were those with
very high zn content (figure 3). on the contrary, the zn transporter z/p8 did
not show a statistically significant difference for transcriptional regulation in
hcc tissues as compared to n tissues (p = 0.313)

‘similarly, zn levels were reduced in 24 out of 2/ hcc tissues while 2 hcc
tissues showed extremely high zn levels that paralleled with the increase in
mtg and mt1h gene expression (figure 3). as for cu content, the tendency
was not so evident, and the differences were not statistically significant. in
particular, 13 patients showed an increase of cu levels in hcc tissue as

survival rate according to serum trace elements content

after a follow-up period of a median time of 40 months, 23 deaths (48.9%)
were observed. serum trace elements concentrations were analyzed
according to patient's survival rate. by univariate cox regression analysis,
serum cu levels were directly associated to increasing mortality (p = 0.009),
while no significant association was found for se and zn serum levels (p =
0.136 and p = 0.256, respectively). this result was confirmed after
adjustment for sex and age (p = 0.001), as well as by including all the trace

significant (p = 0.483), thereby indicating that proportional hazard
assumption was not violated. stratifying the study population according to
quintiles of serum cu concentrations, kaplan-meier survival curves showed
that mortality rate increased by increasing cu levels, with a very high rate
(88.9%) among subjects within the highest quintile of distribution (p = 0.025
by log rank test for trend). considering a threshold value at the 80"
percentile of cu levels (1,118 1g/l), subjects with cu concentration above
this value had a significantly decreased survival rate (p < 0.001 by log-rank
test—figure 1) with a marked increased hazard ratio for mortality (hr 6.88
with 95% cl 2.60-18.23, p < 0.001 by cox regression). high cu serum
concentrations remained associated with an increased risk of mortality after
adjustment for sex and age, zn and se levels, and even tumor grading and
microvascular invasion in the regression models (table 2). the significance
was maintained also in the adjusted model in which all the variable showing
a correlation with serum cu levels were included, i.e. hemoglobin,

clinical and biochemical characteristics of hcc patients

forty-nine hcc patients, 42 males and 7 females, were enrolled for this
study. their main clinical and biochemical characteristics are reported in
table 1. they had a mean age of 70.8 + 6.9 years and were all free from
hepatitis b or c infections, according to the enrolment criteria. biochemical
indexes of hepatic function were consistent with a compensated liver
disease, while the mean alpha-fetoprotein levels (24.8 g/l) were above the
(supplementary figure 1). analyses were also performed for possible
correlation among serum concentrations of cu, zn, and se (supplementary
table 2) and for correlation among the serum trace elements and clinical
variables (supplementary table 3).
promoter dna methylation analysis by bisulfite amplicon sequencing
(bsas)

genomic dna was extracted from hcc and n tissues of 23 patients by
wizard® genomic dna purification kit (promega corporation, fitchburg, wi,
usa). dna methylation was assessed by next generation sequencing (ngs)
performing bsas of a region overlapping mt1g and mt1h promoter. the
region of interest was selected among those resulting hypermethylated in
hcc tissues, according to our previous microarray-based observations (17).
the selected region was located at -598 bp/-999 bp from the transcription
start site (tss) of mt1g and it corresponded to the region -1151 bp/-750bp
from the tss of mt1h.

of 95°c for 30 s, 55°c for 30 s, 72°c for 30 s; 72°c for 7 min. pcr products
were purified by qliaquick pcr columns (giagen, hilden, germany),
quantified using picogreen and confirmed through agarose gel
electrophoresis.

ngs library preparation
library preparation was performed with an illumina truseq nano dna library
prep kit (illumina, san diego, ca, usa) according to the manufacturer's
instructions. briefly, pcr products were end-repaired at 30°c for 30 min and
purified by magnetic beads. “a” nucleotide was added to the 3’ ends of the
blunt fragments using a-tailing mix reagent by incubating at 37°c for 30 min,
and then at 70°c for 5 min. indexing adapters were ligated to the ends of
pcr products using ligation mix 2 reagent at 30°c for 10 min. after two
washes with sample purification beads, pcr was performed to enrich those

preprocessing, genome mapping, and methylation levels profiling
potentially existing sequencing adapters and raw quality bases in the low
reads were trimmed by skewer (21). the option -x
agatcggaagagcacacgtctgaactccagtca and -y
agatcggaagagcgtcgtgtagggaaagagtgt were used for the common
adapter sequence of the illumina truseq adapters and the option -q 0 -1 25 -
k 3 -r 0.1 -d 0.1 was used for trimming low quality 5’ and 3' ends of the raw
reads. the cleaned high-quality reads after trimming the low-quality bases
and sequencing adapters were mapped to the reference genome by bs-
seeker2 software (22). since the alignment proceeds with reference to some
specific genic regions of the genome sequence, 10% miss-mapping rate was
allowed. bs-seeker2 was used for the methylation levels profiling at single-

base resolution from the mapping results.

concentrations showed a non-gaussian distribution so they were log-
transformed. paired student's t-test was applied to compare pairwise the
levels of trace elements and of cgs % methylation between hcc and
homologous n tissues. the non-parametric wilcoxon signed-rank test was
applied to compare the expression levels of mt1g, mtih, and zip8 between
hcc and n tissue: the comparison was performed between the fold change
values of each gene and the value of 1, corresponding to the lack of variation
in gene expression levels between the two tissues (hcc versus n tissue)
survival analyses were performed on 47 hcc patients; two subjects were
excluded since they deceased during hospitalization due to surgical
complications. kaplan-meier survival curves were drawn using the log-rank
test (mantel-cox test) to examine the differences in survival according to
serum trace elements. patients were censored at the last follow-up date up
to a maximum of 110 months. hazard ratio (hr) of mortality with 95% cl was

hbv or hcv infections and surgical resectability criteria were a preserved
liver function, child- pugh class a, the presence of a resectable single tumor
or oligofocal resectable nodules (maximum three nodules), and the absence
of extrahepatic metastases. the resectability assessment also included the
tumor local stage, major vascular invasion, and the presence of affected
lymphonodes (17, 18). the study protocol conformed to the ethical
guidelines of the 1975 declaration of helsinki and was approved by the
ethical review board of the university of verona school of medicine hospital
(verona, italy). written informed consent was obtained from each patient
after a detailed explanation of the study. routine laboratory tests were
performed including a complete blood count, indexes of hepatic function,
and serological tests for hbv and hcv. a detailed clinical history was
recorded for all the patients and a periodic evaluation was performed during

a follow-up period up to 110 months. data of tumor grading and

before the surgical intervention, blood samples were drawn from each
patient in bd vacutainer® tubes without anticoagulant reagents, centrifuged
at 2.500 x g for 15 min at room temperature and the serum was collected
and stored at -20°c for subsequent analyses. hcc and homologous non-
neoplastic liver (n) tissues were collected immediately after surgical excision,
sliced into aliquots of about 100 mg, snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen, and
stored at -80°c. aliquots for rna extraction were immediately homogenized
in 2 ml of tri® reagent (sigma-aldrich, st. louis, mo, usa) and the
homogenate stored at -80°c until use. a pathologist unaware of the patient
participation to the study performed the histological analysis of liver tissues.

trace elements analysis in serum and liver tissue samples by inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry (icp-ms) analysis

copper, selenium, and zinc contents were determined by icp-ms in the
serum of the 49 hcc patients and in hcc and n tissues of a subset of 27
patients. tissue sample preparation and mineralization protocol were
chemical, munich, germany) were used as certified reference material. the
icp-ms analysis was performed as previously reported (19) and the isotopes
measured were ©cu, ©©zn, 78se, and 82se. 82se was acquired in standard
mode while ©cu, zn, and 78se were acquired in kinetic energy
discrimination (ked) modality with collision cell technology (cct) system
using helium and hydrogen as collision gases. trace elements
concentrations were reported as ng/mg of wet weight for tissues and as.
ug/l for serum samples.

gene expression analyses in liver tissue samples

gene expression analyses of mt1g, mtih, and of slc39a8 (zip8), a zn
transporter, were performed by real-time rt-pcr in hcc and n tissues of
27 patients. the rna samples were extracted with tri® reagent following
the manufacturer's protocol, treated with turbo dna-free™ kit (ambion by
thermo fisher scientific, waltham, ma, usa) and quantified with qubit® rna
broad-range assay kit (thermo fisher scientific). reverse transcription was
a v 0 if

     

relative gene expression was defined as fold change according to the 2-44ct
method (20).
introduction

liver cancer is the sixth most commonly diagnosed cancer and the fourth
leading cause of cancer death worldwide, and hepatocellular carcinoma
(hcc) is the most frequent primary liver cancer (1). in the majority of cases,
hcc develops within an established background of chronic liver disease
(70-90% of all patients) caused by hepatitis c virus (hcv) or hepatitis b virus
(hbv) infection or by alcohol abuse (2). however, the etiology remains
largely unknown, especially for the non-viral hcc and the interest to identify
circulating markers of survival is object of experimental research. particular
was recently dedicated to the role of snecific trace elements i

   

liver
5). copper participates to the production of oxygen free radicals and its
accumulation in the liver seems the most plausible trigger toward the
carcinogenetic processes (6). selenium is involved in the protection against
free radicals, being an essential component of the antioxidative glutathione
peroxidases pathway, and se deficiency was reported in association with
increased incidence of hcc (7, 8). zinc is an essential metal for life that
mainly acts as an antioxidant, even though, in the case of intracellular zn
overload it can also be involved, on the contrary, in promoting cellular
oxidative stress (9). the role of zn, however, has been mostly studied in
relation to its antioxidant activity through the catalytic action of copper/zinc-
superoxide dismutase, the protection of the protein sulfhydryl groups, and
the up-regulation of metallothioneins (mts). mts are low molecular weight
cysteine-rich intracellular proteins capable to bind essential and toxic metals.
they lead a pivotal role in the cellular functions of detoxification and
protection against oxidative stress, due to their ability to scavenge free
radicals (10). recently, mt1 isoforms, in particular mt1m and mt1g, were
suggested as possible biomarkers for hcc and other human cancers (11). a
gene-specific hypermethylation and genomic dna hypo-methylation, has
been observed in many cancer tissues and cancer precursor cells (15)
suggesting dna methylation as a suitable cancer biomarker (16). ina
previous study, we characterized genome-wide dna methylation and gene
expression profiles of hcc tissues by microarray technologies and observed
that promoter hypermethylation is associated to transcriptional repression of
two mts, suggesting a role for dna methylation in gene silencing (17). the
first aim of the present study was to investigate the role of trace elements in
hcc by analyzing their content in serum and liver tissues and consequently
to evaluate a possible correlation between serum trace elements
concentrations and survival rate. additional purposes were to unravel the
function of promoter dna methylation in regulating mt1g and mt1h gene
expression and to assess the possible correlation of mts promoter
methylation with hcc survival rate.

development are largely unknown. the role of trace elements and proteins
regulating metal ions homeostasis, i.e. metallothioneins (mts), recently
gained an increased interest. object of the study was to investigate the role
of promoter dna methylation in mts transcriptional regulation and the
possible prognostic significance of serum trace elements in hcc.

methods: forty-nine hcc patients were enrolled and clinically
characterized. cu, se, and zn contents were measured by inductively
coupled plasma mass spectrometry in the serum and, for a subset of 27
patients, in hcc and homologous non-neoplastic liver (n) tissues. mt1g and
mt1h gene expression in hepatic tissues was assessed by real-time rt-pcr
and the specific promoter dna methylation by bisulfite-amplicon
sequencing

results: patients with cu serum concentration above the 80” percentile had
a significantly decreased survival rate (p < 0.004) with a marked increased
hazard ratio for mortality (hr 6.88 with 95% cl 2.60-18.23, p < 0.001). se
regulation and methylation levels of three specitic cpgs paralleled to an
increased mortality rate among the 23 patients analyzed (p = 0.015)

conelusions: mt1g and mt1h act as potential tumor suppressor genes
regulated through promoter dna methylation and, together with serum cu
concentrations, be related to survival rate in hcc.
