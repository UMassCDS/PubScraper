conclusion

involuntary civil commitment to treatment for opioid use disorder
carries significant potential harms that, if unaddressed, may
outweigh its benefits. findings can inform policies and practices
for ensuring that involuntary civil commitment is used in an
ethically responsible way that achieves a sound balance across
beneficence, autonomy, and non-maleficence.
limitations and strengths

ings are based on a non-random convenience sample of 70
\dividuals receiving or providing moud in otp settings in
western massachusetts. small sample sizes are the norm in
qualitative research” and are not intended to support
generalizations, but rather provide depth of information.” also,
findings may not reflect the experiences and perspectives of
individuals who have not provided or received moud. a signifi-
cant limitation is that this study is based in massachusetts, with
unique icc-related laws and procedures, and so findings might
not generalize to other states. some participants shared
experiences that massachusetts is actively working to address

  

   

unique icc-related laws and procedures, and so findings might
not generalize to other states. some participants shared
experiences that massachusetts is actively working to address
(e.g., provision of icc outside of jail settings, especially for
women), and therefore these issues may not be as salient for
current icc programming. also, some individuals shared
experiences that had occurred many years previously, and
therefore reports may be subject to retrospective recall biases.
inally, despite facilitator instructions and probes, some
participants may have conflated icc with drug court experiences
or experiences with other criminal justice diversion options. a
strength is that we solicited perspectives regarding icc from
individuals receiving oud treatment, a population that previously
has been little studied. also, the study is set in massachusetts,
which has a large and growing icc program. finally, in contrast to
most icc research, which has mostly utilized an observational
design,” we employed qualitative methods to explore the
experiences of patients with oud, their allies, and their healthcare
providers. we thereby gain insight into the complex set of factors

that shape views regar« ic

that shape views regarding icc.

 
establish icc outcomes

participants expressed reservations about the fact that there is
now insufficient evidence to make an informed decision about
whether the short-term benefits of icc are outweighed by its
potential long-term harms. in particular, little research has been
conducted to understand intermediate and long-term icc
outcomes and variation in outcomes by program characteristics. it
is critical that studies are conducted to provide empirical evidence
on a range of such issues. these include, for example, studies on
the variability of icc programs, including their provision of health
and social services (e.g., type, amount, frequency), types of
patients for whom icc is most effective, whether icc has better
outcomes than alternative policies, and the cumulative effect of
icc events over the short- and long-term. in the absence of such
evidence, broad diffusion of icc as a potential solution to the

outcomes than alternative policies, and the cumulative effect of
icc events over the short- and long-term. in the absence of such
evidence, broad diffusion of icc as a potential solution to the
opioid epidemic risks being an unethical and inappropriate use of
public resources.

educate patients, allies, and clinicians about
the practice and ethics of icc

results revealed that patients, their allies, and treatment
practitioners are not knowledgeable about icc, are uncertain of
the relevant ethical issues, and are unsure how to act ethically
when working with icc-eligible patients. these knowledge gaps
mean that the actual and potential burdens of icc have mostly
gone unrecognized. findings point to the need for more
education about icc policies and procedures. examples of ethical
and other educational topics worth considering include: principles
of autonomy and nonmaleficence in relation to treating
individuals with oud, where individuals are placed in care, the
type of treatment provided, the duration of confinement,
processes for community re-entry, expected outcomes and
impacts, safeguards to minimize potential harms, potential
alternatives to icc, and other information that would enable
individuals to weigh the potential harms and benefits of icc. also
needed are forums such as ethics consultations to consider icc

ethical conflicts and potential solutions.

treat icc patients with dignity, especially
given the context of being denied liberty

many icc programs have historically treated patients in criminal
justice settings, and in discriminatory ways in which the
circumstances and type of services offered differ by gender and
other sociodemographic factors.” the results presented here
support the need for administering icc in healthcare settings,
instead of jail, a point of virtually unanimous consensus across
patients their allies and providers. specifically, participants shared
their preferences for icc processes and contexts that are safe,
humanely enacted and negotiable within reasonable limits. in this
context, the concepts and practices of shared decision-making
may offer strategies to better incorporate patients’ healthcare
needs and preferences into icc programming. at the same time,
‘context, the concepts and practices or shared decision-making,
may offer strategies to better incorporate patients’ healthcare
needs and preferences into icc programming. at the same time,
participants made it clear that icc should only be used as the last
resort when all other options have been exhausted. they also
shared why patients sometimes arranged to have themselves
committed, i.e., because of limited or no community-based
treatment options, which raises further important questions
about justice and the lack of sufficient treatment beds.
additionally, while the state pays for icc in massachusetts, icc
may not be a mechanism to receive state-provided services in
other jurisdictions, i.e., states where the petitioner has to sign a
guaranty of payment for treatment under icc. these findings
underscore participants’ identification of the need for
communities to expand the oud system of care and create other
alternatives to icc.
ensure icc provides medications for oud and
other evidence-based care

our results reveal how few patients receive any of the three fda-
approved medications to treat oud, either within icc settings or
after icc exit. these experiences contradict recommendations by
most health experts who view oud as a chronic health condition
best managed with medications.”| patients with oud who are
treated with medications have lower mortality,” less opioid use,”
less infectious disease risk, and other positive outcomes.” for
these reasons, all three fda-approved medications for oud
should be offered to patients within icc settings. also, icc should
be integrated with the community-based oud treatment system
of care such that at icc exit, patients may readily continue to

‘e medications and other evidence-based care.

tegrated with the community-based oud treatment system
acknowledge that icc serves a vulnerable
patient population

akey finding is that patients with oud and those around them
turn to icc as a last resort, that is, in the context of immediate
and life-threatening crises. this is a context of urgency in which
icc patients are perceived to have impaired decisional capacity,
for example due to opioid and poly-substance use and co-

ond ite hreaten ig crises. hs ‘a context tt urgency in araett

icc patients are perceived to have impaired decisional capacity,
for example due to opioid and poly-substance use and co-
occurring mental illness. therefore, it should be common practice
that validated and objective measures are used to make such
determinations. also, icc patients are perceived to lack the
resources (e.g., legal advocate) and skills that are needed to
understand their healthcare choices and make informed decisions
or advocate for their own health interests. well-known potential
remedies, such as requirements for third party verification, are
warranted. moreover, like mental health and imprisoned
populations, many consider that oud patients constitute a
vulnerable population who should be afforded a higher standard
of protection. overcrowding, insufficient staffing,” staff stress,”
compassion fatigue (“burn-out”), ° and high staff turnover
further undermine treatment quality and prospects for
successfully maintaining recovery. these factors jeopardize the
ability of the icc program to yield beneficial outcomes. thus, icc-
eligible individuals should be seen as a population of vulnerable
patients whose status warrants added protections to guard

eligible individuals should be seen as a population of vulnerable

against potential harms.
a patient suggested that before deciding to continue or
expand icc, we need “better information first. see how many
people are having success stories from being sectioned, and
how many people are just going back out and using. take that
information and use that to make the decision to get rid of it
[icc] or [keep it]”

another patient said, “...expanding section 35 is probably
not the best of ideas, or spending the money for it, because...
we don't want it doing... what bad it's doing. we don't want to
exacerbate the situation. i'm sure the money can best go to
other methods...”

 

exacerbate the situation. i'm sure the money can best go to

aclinician said, “when i heard of section 35, the first thing
that i thought of was how many section 35s can we possibly
have, 100, 1000, 10,000? every time somebody uses, you're
going to section 35 them? you'll run out of space very
quickly.”

a clinician explained, “we're sending people on the street
because we can't get them a bed at long-term treatment.
then the cycle starts all over again and maybe they'll crash
into a car with a kid in it, or a mother, your uncle. if there was
more treatment out there, that was voluntary, maybe we
wouldn't have to section 35 people.”

primary results and imp ications

our results suggest that, despite some perceived benefits among
ins and persons with oud, the extent to which icc for oud
restricts individual liberty may not be proportionate to the harm it
will prevent. specifically, while icc is likely to achieve its stated
goals of saving lives from fatal opioid overdoses while the patient
is confined, this benefit is likely to be at the expense of potentially
worsening long-term opioid overdose risks. the kass framework
suggests that health department officials have a responsibility to
remove from policy debate those programs that are unethical,
whether because of insufficient data, clearly discriminatory
procedures, or unjustified limitations on personal liberties. since
we initiated the present study, concerned professionals have
increasingly called for actions to minimize the potential harms of
icc, or eliminate it altogether.” our results point to several areas
where remedial efforts could potentially minimize current harms,
provide minimal criteria to justify suspending the right to
informed consent, and increase the potential for benefits over the
long-term.

participants questioned whether icc is an empirically-supported
program. some doubted whether icc is a sustainable solution.
participants suggested that instead of icc, the community should

increase long-term treatment capacity or invest in other
alternatives that would eliminate the need for icc altogether.
a clinician explained, “we know that anytime there is
abstinence, there's a decrease in tolerance, so there will be
some [icc] folks that...will be at a higher risk of overdose.”
another clinician explained that after icc exit, “...their
tolerance is going to drop so quickly and so fast that if they
aren't getting the assistance and [instead] they're just re-
sectioned, held, and then released back to exactly where they
came out of, they're probably going to use, and they're
probably going to die. so is it really saving somebody's life? i

 

sectioned, held, and then released back to exactly where they
came out of, they're probably going to use, and they're
probably going to die. so is it really saving somebody's life? i
don't know. it might be, for a few days, but it could be putting
them at greater risk, also.”

a third clinician said, “a lot of people tell me it [icc] stops
that runaway train, they're so out of control, it just stops it.
gives them an opportunity to...stop a runaway train, [but] by
putting a brick wall in front of it.”

to address these problems, clinicians called for better integration
of icc with existing healthcare systems. specifically, clinicians
suggested that at icc exit, patients be provided with immediate
access to metha-done and other oud medications, aftercare
planning, and regular check-ins regarding treatment progress
after community re-entry.
p1: “they [patients] don't have the connections anymore,
which is part of why [it is important for clinicians to]...
humanize everybody and just treat them like a human
being... because we would be the first people in
someone's life to treat them like a human being, [that]
they are a good and worthy person no matter what kind
of behaviors we see...[starts to cry]

 

they are a good and worthy person no matter what kind

overall well-being...

p1:...that, just, they have a value.”

also, of great concern among clinicians was that icc decreases
opioid tolerance without providing supports for continued
treatment in the community after icc exit.
to explain what was most upsetting about icc, two clinicians
described how icc can jeopardize their special therapeutic role in
helping patients to understand that they are humans with value
despite their oud:
may worsen risks over the long-term

participants described icc as “a short-term solution that's going
to lead to long-term problems.” for example, participants worried
that icc places patients in criminal justice contexts where they are
more likely to accrue additional legal trouble or could cause
patients to view oud treatment negatively. participants also

that icc places patients in criminal justice contexts where they are
more likely to accrue additional legal trouble or could cause
patients to view oud treatment negatively. participants also
worried that icc does not help patients find reasons to remain in
recovery, but instead worsens oud-related social stigma and
ultimately isolates and dehumanizes patients.
one clinician said “t hate that it's coercive, but you have to do
what you have to do. and when you're saving somebody's life,
and they can't help themselves, you have to take the tough
love approach.”

another clinician observed that “...with section 35, self-
determination [is] just completely taken away,” wondering “is

 

love approach.”

another clinician observed that “...with section 35, self-
determination [is] just completely taken away,” wondering “is
it our right to make decisions for other people when we're
taking away their rights by doing that?” this clinician shared
she was “uncomfortable” with icc being an example of how
the medical field is “violating” or “controlling” people's rights.
she observed that icc “...definitely, straight-up seems like one
[violation of rights], hands-down, and i think people should
be able to make their own decisions. even if it's causing them
harm, it's their choice...[icc] is going against what i feel like
are my values.”
another clinician said “we will sometimes recommend [icc]
and call a family member and say, ‘you need to do this’

another clinician said “we will sometimes recommend [icc]
and call a family member and say, ‘you need to do this’
[because the patient's] mental health condition has
deteriorated to the point where they really need to go
inpatient, and they will not go. we can't make them go.”

participants suggested that icc could be improved if there were
processes in place to offer options for help such that patients
could voluntarily “choose icc or another fate.” clinicians talked
about being uncomfortable with the coerciveness of icc,
expressing uncertainty and uneasiness with the idea that icc may
be an infringement of human rights.
“p1: “but i wasn't the one doing the sectioning. i was
recommending [to the patient] ‘you know what your
father's going to do...let him section you, please!’

p2: and that's letting her make the choice to be sectioned.
p1: exactly, exactly...she wasn't willing to go to detox. she
knew she would bounce...she had bounced from several
programs before, and had used up her last straws...she
knew what her family was going to do. and she was like,
‘this [icc] is the best thing for me, i guess.”
 

ian explained to another:
another clinician shared that a patient with oud “...probably
already feels very out-of-control, like they don't make very
good decisions. and i don't think that taking further control
away from them is always a good idea... [because] it kind of

two patients explained:
coercive

other perceived icc harms stem from the fact that it forces
patients into getting help against their will. participants explained
how the coerciveness of icc may have negative consequences,

it may undermine patient autonomy and empowerment,
anger patients, cause patients to “rebel,” increase patient
resistance to behavioral change, and lead to a return to opioid

 

use.

a patient said “...when i got sectioned, there was no medicine.
no methadone... i've been through the worst...it just showed
me what way don't go. i learned to never do that [icc] to
somebody.”

another patient said “you get methadone for a few days
[under icc] and then you're off. if you're on methadone, they
keep you on the methadone but you can't go up or down or
anything like that. but you do get methadone for seven days
and then you go over to the other side [of the icc facility] and
stay there for the rest of your time.”

a clinician said “and up until recently, if you were on
methadone, you didn't know if you were going to be sent to...
[jail facility] for the criminally insane...and that place didn't
really have much [methadone] treatment...really no

facility that provided methadone]...[it's] a roll of the dice if
you're going to try to section somebody who was on
methadone...not knowing if there would be a bed available
[that provided methadone].”

another clinician said that icc without medications for oud
is “...cruel and unusual punishment, 100%...that's a really,
really cruel thing to do to somebody. i think that for a long
time, medication-assisted treatment was the end of the
road...and it really should be a front-line resource. because it's
the same as any other disease...you're going to take
medications to treat something while you get everything else
together...if you don't know what it [withdrawal] feels like, it
sucks. so i would not...wish it on anybody and i think it's a
really cruel thing to do to somebody.”

 

in adi in to withholding oud medications, participants noted
sucks. so i would not...wish it on anybody and i think it's a

really cruel thing to do to somebody.”

in addition to withholding oud medications, participants noted
several other shortcomings of icc processes and settings. for
example, icc was described as a lengthy process that is “difficult”
to navigate, in part because it requires that family members or
physicians interact with the courts. also, participants noted that
icc facilities are located 45-120 minutes away by car from where
patients reside, which makes it hard for family to visit, thus
further isolating patients. participants felt icc would not
meaningfully change patients' oud because the duration of icc
treatment (generally <30 days) was too short, but also because
icc did not provide counseling or therapy, and it was not
equipped to appropriately treat co-occurring psychiatric
conditions. participants shared how for these and other reasons,
some patients who had experienced icc never wanted to be
sectioned again.

  
provides limited or no medications to treat
oud or other evidence-based care

participants shared several ways in which icc fell short of patient's
specific health needs and desired outcomes. most notably,
participants stated that icc generally provides limited or no
medications to treat oud. this situation was described as “cruel

and unusual punishment” and “torture.

awoman patient shared “...one of the bad things i was

not getting harmed physically, emotionally, whatever — they
have to call dcf [department of children and families]...it's
{icc] ripping apart families and instead of giving...families
help... just don't think it's fair because...as a woman...my
biggest fear was my children and me being honest about my
addiction or wanting to get help held me back because i knew
somebody was going to call [dcf]. i couldn't release my
feelings or my emotions the way i needed to or i wanted to...”

a patient said “it [icc] did nothing for me but piss me off
from the people that i wanted to get help from....if i'm getting
sectioned, and my family hasn't exhausted their options, ‘why

 

are you treating me like i should be locked up when i'm not
even doing the things to be locked up? i might as well go out
and do them because that's how you think of me. shit, now i'll
just go out and do them. what's to hold back?”

participants emphasized the need to use several methods to
and do them because that's how you think of me. shit, now i'll
just go out and do them. what's to hold back?”

participants emphasized the need to use several methods to
ensure that icc is not misused. these included thorough
assessments by knowledgeable professionals, urine testing to
verify reports of opioid use, multiple written statements from
people who know the patient in different capacities (family,
psychologist), and to not “serial section” patients who have had
poor outcomes from prior icc events. participants also made it
clear that icc should be used only as the “last resort” or “absolute
last tool,” after other treatment options have been exhausted.
a clinician said “i think some people [patients] are going to be
stable and because the mother, the father or whomever,
doesn't know the situation, they're [the family] going to
section them [patient], because they [the family] think that's
what's best, whether it's actually best or not.”

a patient said, “i resent my family so much because i got

a patient said, “i resent my family so much because i got
sectioned to a place with no medication, with my family not
even knowing all the options...they just thought that was their
only choice...had my family known other options... it would
have been so much better...if you go section someone, make
sure the family knows all the options...because it could really
screw the family up. i know you're doing it out of quote-
unquote ‘love’ [but]...love and suffering is a fine line.”

participants described how icc caused some patients to feel
betrayed or fearful of asking for help. in these situations, icc was
perceived to “divide families” and to exacerbate opioid use.

out of the house. they [the family] might call the cops and lie
and say that they're [the patient] being unsafe when they
weren't.”

 
 

in other instances, participants described how it was harmful
when icc was used unnecessarily or “prematurely,” for example
either to remove the person from the family or because the family
id not know about the actual nature of icc or lacked knowledge
about icc alternatives.

 
divides families

participants expressed concern that, in some cases, family used
icc with a harmful intent. participants described situations in
which icc was “abused” by angry or “spiteful” family members to
control or punish loved ones.
 

a cclinician said icc is “...this weird place that's between a legal
consequence and a treatment. and because of so many
negative experiences with the legal system and already
feeling they're not worth anything, or feeling their human
rights have been violated, i think that the experience of being

thrown in a jail cell is...a violation of human rights.”

a patient suggested that icc processes be altered to treat patients
with respect and dignity, saying “instead of a cop pulling up to
you and locking you up, have the recovery officers, have an ex-
addict, in that cruiser to guide you and show you what's going on
in your life...get to know that population, and don't treat them like

a third clinician said “i think for those that feel afraid, that
spend a portion of their time just environmental scanning,
they are unable to take anything else in, other than the shock
of where they are and how it happened.”

when asked to identify icc harms, two allies responded:
feels like jail, and often is a jail

participants indicated that the primary harm of icc is that it
places people with oud in settings that are run like jail.
participants further explained that, in fact, icc is sometimes
located inside an actual jail. these comments reflect, in part, that
many male commitments in massachusetts are to a facility that
previously served as an all-male minimum security prison and,
only until recently, women were civilly committed to state

prison. participants described the perceived and actual jail-like
settings of icc, along with the ways in which patients are brought
to them, as being “punitive,” “degrading,” “humiliating,” “terrible,”
“harrowing,” “isolating,” and “stigmatizing.” participants explained
that these aspects of icc caused patients to experience “fear” and
“shock” which thus functioned as a deterrent to recovery and
ultimately made a patient's reality worse.

teturned to opioid use.
promotes public health and increases public
safety

clinical staff noted that two other benefits of icc is that it can
promote public health and increase public safety. clinicians noted
that icc provides health services (e.g., assessments, diagnosis,
cand

 

education, medications) and thus helps to prevent hepati
other infectious diseases or connect people to treatment.
clinicians also believed that icc prevents crime by removing from
the community individuals whose substance use might increase
their risk for dangerousness towards others. clinicians cited these
as reasons why icc was worthwhile, even if patients later
returned to opioid use.
a clinician said “i think overall the benefit, or the hope, would
be that somebody gets sectioned, and either they're ready for
treatment then, or they get ready for treatment when they're
in the section. and they come out and their head is sort of
clearer. they can really commit to some kind of ongoing
treatment and get to the point where they're ready to live
their life.”

asecond clinician said “.

 

they are sectioned for a long
enough period of time, where their brain has the ability to
heal and make a clear decision at some point, then yes, it
[icc] can be really beneficial. because at that point, then ‘okay
yes, now i'm open to hearing your resources...i'm open to
hearing what you have to say.’ and then maybe at that point
they'd be willing to go and get treatment. i think that's a really
big positive, a-plus yes, that would be fantastic. does it

they'd be willing to go and get treatment. i think that's a really

work out that way most of the time? no.”

 
a patient explained “at least if you're able to come out [of icc]
and be clean, like then you have a sober mind to make that
decision you wouldn't want to go back to all that bullshit or
am i going to walk a different path this time... because of my

experience of my life...but it was the best thing that ever
happened to me. it got me clean and then when i got out...i
chose to stay clean because i'd got a little bit of hope there.”

an ally said, “...i know a lot of people that got out of there,
stayed clean, and that have been clean for years because...
that's a really eye-opening experience to say, ‘you know what?
i don't want to go through that again, i'm gonna really give it
a shot this time.”

another ally said “...from that section, you get the chance to
come out with a fresh start, not only being clean, but for
housing or programs or just starting fresh with everything:
your living circumstances, being clean, like the way your
relationships are with your family and everything else...you're
getting a complete fresh start when you are sectioned.”

can be a turning point event

participants noted that icc could be a turning point that changed
the course of their oud. in these cases, icc was described as an
event that enabled patients to think clearly, make a fresh start,
gain hope for the future, recover the ability to make decisions,
commit to “staying clean,” or engage in ongoing treatment.
despite these perceived benefits, participants also described how
icc was “the worst best thing,” that is, an experience that many
patients did not want to repeat (discussed further under harms).

a patient said, “i just wanted somewhere long term because i
had went to detox and then i left. i knew i would just leave
again, i knew myself. i keep leaving. i can't do this myself.”

a clinician recalled, “i had someone who wanted to be
sectioned [because] she didn't trust herself to not bounce [to
not leave treatment]...a lot of patients will say, ‘i know i'll
leave.’ ...and so when they get to a place of feeling helpless
enough, sometimes it's they'd rather just have someone force
them. because they can't do it themselves.”

another clinician said, “...it can be beneficial in those
patients that are kind of teetering like, ‘yes, i wanna get the
help but i can't stop and i don't know how,’ and it could be
that extra push for a longer term care that they might need.”
one patient explained “...sometimes it's hard to even get into
a place [treatment], so if someone goes and sections you, you
go right in.”

another patient said “that's why sectioning is good...you
have a bed no matter what...if you want to go to further
treatment, like you always have a bed there. like they don't
kick you out.”

a clinician explained, “...whoever did the sectioning felt like
there was no other option. because detox...you could end up
waiting a week or more. so, with a section, it just seems like
there's more urgency to it...after being sectioned, they're in
that facility for a longer amount of time. so in detox, it's only
a few days, maybe a week or two at most. but when
somebody is sectioned, they might be there up to a month.”

provides treatment access

participants reported that icc is a way to receive immediate
access to needed oud treatment, and for a longer period of time.
participants shared how community-based oud treatment was
not readily available, for example due to long waiting lists, overly
strict treatment policies, or lack of long-term care. in these
communities, icc was viewed as filling critical gaps in the oud
treatment system of care.

a patient reported that icc is “...recovery-based...it's like
rehab, just forced rehab but it's so much different [from jail].
it's way better.”

 
“better than overdose or jail”

besides preventing overdoses, another perceived benefit of icc is
that it enables people with oud who accept icc to avoid jail.
participants indicated that icc reduces future incarceration risks
because it provides access to treatment or can function as a
turning point event (detailed below). participants also shared that
icc was “better than overdose or j primarily because most jails
do not provide medications to treat oud.

 
one clinician said “...i've seen patients who have been
thankful that somebody in the family stepped in and did that.
not at first...they're not appreciative right off. they're very
angry...so it takes a while to subside, and for them to realize

thankful that somebody in the family stepped in and did that.
not at first...they're not appreciative right off. they're very
angry...so it takes a while to subside, and for them to realize
that people are doing it for the right reason.”

another clinician said “...i think in the end, they [patients
who were sectioned] probably realize that ‘yes, i was mad that
that was happening at that time.’ but understanding that
that...family member was doing that out of concern. it's not
meant to be a punishment.”

a third clinician explained that icc is more likely to have
better outcomes when the intent of the icc is “not malicious”
or “derogatory” but instead is “coming from a loving place, a
protective place.” this participant explained that if icc is “...
coming from a derogatory place, i think the chances of
overdose are really high...when they come from a loving place
they know that they're out of control, that has a different
thing to it. and so referrals, and the chances of follow-up are
much, much better in that population than someone who is
treated like ‘you dirty whatever'’...that's obviously not coming
from a loving place. that's to heavily more likely lead to

treated like ‘you dirty whatever'’...that's obviously not coming
from a loving place. that's going to heavily more likely lead to
suicidal ideations, suicidal gestures, maybe even overdose...”
best when used “for the right reasons”

clinicians observed that patients were thankful for icc, and that
there were likely to be better outcomes, when there was an
understanding that family and friends had acted “for the right
reasons,” i.e., out of concern and love, and not from anger, fear, or

desires to exact punishment.
a patient reported “...i was pissed when i got sectioned... but
by the time i left, i was so grateful that i was there because...
you need to come out of that cloud of using [drugs].”

another patient said “i was so mad [after icc], i was so
angry, i hated everybody, but it saved my life...after like about
30 to 35 days...and the more the drugs started leaving my
body and my psychiatric meds...started working, then i
started feeling better and thinking clearly...and i called my
mother and...i was like, ‘thank you for saving my life and i'm
so sorry.”

an ally talking about his own prior icc said “... for a long
time i never understood why my mom did what she did. and
she even went to the da and told the da to please not let me

helped them to come out from being under the influence of
substances and engage with treatment.
angry at first, grateful later

participants shared that at the time of an icc, patients commonly
became angry and confused, but developed feelings of gratitude
and thanks over time as patients came to understand that icc
helped them to come out from being under the influence of
substances and engage with treatment.
an ally recalled when he sectioned his sister, “...she looked like
she was on her last will. so i called my brothers up and i said,
‘hey, we could section her’ ...she was mad at the beginning
but then she didn't want to leave after being there like 90
days. so it's got benefits, especially when you love someone.
that's what sectioning is for, actually. some people say it's
wrong, some people say if you love the person you're going
to doit.”

a patient said “...i wish someone would have done it [icc]
for me. and it really says a lot that if someone is sectioned ...
there's somebody that loves and cares about you and that
you actually have someone that actually gives a shit.”

another staff member said, “...the patients i've had who
have been sectioned...[were] so severely intoxicated that their
family was scared and didn't know what to do with them
other than call the police and have them taken away...i think
for the most part it's [the family's motivation] safety.”

an ally speaking about his own icc experience reported “...
my mom and my stepdad had to play tough love...because i
had a little brother and...he already had seen a lot of stuff that
he shouldn't have seen as a kid. he was like traumatized...and
there's a lot of different parties that are involved when we
use...there's a lot of people that get affected by it
[addiction]...”

 

 
provides families with options

another perceived benefit of icc was its ability to empower family
and friends to keep their loved ones safe. participants talked
about how icc was “leverage” or an option that family could use
to remove a loved one with oud from the family and thus create

safety for siblings or others.
a patient reported about a friend, “the last time we sectioned
somebody it was my friend's mom and she'd been living
behind a grocery store and sucking dick to survive...she's got
mental health issues and that's one of her problems is she's
never going to make that next right decision. she needs that
help. and there's a lot of people that are like that. they just
get so drug down from living on the street, they're doing
things they're ashamed of that they don't even have the want
to not be high. they're just so hopeless.”

aclinician recalled about a patient, “i felt like [icc was
appropriate because] she was just really lost and would
wander the streets all the time, and wouldn't really stop doing
that...she was super lost...i just felt like other things
[alternatives to icc] had been exhausted.”

mixing other stuff, and...i didn't really feel that bad about it

that person was being sectioned at that time.”

a clinician stated “...i've seen people in the middle of an
addiction shooting up, and snorting, and rolling on the floor,
and completely out of it... [they] come out of it a little while
later, only to do it again...at that point, it's totally obvious that
they cannot make a good, informed decision.”

another clinician stated “...the changes in the brain, and the
memory loss and the impulsivity and the attention deficit and

they cannot make a good, informed decision.”

another clinician stated “...the changes in the brain, and the
memory loss and the impulsivity and the attention deficit and
the depression, all of these things that are the end result [of
addiction]...i think a lot of folks really live moment to moment
and can only really think about what they have to do today...
[addiction] erodes your forward thinking, your ability to
perceive things, manage problems...”

a third clinician said “i think it [icc] can be useful...if you
have a family member, and they're really engaging in high-
risk behavior, and they're in danger of killing themselves, or
even somebody else — if they're driving around like that, then
yeah. the family should have that [icc] option.”

other participants described situations in which oud had caused
individuals to be homeless or otherwise living in harmful
conditions. these conditions often led to feelings of desperation,
hopelessness, and despair that individuals with oud were unable
to change without the help offered by icc. in this context, icc was
perceived to be the only option to help individuals who were

hopelessness, and despair that individuals with oud were unable
to change without the help offered by icc. in this context, icc was

unable to help themselves.
 

a clinician said ” some cases, it [icc] is necessary. if
somebody is so messed up on a drug or a mixture of drugs
that they don't even know where they are, or they're being
violent or aggressive, or self-harming, yeah, it's a definite
need.”

another clinician said “...if [because of] their psychosis...
they're going to harm themselves or others, i think it's good
to section them, and then get them regulated with

to section them, and then get them regulated with
medication where they're not going to be harmful to
themselves or others.”

 

a patient reported “...i was very depressed...and i tried to
commit suicide. so my husband sectioned me.”

staff participants perceived patients in this state to be “illogical”
and unable to make “good” or competent decisions, and thus in
need of icc protections to avoid endangering themselves and
loved ones, and also people in the community.

others clarified that patients reach an out-of-control state due to
active opioid and poly-substance use or because of co-occurring
depression or other mental health disorders.

 
protects vulnerable patients who are out of
control and pose a danger to self or others
participants emphasized that icc is most appropriate for patients
who are “out of control” or have “lost touch with reality”. this state
was typically indicated by repeated non-fatal opioid overdoses
within a short time-period.
a patient stated “saving somebody's life, period, [that's] the
main thing.”
 

for example, a clinician explained that icc is appropriate “...
because it's [oud is] an immediate threat, [thus] immediate
action has to be taken to save their life.”

an ally said, “it [icc] could save your life at that particular
moment ... and get you out of a bad situation... it's best if you
get sectioned at that time because that could be your last
day.”

a patient stated “saving somebody's life, period, [that's] the
main thing.”
saves lives in the moment

participants overwhelmingly indicated the primary benefit of icc
its ability to save lives in the short-term. icc was described as a
tool for handling urgent and immediate life-threatening

 

situations.

benefits and harms of icc (alternatively called “section 35” or

implemented in a nondiscriminatory way, then (2) proponents
must decide if the expected benefits of icc outweigh the
identified harms. also, the framework states that public health
officials have an obligation to communicate with and involve
constituent communities, along with experts, to understand the
benefits and risks of strategies to address public health threats. in
this context, we solicited perspectives on the benefits and harms
of icc as perceived by three key stakeholder groups in
massachusetts, a top user of icc: patients being treated for oud;
nurses, physicians, counselors, and other clinical staff who treat
this population; and family and friends (i.e., allies) of patients with
oud. an over-arching goal was to generate findings on how to
use icc to address oud in ways that adequately balance
beneficence, autonomy, and non-maleficence.

 
from an ethical standpoint, icc is commonly justified because it
prevents opioid overdose, saving lives in the moment.»
problematic, however, is that icc abrogates individual liberty.

generalizability and mixed results. thus, it is unknown whether
icc improves or worsens future opioid overdose risks or has other

icc is intended to use judicial authority to place people with oud,
or other substance use disorders, who pose an imminent danger
to themselves or others in supervised residential settings where
they cannot obtain opioids. icc for substance use disorders may
also apply to outpatient commitments in certain jurisdictions. icc
is commonly invoked by family, but it can also be initiated by
friends, physicians, and others depending on the rules of the
applicable statute or jurisdiction. there is significant variation in
icc programming nationally, including the processes for
determining dangerousness or incapacitation, the burden of
proof required for issuing a ruling, where individuals are placed in
care, the type of treatment provided, and the duration of
confinement (from 24 hours to 12 months). also, the criteria for

abstract

involuntary civil commitment (icc) to treatment for opioid use
disorder (oud) prevents imminent overdose, but also restricts
autonomy and raises other ethical concerns. using the kass public
health ethics framework, we identified icc benefits and harms.
benefits include: protection of vulnerable, underserved patients;
reduced legal consequences; resources for families; and “on-
demand” treatment access. harms include: stigmatizing and
punitive experiences; heightened family conflict and social

 

reduced legal consequences; resources for families; and “on-
demand” treatment access. harms include: stigmatizing and
punitive experiences; heightened family conflict and social
isolation; eroded patient self-determination; limited or no
provision of oud medications; and long-term overdose risk. to
use icc ethically, it should be recognized as comprising vulnerable
patients worthy of added protections; be a last resort option;
utilize consensual, humanizing processes; provide medications
and other evidence-based-treatment; integrate with existing
healthcare systems; and demonstrate effective outcomes before
iffusion. icc to oud treatment carries significant potential
harms that, if unaddressed, may outweigh its benefits. findings
can inform innovations for ensuring that icc is used in an ethically
responsible way.
