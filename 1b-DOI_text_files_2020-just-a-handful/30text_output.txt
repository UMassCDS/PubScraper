discussion

the results of this study provide important insight in the role that traditional and
tech-mediated modes of communication play in young adult adoptees’ contact

biscussion

the results of this study provide important insight in the role that traditional and
tech-mediated modes of communication play in young adult adoptees’ contact
with their birth mothers and birth fathers. our findings suggest that young adult
adoptees are using a combination of both traditional and tech-mediated modes
in their communication with their birth parents. of those who had current contact
with their birth parents, the vast majority of participants reported using at least
one of each type of mode. however, use of these different modes varied
somewhat between birth mothers and birth fathers. a greater percentage of
young adults reported using tech-mediated modes of communication with their
birth mother than those who reported using these modes with their birth father.
furthermore, young adult adoptees also reported using a greater variety of
modes with their birth mothers than birth fathers. the most frequently used
modes of each type also differed for each birth parent. these differences may be
attributable to the larger number of young adults who had contact with their
birth mothers than with their birth fathers.

both traditional and tech-mediated modes of communication seem to play a role
in maintaining satisfying relationships. lower satisfaction with contact was
associated with desired increase of use of more traditional and tech-mediated
modes of communication with both birth mothers and birth fathers. this
suggests that those who are less satisfied with their current contact

arrangements may see both types of modes as providing opportu

modes of communication with both birth mothers and birth fathers. this
suggests that those who are less satisfied with their current contact
arrangements may see both types of modes as providing opportu
creating contact that is more satisfying. findings from nonadoptive families
suggest that traditional modes may be more closely associated with relationship
quality (ramsey et al., 2013). however, tech-mediated modes may provide
opportunities for adoptees to connect with birth parents in situations where
contact is less satisfying, such as when adoptees and birth parents live in different
geographic regions or when contact with birth parents is first being established
(whitesel & howard, 2013).

 

 
 

 

 

traditional modes of communication seemed to play a unique role in
participants’ relationships with their birth mothers. those who indicated that they
wanted higher levels of closeness with their birth mothers in the future also
dicated a desire to increase their use of traditional but not tech-mediated
modes. similarly, those who had greater psychological presence of their birth
mothers wanted increases in traditional but not tech-mediated modes. these
findings suggest that adult adoptees see traditional modes of communication as
potentially more useful for facilitating a close relationship with their birth mother.
these findings are in line with previous findings from nonadoptive families
suggesting that traditional modes of contact are uniquely related to relationship
quality (e.g., ramsey et al., 2013).

 

 

  

 

 

 

 

these findings are in line with previous findings from nonadoptive families
suggesting that traditional modes of contact are uniquely related to relationship
quality (e.g., ramsey et al., 2013).

 

 

findings for relationships with birth fathers did not show the same preference for
traditional modes of communication. those who wanted higher levels of future
closeness with and had greater psychological presence of their birth fathers also
reported wanting increases in the number of both traditional and tech-mediated
modes of communication. there are several possible interpretations of this
difference between birth mothers and birth fathers. for one, fewer participants
had current contact with their birth fathers. therefore, the preference for
traditional modes of communication seen in birth mothers may reflect a “dosage
effect” of sorts: participants may see tech-mediated modes of communication as
a way of developing greater closeness until a certain level of closeness has been
reached.

tech-mediated modes may be seen as allowing for a greater degree of emotional
distance as relationships are being formed. once a level of closeness has been
established, traditional modes of communication may be seen as more effective
in achieving greater closeness. this interpretation is supported by studies
suggesting that adopted persons think of tech-mediated communication as a less
invasive way of building a relationship after contact begins (whitesel &

howard, 2013). this interpretation is also supported by evidence that greater

suggesting that adopted persons think or tech-mediated communication as a less

invasive way of building a relationship after contact begins (whitesel &
howard, 2013). this interpretation is also supported by evidence that greater
smartphone and social media use may be negatively associated with well-being in
part by supplanting face-to-face social interactions (kushlev et al., 2019;

twenge, 2019). another potential explanation for this pattern of findings is that
adult adoptees have different expectations of their relationships with their birth
mothers and their birth fathers. this interpretation is supported by our finding
that adult adoptees reported greater desired future closeness with and
psychological presence of their birth mothers than with their birth fathers. if the
adoptee has different expectations of the two relationships, they may then have
different expectations of what communication should look like in those
relationships. in support of this interpretation, research on nonadoptive families
has also noted differences in patterns of tech-mediated communication between
mothers and fathers (connell & dworkin, 2012).

 

 

 

current closeness with birth mothers and birth fathers was not associated with
desired increases in use of either traditional or tech-mediated modes of
communication. in some ways, this finding is not all that surprising. it may be that
those who feel close to their birth parents are satisfied with their current
communication and do not wish to see changes in the future. in these cases, the
young adults and birth parents can be said to have successfully negotiated a
pattern of communication that results in an emotional distance that is

 

 

communication and do not wish to see changes in the future. in these cases, the
young adults and birth parents can be said to have successfully negotiated a
pattern of communication that results in an emotional distance that is
comfortable for the young adult.

limitations and future directions

the findings presented here provide valuable insight into adult adoptees’
perceptions of the roles traditional and tech-mediated communication play in
their relationships with their birth parents. however, it may be the case that these
perceptions do not map on to the actual correlation between either type of
communication mode on relationship quality. further work will be necessary to
elucidate the nature of this association. future work in this area should also
consider quality and frequency of use of different communication modes. in the
current study, participants were only asked whether they had used a particular
mode of communication in the past 2 years. it may be the case, however, that the
frequency of use of a given mode or the way in which it is used may be important
for relationship quality. for example, using text messaging to send holiday wishes
a few times a year may have different implications for closeness than using text
messages a few times a month to keep the other person updated on life events.

communication inherently involves more than one person, and thus it is
important for research in this area to include the perspectives of others involved

communication inherently involves more than one person, and thus it is
important for research in this area to include the perspectives of others involved
contact between adoptees and their birth parents. most important, future
research should include the perspectives of the birth parents themselves. in a
study on birth mothers as grandmothers, birth mothers reported using tech-
mediated communication to stay in contact with their adult placed child and their
grandchild(ren). however, the researchers noted that the adult adoptee
sometimes acted as a gatekeeper in the relationship, particularly in regard to
determining which modes of communication were used in the relationship
(wyman battalen et al., 2019). it will be important to understand from the birth
parents’ perspective how these negotiations about communication modes
between the adult adoptee and birth parents. other important perspectives to
incorporate into future work may include partners of both the adopted person
and birth parents, birth and adopted siblings, and adoptive parents. each of these
individuals are important parts of the extended adoptive family system and as
such may play important roles in communication between the adopted person
and birth parents.

 

while the increasing proliferation of tech-mediated modes of communication
offers many benefits to society, it also poses several challenges to researchers.
the questions used in this study asked participants about their use of all
prominent tech-mediated modes of communication at the time of data collection.

the questions used in this study asked participants about their use of all
prominent tech-mediated modes of communication at the time of data collection.
however, several new modes have gained prominence since then (e.g., snapchat,
instagram; anderson & jiang, 2018). as the landscape of tech-mediated
communication continues to change, new research should be conducted to
examine potential changes in its impact on contact between adoptees and birth
parents. in any case, technology use is here to stay, and those in the adoption
kinship network will continue using technology as a tool to navigate emotional
distance regulation in their relationships.

one strength of this study is that all participants have a relatively similar
experience of adoption in that all were adopted privately and domestically as
infants into same-race families. while this allows for a more thorough
examination of contact within that context, it may not necessarily be reflective of
the full range of adoptive experiences. for example, birth parent contact in the
context of private adoption does not carry the same challenges as birth parent
contact in the context of adoption through the child welfare system where the
adopted person may have experienced abuse or neglect. additionally, language
and cultural barriers to contact are not as prevalent in the domestic adoption
context as in the intercountry adoption context (for extended discussion of open
adoptions in different contexts, see grotevant, in press). future research should
therefore examine use of different communication modes in a greater variety of

context as in the intercountry adoption context (for extended discussion of open
adoptions in different contexts, see grotevant, in press). future research should
therefore examine use of different communication modes in a greater variety of
adoption contexts.

 

 

 

 

conclusion and implications

this study is among the first to examine adult adoptees' perspectives on the use
of both traditional and tech-mediated modes of communication in their contact
with their birth parents as well as associations with relationship quality. our
findings suggest that adult adoptees are using a combination of both traditional
and tech-mediated modes in their contact with their birth mothers and birth
fathers. however, patterns of mode use varied slightly between birth mothers
and birth fathers. those who were less satisfied with their current contact with
their birth fathers and birth mothers wanted to see increased use of more types
of both traditional and tech-mediated modes. on the other hand, findings for
future closeness and psychological presence suggest that adult adoptees view
traditional modes of communication as playing a unique role in their
relationships with their birth mothers. this pattern of results was not seen,
however, for relationships with birth fathers. family professionals who work with
members of the adoption kindship network should consider the unique roles
traditional and tech-mediated modes of communication may play when
supporting adult adoptees in contact with birth relatives.

responses from those participants who reported having current contact with
either their birth mother or birth father. frequencies of use of each mode of
communication reported on are presented in table 1. of the 60 participants who
had current contact with their birth mother, 90% (n = 54) reported using at least

(n = 46) reported using phone calls more than any other traditional mode. most
participants (91.7%; n = 55) reported using at least one tech-mediated mode in
their current contact with their birth mother. seventeen participants (28.3%)
reported using all six traditional modes. more participants (n = 43) reported using
text messaging more than any other tech-mediated mode. the most common
number of tech-mediated modes used was two (n = 20). almost all participants
(81.7%; n = 49) who had current contact with their birth mothers reported using
at least one traditional mode and at least one tech-mediated mode.

procedures

target adoptees who had previously participated in the larger longitudinal study
were invited to participate in the fourth wave of data collection. a series of
questionnaires were administered to participants online using qualtrics survey
software. participants were compensated for their time upon completion of the
surveys. all procedures were approved by the university of massachusetts
ambherst institutional review board.

measures

traditional and tech-mediated modes of communication

participants were asked to indicate which of 15 possible modes of communication
they used with their birth mother and birth father (separately) in the past 2 years.
nine of these 15 modes were classified as tech-mediated modes of
communication: email, text messaging, online chat, sending and receiving
messages on facebook, following the other person's facebook profile,
skype/video calls, twitter, a blog, and other social media. six of the 15 modes

 

communication: email, text messaging, online chat, sending and receiving
messages on facebook, following the other person's facebook profile,
skype/video calls, twitter, a blog, and other social media. six of the 15 modes
were classified as traditional modes of communication: phone calls, in-person
visits, exchanging gifts, letters, exchanging pictures, and sharing holidays
together. for each participant, counts of their total number of traditional and
total number of tech-mediated modes used with their birth mother and birth
father were calculated separately.

  

participants were also asked to report whether they would like to increase any of
the previously mentioned 15 modes of communication with either their birth
mother or birth father. total number of traditional and tech-mediated modes that
the participant desired to increase in the future was calculated for birth mothers
and birth fathers separately.

satisfaction with contact

satisfaction with contact was measured using participants' self-reported
satisfaction with their current contact arrangement with their birth mother and
birth father separately. satisfaction was rated on a scale ranging from 0 (very
dissatisfied) to 4 (very satisfied), with higher scores indicating greater levels of
satisfaction.

current and desired future closeness
dissatisfied) to 4 (very satisfied), with higher scores indicating greater levels of
satisfaction.

current and desired future closeness

current closeness with birth mother and birth father was measured using a single
self-report item that asked the participants to provide a rating on the closeness in
their relationship with their birth mother or birth father. similarly, desired future
closeness was measured using a single self-report item that asked participants to
indicate how close they would like their future relationship with their birth
mother or birth father to be. participant's responses to this item were measured
on a 10-point scale, with higher scores indicating greater levels of closeness.

psychological presence of birth parents

psychological presence of birth parents was measured using an item taken from
the adoption dynamics questionnaire (benson et al., 1994). the item used asked
participants to indicate how frequently they think about both their birth parent
on a scale ranging from never (1) to every day (7). participants responded to this
item for their birth mother and birth father, separately.
over the past decade, technology as a form of communication has become
increasingly common. given the increasing proliferation of tech-mediated modes
of communication (i.e., texting, social media), it is important to understand how
these communication modes may be associated with the quality of family
relationships. although family researchers have begun to examine the
implications of tech-mediated communication in traditional family structures
(e.g., connell & dworkin, 2012; ramsey et al., 2013), little research has examined
these implications in nontraditional families, such as adoptive families. the
present study aims to investigate how adult adoptees use traditional and tech-
mediated modes of communication in their contact with their birth mothers and
birth fathers. additionally, we examined relationships between having a desire for
increased use of traditional or tech-mediated modes of communication with
satisfaction with contact, current and desired future closeness, and psychological
presence (i.e., the symbolic presence of a person in one's life) of birth relatives.

emotional distance regulation

grotevant (2009) applied the concept of emotional distance regulation to our
understanding of how adoptive kinship networks navigate the complicated
process of establishing and maintaining mutually satisfying relationships.
although the context of adoption has evolved over the past several decades,
many adoptive families and birth families must find a way to establish an
extended kinship system in the absence of the kinds of cultural scripts for
appropriate interactions that many biological families rely on. adoptive and birth
family members, therefore, must build a consensus about the nature of their
relationship to each other and the birth family members’ involvement in the
adopted child's life. in other words, adoptive and birth families must negotiate a
degree of emotional distance (and conversely closeness) that is comfortable for
all parties involved. this is true even in the case of closed adoption where there is
no contact between the adoptive and birth families. the unfolding of this process
is influenced by characteristics each party brings to the table, such as their
expectations and levels of comfort with intimacy and interdependence
(grotevant, 2009). when the adopted person is young, the responsibility for
regulating this emotional distance falls to the adoptive parents. however, as the
adopted person moves through adolescence and into adulthood, more of the

responsibility for maintaining a relationship with the birth families falls to the

regulating this emotional distance falls to the adoptive parents. however, as the

adopted person moves through adolescence and into adulthood, more of the
responsibility for maintaining a relationship with the birth families falls to the
adopted person (dunbar et al., 2006; farr et al., 2013).

the introduction of tech-mediated modes of communication into our everyday
routines adds layers to the process of emotional distance regulation. the majority
of americans have integrated multiple tech-mediated platforms into their
everyday communication patterns (anderson & jiang, 2018; duggan et al., 2015).
the pew research center conducted a national survey regarding teens, social
media, and technology use and found that 95% of teenagers aged 13 to 17 own
or have access to a smartphone with 45% reporting that they are on the internet
almost constantly (anderson & jiang, 2018). the most frequently used social
media networks among teens included youtube (85%), instagram (72%), and
snapchat (69%; anderson & jiang, 2018). a 2015 study conducted by the pew
research center showed that texting was particularly common among teens, with
this age group sending and receiving a median of 30 texts each day (lenhart et
al., 2015). an earlier pew research study found text usage among teens (63%)
exceeds other forms of daily communication, including face-to-face socializing
outside of school (35%; lenhart, 2012).

online connectivity is not exclusive to teens and young adults. similar to use by
teens, adults had an increase in multiplatform use, with 52% of adults reporting
that they use the internet and two or more social media sites in 2014 compared
with 42% in 2013 (duggan et al., 2015). pew research conducted a study of adult
use of social media and technology and found that 67% of adults aged over 65
years use the internet (anderson & perrin, 2017). of american adults who use the
internet, more than 56% of adults aged 65 years and older use facebook, which is
about one third of all senior adults (duggan et al., 2015). because these
communication modes allow individuals to be in near constant contact with each
other despite physical distance, negotiating how frequently family members use
which modes of communication becomes an important part of emotional
distance regulation.

 

tech-mediated communication in
nonadoptive families

a growing body of research has begun to examine how tech-mediated
communication has shaped interactions between young adults and their family
members (most often their parents) within nonadoptive families. researchers
have consistently found that young adults use tech-mediated communication to
communicate with their parents, particularly after the young adults have left their
parents’ home. connell and dworkin (2012) found that approximately two thirds

   

have consistently found that young adults use tech-mediated communication to
communicate with their parents, particularly after the young adults have left their
parents’ home. connell and dworkin (2012) found that approximately two thirds
of college students reported communicating with their mother via text messaging
at least once a week; approximately one third reported communicating with their
father via text messaging at least once a week. smaller, although not insignificant,
percentages of college students reported communicating with their parents via
social networking sites, video chat, and instant messaging services. ramsey et

al. (2013) reported increases in text messaging and communication via social
media sites with parents among college students over 2 years, highlighting the
growing increase in tech-mediated communication within families.

 

 

although these findings suggest that tech-mediated communication between
young adults and their family members is common, other findings suggest that
the association between use of tech-mediated communication and relationship
quality is unclear. in one study of college students, ramsey et al. (2013) found
that the majority of college students reported using social media to communicate
with their parents, and about 90% reported that they used texting with their
parents. however, only phone calls with parents were associated with the quality
of the relationship. schon (2014) found that although the number of tech-
mediated modes used by parents and children to communicate with each other

tech-mediated communication with birth
families

research on the use of tech-mediated modes of communication in adoptive
families suggests that adopted persons and their parents are using various tech-
mediated modes to communicate with birth families. in one study of adoptive
parents, black et al. (2016) found that 30% of parents reported having active
communication with birth families through email, social media, and text
messaging, whereas 17% reported having passive communication (i.e., “following”
but not exchanging information) with birth families over social media. in a study
of young adult adoptees in open adoption arrangements, siegel (2012) found that
nine of 23 reported having contact with at least one birth family member through
e-mail, facebook, or text messaging. similarly, a report by the donaldson
adoption institute found that 61% of adult adoptees reported using the internet
to maintain contact with birth families (whitesel & howard, 2013).

little research has attempted to understand how tech-mediated communication
may be associated with the quality of the relationship between adopted adults
and their birth families. in their study on the internet and adoption, the
donaldson adoption institute found that many adopted adults reported that
using tech-mediated communication provided them with a means of maintaining
relationships with birth family members, particularly when distance was a barrier
to contact (whitesel & howard, 2013). participant responses also indicated that
adult adoptees viewed tech-mediated modes of communication as a tool for
regulating emotional distance when beginning relationships after initiating
contact; they reported that tech-mediated modes felt less invasive and emotional

 

   

than traditional modes of communication and therefore might feel more
comfortable when first building a relationship. some respondents, however,
noted that tech-mediated modes raised concerns about privacy when using social
media. in other words, social media may allow others to find and view your
information without your knowledge. a few studies that included the perspectives
of both adoptive parents and adopted adults (primarily within the united
kingdom) found that tech-mediated contact that was used as a supplement to
already established relationships with birth families helped to make contact feel
less formal and thereby normalize the adoptees’ dual connection with their birth
family (greenhow et al., 2016; neil et al., 2013; samuels, 2018).

study aims

the present study seeks to extend our understanding of how tech-mediated
communication shapes the quality of contact between adopted adults and their
birth families within the context of private domestic adoption. the first aim of this
study is to understand how young adult adoptees are using both tech-mediated
and traditional modes of communication in their communication with their birth
mothers and birth fathers. to accomplish this aim, we examine reports of young
adult adoptees who currently have contact with either their birth mother or birth
father regarding their recent communication.

 

the second aim is to understand how tech-mediated and traditional modes of
communication are associated with satisfaction with contact and relationship
quality. to accomplish this, we examined associations between young adult
adoptees’ desired increased use of either mode of communication with
satisfaction with contact with birth parents, current and desired future closeness
with birth parents, and psychological presence of the birth parents for all
participants. we chose to examine desired increase of each mode for several
reasons. for one, it allowed us to include those who may not have current contact

with birth parents, and psychological presence of the birth parents for all
participants. we chose to examine desired increase of each mode for several
reasons. for one, it allowed us to include those who may not have current contact
with their birth parents. furthermore, examining desired increased use may
provide insight into young adult adoptees’ expectations of the role each type of
communication plays in their relationships. for example, an association between
a desired increase in traditional modes of communication and lower satisfaction
with contact may indicate that those with lower satisfaction believe that using
more traditional modes of communication will increase their satisfaction.

  
  

   
implications

family professionals should consider the unique roles traditional and tech-
mediated modes of communication may play when supporting adult adoptees
in contact with birth relatives.
method

participants (mage = 31 years) were adopted as infants (n= 90). participants
reported their current and desired future use of traditional and tech-mediated
communication modes and their satisfaction with contact, current closeness,
desired future closeness, and psychological presence of birth parents.

results

those with current contact reported using both traditional and tech-mediated
modes of communication. desired increase of traditional modes was
associated with greater psychological presence and desired future closeness
with birth mothers, while both traditional and tech-mediated were associated
with these outcomes for birth fathers.

conclusion

adult adoptees use both traditional and tech-mediated modes of
communication with their birth parents. however, these modes may play
distinct roles in maintaining close relationships with birth parents.
