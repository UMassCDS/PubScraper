his study utilized research-grade and trace-level instrumentation to maximize the potential air
jality insights from the data through careful siting and sustained collection of high time-resolutic
ata. comparison of the r2pier site against a nearby regulatory monitoring site revealed

srrelation in measured pmz5 and bc. although teus increased and ship activity (vessel pings)
dd not markedly change, nta analysis indicated decreases of so2, no,, and bc associated wit

 

in situ monitoring data may be affected by sources outside the scope of the port authority's
ventory (e.g., emissions related to activities from privately-owned terminals).

s air monitoring rates increase with the evolution of air monitoring technology (e.g., snyder et a
013), retention and analysis of high time resolution air monitoring data may enable the isolation
local emission signals. coupled measurements of directly emitted pollutants and wind, along
ith monitor siting to minimize collinearity in sources, increases the likelihood of resolving
2ographic source emission areas influencing the measurements and gaining insight into the
ipacts of emission reduction efforts.
; conclusions
ocusing on the subset of trajectories that pass solely over nearby geographic areas associated
ith ship traffic and cargo handling, table 3 provides the change in concentration at the
onitoring site for on-source trajectories comparing the last 5 quarters of the study (july 1, 2014
ctober 1, 2015) to the first 5 quarters of the study (july 1, 2012-october 1, 2013). these longe
ne spans were selected to provide a significant volume of trajectories to assess temporal shifts
source emission areas over the study period and use identical spans of months to minimize
as due to seasonality. this analysis indicates a decrease of 34-41%, 11-17%, and 28-41% for
oz, no,, and bc, respectively, for air masses passing over three specific nearby source region
n important caveat to these findings is that the concentrations input to the nta analysis were
psolute values and not background-subtracted. while the influence of background seasonality
nould be lessened by using the same 15 months for the “before” and “after” time windows and
using on pollutants expected to be highly influenced by nearby emissions, additional research
| separate the background component from the time series would further refine these estimates

povebelow the average.

hroughout the study period, the monitoring station exhibited variation in hourly concentrations
‘g. 4). the coefficient of variation (cv) was calculated by computing the standard deviation of
hourly averages divided by the mean of the averages. the cv was highest for no (2.65),
lowed by sop (1.45), bc (1.21), pmz5 (0.79), nop (0.65), and co (0.60). in a near-source
nvironment, the high concentration excursions of directly emitted pollutants would likely be
lated to proximate emissions. to explore how the overall concentrations varied over time, as
ell as the occurrence of high concentration episodes, monthly percentiles (50", 75", and 95")
ere compared (fig. 5), normalized to their respective january-2013 concentration for ease of
sualization. bc stands out in having a slightly different seasonal signal in 2013, with higher
sncentrations in summer 2013 while other parameters had a local minima. for other periods, th

proximately 2 km to the southwest (latitude: 40.641440; longitude: -74.208365). whereas th

ethods, with bc measured optically and converted to a mass concentration, while ec is
easured through a thermal-optical method that separates organic and elemental carbonaceous

ethods in the new york city area observed moderate correlation but with slopes ranging from

cluding concatenating monthly files and removing any data flagged as associated with
libration checks. in total, the volume of minute-by-minute data approximated 1.7 million
pservation times over the 3+ years. for the gas-phase instruments, a secondary check was
snducted to flag any significant negative values (below ~2 ppb). in total, this led to a removal of
% of data points for so2, 0.0006% for no, and 0.009% for co. further, the black carbon data

ithheld from the analyses. these remaining negatives mostly corresponded to the timeframe
hen the bc monitor began exhibiting increased noise and needed repair, or rarely when a filter
range occurred before the onaatn threshold was reached. in addition, the pmz.5 sharp dat

nrrectly, causing disruption in sampling. this event primarily took place during january 2014.
fter visual inspection, a key indicator was a very low negative value reported by beta-attenuatio
jonitor (bam) component of the instrument. for periods when the bam reported a value below
d tug m-, two hours prior to this data point and 24 hours of data afterward were set to missing.
sa result, a total of 1.9% of the data were flagged and removed from analysis. after this initial
ocessing, data were imported and analyzed using r version 3.5.1, with packages including

rine vessel fuel sulfur content (kotchenruther, 2015). at a near-source scale, typically under
2veral km in distance from sources of interest, field study design often isolates a specific source
rough finding study locations that have minimal confounding sources in close proximity (e.g.
izzo et al., 2014). however, in locations such as a major port area, other transportation sources
often proximate to efficiently facilitate goods movement, complicating study design. when ail
onitoring and meteorological data are collected at a high time-resolution—on the order of one t
minutes in duration—a number of analytical strategies can be employed to isolate how neart
durces may affect the monitoring data, particularly for pollutants produced by direct emissions.
trategies used in past studies include a simple assessment of concentrations binned by wind
rection and speed, conditional probability functions relating wind direction and speed to
sncentration thresholds of interest (ashbaugh et al., 1985, uria-tellaetxe and carslaw, 2014) ai
onparametric trajectory analysis (nta) which extends beyond wind-directional analyses to
veal how surrounding geographic areas contribute to measured concentrations (henry, 2008;
enry et al., 2009; henry et al, 2011).

he study site of focus in this paper has, within a 10 km radius, a major port with multiple

y the state indicated emissions associated with the port were a cause for increased health risk
\jdep, 2009). while the report recommended an air monitoring study be conducted, it noted th
fficulty in connecting monitoring data with a particular source given the challenge of uniquely
entifying diesel exhaust associated with the port from confounding sources.

ithough the volume of teus at the port has increased sharply over time, a number of emission
duction activities have taken place. between 2012 and 2015, the port authority of new york ar
ew jersey's emissions inventories estimated reductions in fine particulate matter of 38% and
ductions in sulfur dioxide of 95%. emissions of nitrogen oxides were estimated to increase ove
same period by 2.4%. longer term trends showed substantial reduction in nitrogen oxides

notable cause of air emissions change was the designation of the north american emissions

    

placements. replacement of older trucks was also accelerated as a consequence of damage t

his paper describes a multi-year air monitoring study to observe air quality near the port during
is period of emissions transition. high time-resolution multipollutant and meteorology
easurements were conducted during the study timeframe, creating a very large data set that
jans several years and supporting the implementation of strategies such as nta to discern hov
durce emission areas impacted nearby monitoring site concentrations over time.

ranges to emissions is challenging given the geographic density of sources without unique
ollutant composition signatures. to better understand air quality during increasing emission
ontrols at the port of new york and new jersey (‘port’), an air monitoring station was sited to

rection, temperature, humidity). from summer 2014 to spring 2015, hourly metals data were
so collected. a high degree of temporal variability was observed for pollutants associated with
rect emissions, with highest hourly average coefficient of variation observed for no (2.65), so;
45) and bc (1.21). nonparametric trajectory analysis (nta) was utilized to separate the sourc
eas influencing the monitoring data and observe how they changed over time, with over 1.6
illion trajectories computed in total. comparing the last 5 quarters of the study to the first 5
uarters, concentrations at the monitoring site associated with three port-related geographic are
creased by 34-41%, 11-17%, and 28-41% for so, no,, and bc, respectively. over the sam
stiod, indicators of shipping and cargo activity at the port remained relatively constant; therefor
shift in emission factors is likely the cause of the change. this study demonstrates the value of
gh-time resolution, accurate monitoring data along with careful siting to understand source are
fluences.
