overall, our results shed new light on the visual processing
mechanisms involved in numerosity representation and the
related serial dependence effect modulating perceived
numerosity. our findings show that, first, serial dependence
operates on perceived rather than physical numerosity,
suggesting that it occurs at a perceptual level involving a
more refined, segmented, representation of sensory stimuli.
second, our results suggest that different stages of
feedforward activity presumably carrying low and high
spatial frequency information are sufficient to create a

feedforward activity presumably carrying low and high
spatial frequency information are sufficient to create a
numerosity representation in early visual areas. these results
thus provide a more comprehensive characterization of the
role of early visual processing in numerosity representation.

 

 

 
4. discussion

recent studies have highlighted several stages of numerosity
processing along the visual hierarchy, starting from early
occipital visual areas (v1-v3) to higher-order associative
areas in parietal cortex (castaldi etal., 2019; cavdaroglu etal.,
processing along the visual hierarchy, starting from early

tal visual areas (v1-v3) to higher-order associative

2015; cavdaroglu & knops, 2018; dewind etal., 2019;
fornaciai & park, 2018a; harvey etal., 2013; roggeman etal.,
2011; van rinsveld etal., 2020). in one of our previous studies
(fornaciai & park, 2018a), it was shown that a numerosity
representation is formed across two processing stages in
early visual areas (v2-v3): first, an early representation of
the raw, unsegmented visual items (around 100msec after
stimulus onset), followed by a more refined representation
reflecting segmented items forming the basis for numerosity
perception (around 150msec). the current study aimed to
distinguish two hypotheses considering the mechanisms of
these two stages: (1) they may reflect an initial feedforward
stage followed by later feedback signals consistent with
earlier studies concerning other forms of segmentation
(lamme, zipser, & spekreijse, 2002); or (2) they may reflect
two subsequent stages of feedforward activity carrying
different information - ie., first low-spatial frequency signals
(dots) carried by the faster magnocellular system, then high-

 

   

two subsequent stages of feedforward activity carrying
ifferent information - ic., first low-spatial frequency signals

spatial frequency signals (lines) carried by the slower
parvocellular system (jones & keck, 1978; maunsell & gibson,
1992; mazer etal., 2002). to this aim, we employed the
connectedness illusion, in conjunction with the serial
dependence effect and visual backward masking.

   

 

results from the no-mask condition first showed that the
serial dependence effect provides a bias to subsequent
stimuli based on the perceived, rather than veridical,
numerosity of the inducer. an 18 connected-dot inducer
caused a stronger underestimation of a 16-clot reference,
compared with the case of an 18-isolated-dot inducer (fig. 2b
and e). this result provides evidence that serial dependence
is not based on initial sensory representations and operates
on the basis of a more refined representation. in this case,
serial dependence occurs only after the stimulus is
segmented into a set of perceptual units closer to what the
participant is likely experiencing. interestingly, similar results

 

serial dependence occurs only after the stimulus is

adaptation, which has been shown to operate on perceived
rather than physical numerosity (fornaciai etal., 2016).

ilar results

   

while we expected and indeed observed attractive serial
dependence in the no-mask condition, our prediction
concerned an opposite, repulsive, effect in the mask
condition. in a previous study from our group (fornaciai &
park, 2019a), we have shown that when the awareness of the
inducer stimulus is suppressed by means of backward
masking, its effect on the subsequent stimulus becomes
repulsive. in other words, the perceived numerosity of the
reference gets pulled away from that of the inducer (i.e., a
lower-numerosity inducer causes overestimation, while a
higher-numerosity inducer causes underestimation) ~ an
effect akin to perceptual adaptation (kohn, 2007). this effect
has been taken as evidence for the involvement of conscious
high-level processing in establishing serial dependence. in
other wards when canscieupnrocessing.is suppressed py.
has been taken as evidence for the involvement of conscious
high-level processing in establishing serial dependence. in
other words, when conscious processing is suppressed by
masking, lower-level cortices would be “released” from the
attractive influence of serial dependence, allowing
spontaneous and automatic perceptual adaptation effects to
emerge. thus, when masking is applied in the context of the
present experiment to suppress feedback processing, the
influence of the inducer is expected to become repulsive.

results from the mask condition indeed showed a repulsive
aftereffect which, importantly, is still based on a reduced
numerosity due to connectedness (fig.2c and f). that is, an
18-connected-dot inducer compared with an 18-isolated-dot
inducer led to a relative overestimation of the reference
stimulus, consistent with a repulsive effect. first, this result
confirms that the masking procedure used here, which is
based on a preliminary test included in fornaciai and park
(2019a), is highly effective. very important in this
context, as the testing of our central hypothesis hinges upon
the ability of the mask stimulus to suppress the awareness
(2019a), is highly effective. this is very important in this
context, as the testing of our central hypothesis hinges upon
the ability of the mask stimulus to suppress the awareness
and feedback processing of the inducer. second, this result
shows that segmentation of “perceptual units” according to
item connectedness occurs irrespective of masking. this
suggests that feedback signals and re-entrant processing -
which are suppressed by backward masking (fahrenfort etal.,
2007) - are not strictly necessary for connectedness.
additionally, the results show that even awareness of the
stimulus is not required for this kind of segmentation,
suggesting that it likely reflects a perceptual organization
process occurring automatically and irrespective of other
related perceptual or cognitive processes. overall, the results
are more consistent with a feedforward account of
connectedness. in this account, an initial, rough numerosity
representation is first formed based on the feedforward low-
spatial frequency information carried by the faster
magnocellular pathway (jones & keck, 1978; maunsell &
gibson, 1992; mazer etal., 2002). later, such a representation
is refined by high-spatial frequency information carried by

 

 

 

magnocellular pathway (jones & keck, 1978; maunsell &
gibson, 1992; mazer etal., 2002). later, such a representation
is refined by high-spatial frequency information carried by
the slower parvocellular system, allowing to resolve the thin
lines connecting the dots and to correctly segment the set of
perceptual units. purely feedforward activity would thus be
sufficient to create a proper numerosity representation in
early visual areas, which is then fed to higher-order areas
such as parietal cortex for further processing. additionally,
these results also imply that a numerosity representation is
formed as soon as any visual information reaches the cortex,
but then progressively refined when finer information
becomes available.

while the present results are not consistent with the
feedback hypothesis, we cannot exclude the role of feedback
under normal stimulation conditions (e., without masking).
indeed, both feedback and feedforward processing could
contribute to the segmentation process. for instance, when
feedback signals are available, they may be exploited for the
purpose of segmenting composite objects like connected

  

contribute to the segmentation process. for instance, when
feedback signals are available, they may be exploited for the
purpose of segmenting composite objects like connected
dots; otherwise, if feedback processing is disrupted, the
image may be progressively refined using purely feedforward
information, perhaps in a less efficient fashion. our results
thus do not point to feedforward processing as the sole
responsibility for the perception of numerosity under the
connectedness illusion, but suggest that under peculiar
circumstances like masking, feedforward signals are
sufficient to represent a set of segmented objects.

the observation that stimulus connectedness is processed
despite the manipulation of backward masking has important
implications for our understanding of numerosity perception.
first, the present findings support the idea that numerosity
starts to be represented very early in the visual processing
stream (i.., in occipital areas such as v1, v2, and v3; e.g.,
dewind etal., 2019; fornaciai etal., 2017; park etal., 2016;
van rinsveld etal., 2020), and further show that the
construction of such representation does not require

van rinsveld etal., 2020), and further show that the
construction of such representation does not require
feedback from higher-order areas and conscious processing.
second, our results could inform the development of
computational models of numerosity processing. on the one
hand, our results are consistent with models of numerosity
processing such as the ones provided by dehaene and
changeux (1993) and verguts and fias (2004). in these
models, numerosity is extracted and represented throughout
a series of computational steps of increasing abstraction.
namely, the first step is an object-location map whereby
items are represented by foci of activity in a topographically-
organized map (consistent for instance with early visual
areas), which is followed by a summation stage summing up
the overall activity across the map, and finally a numerosity-
selective stage whereby units are selectively activated by a
specific numerosity. our results are also in line with the
model proposed by stoianov and zorzi (2012). this model,
after an initial unsupervised learning phase, has been shown
to be able to encode stimulus numerosity via relatively

after an initial unsupervised learning phase, has been shown
to be able to encode stimulus numerosity via relatively
simple computations occurring across two hierarchically
organized layers. however, models such as the one by
stoianov and zorzi (2012), as well as other models (e.g.,
morgan, raphael, tibber, & dakin, 2014), are essentially based
on spatial-frequency filters computing numerosity in terms
of high-spatial frequency energy (stoianov & zorzi, 2017).
considering that the lines connecting pairs of items most
likely increase the high-spatial frequency content of an array,
additional computations are thus needed to correctly extract
numerosities in more complex situations like in the presence
of connectedness. on the other hand, and in a similar vein,
our results are not consistent with frameworks of numerosity
processing based on continuous magnitudes (e.g., leibovich
etal., 2017). indeed, adding lines to a dot array effectively
increases the density of the stimulus and the area covered by
the items in the array, predicting an increase, rather than a
decrease, in perceived numerosity. differently from these
models, our results suggest that even at the earliest levels of

decrease, in perceived numerosity. differently from these
models, our results suggest that even at the earliest levels of
numerosity processing (fornaciai & park, 2018a) and during
the ini , the representation is already
based on “perceptual units” defined by connectedness, rather
than by other stimulus statistics like density or high-spatial
frequency content, which represents an important factor that
should be taken into account in the development of future
models of numerosity perception.

 

feedforward acti

 

from a computational point of view, however, what are the
specific neural operations that may explain the present
results? considering the model proposed by dehaene and
changeux (1993), the effect of connectedness would most
likely occur at the stage of the low-level object location map.
namely, while independent activation loci (as caused by
isolated dots) would lead to a linear summation of their
respective activity, the presence of a connection between
them might drive an additional “normalization” process
resulting in a sub-additive integration. in this scenario, the
relation between different foci of activity across the object
them might drive an additional “normalization” process
resulting in a sub-additive integration. in this scenario, the
relation between different foci of activity across the object
location map would thus modulate the overall activity across
the map itself, leading to a biased read-out of numerosity at
the subsequent stages. although speculative, this
interpretation is consistent with a previous study from our
group (fornaciai & park, 2017b), in which we exploited
motion to address the properties of low-level numerosity
processing (see also fornaciai, togoli, & arrighi, 2018).
namely, the results from this previous study (fornaciai &
park, 2017b) show that while the numerosity of dots
randomly changing position over time at a relatively fast
frequency (2-8hz) is markedly overestimated, such an effect
is significantly reduced if the dots move instead along a
coherent linear motion trajectory. in other words, while the
additional activity elicited by a dot displaced to a different
position seems to be integrated into the final estimate of
numerosity, the streak of activity elicited by a linearly
moving dot is normalized to reduce this potential
overestimation, like a sort of “connectedness” over time

  

numerosity, the streak of activity elicited by a linearly
moving dot is normalized to reduce this potential
overestimation, like a sort of “connectedness” over time
(rather than in space). the present results thus additionally
suggest that while these normalization computations require
more time compared to a less refined initial representation
(fornaciai & park, 2018b), they are likely performed locally at
the level of the putative object location map (i.e., for instance
in early visual areas such as v1-v3), without the need for
higher-level computations fed back from downstream
processing stages.

 

finally, a word of caution is in order when evaluating the
effect size observed in the no mask and mask conditions of
the serial dependence experiment. while some of the effect
sizes seem relatively small, this has been expected given the
parameters and the constraints in those parameters in our
experimental design. indeed, both the attractive serial
dependence effect and the mask-induced repulsive effect
have been shown to be relatively small even in experimental
designs aimed to maximize them (fornaciai & park, 2019a).
dependence effect and the mask-induced repulsive effect
have been shown to be relatively small even in experimental
designs aimed to maximize them (fornaciai & park, 2019a).
here, the effect is further constrained by the choice of the
inducer numerosity, which had to be balanced in order for
connectedness to bring it (perceptually) below the reference
numerosity. additional variability to the effect is also
introduced by the connectedness effect itself, which is
expected to vary from trial to trial. furthermore, the masking
procedure introduces further constraints in terms of timing
and strength of the stimuli, which were optimized to
effectively suppress the awareness of the inducer stimulus.
considering these factors, a relatively small effect size is the
expected outcome of the present experimental design, and a
stronger effect would be rather unrealistic. finally, the crucial
test of our central hypothesis concerns the difference
between the effects observed with the unmasked inducer and
the masked inducer, which yielded a moderate effect size
(fig.3). considering the effect size of the difference between
conditions (d=.71), we also performed a post-hoc power
analysis to assess the power achieved with our experimental

 

 

 

 

 

(fig.3). considering the effect size of the difference between
conditions (d=.71), we also performed a post-hoc power
analysis to assess the power achieved with our experimental
design. to this purpose, we considered an a=.05, a two-tailed
distribution, and our sample of 45 subjects. this analysis
resulted in an estimated achieved power of 99%, further
suggesting that our conclusions are founded on reliable
evidence.
finally, we directly compared the effect of inducers in the
two different conditions (mask versus no mask) using the
normalized serial dependence effect index (see section 2.4),
as it was the critical measure for our central hypothesis about
whether or not masked inducers (or abolishing feedback
signals) yield the same serial dependence outcomes as the
unmasked inducers (fig. 3). the effect of serial dependence in
the two conditions was significantly different (t(44)=3.04,
p=.0039, d=.71) and in opposite directions, reflecting the
attractive and repulsive nature of the bias in each of the two
conditions.

however mostly due to the large difference in pse, as jnds
were very similar across the two conditions, as also suggested
by the similar slope of the average psychometric curves in

respectively for the isolated and connected-dot condition;
paired t-test, t(44)=.44, p=.66).

 

 

 

 

in the second experiment, the connected and isolated 18-dot
arrays induced serial dependence, affecting a subsequent 16-
dot reference stimulus. similar to the previous connectedness
experiment, participants performed a numerosity
discrimination task, this time comparing a 16-dot reference
(always containing isolated dots) with a variable probe.
crucially, the inducer was presented before the reference in
the same spatial position. considering the underestimation of
connected dot arrays (fig.2d), if serial dependence operates
on veridical numerosity, then whether or not the inducer to a

connected dot arrays (fig.2d), if serial dependence operates
on veridical numerosity, then whether or not the inducer to a
16-dot reference contains 18 isolated dots or 18 connected
dots should not affect the perception of the 16-dot reference.
if serial dependence operates on perceived numerosity, then
the perceived numerosity of the 16-dot reference would be
influenced by whether or not the inducer contains 18 isolated
dots or 18 connected dots.

in the no-mask condition, we observed a clear attractive
serial dependence effect, as shown by the leftward shift in
the average psychometric curve relative to the connected-dot
inducer (fig.2b, blue curve), and by the difference in average
pse (fig. 2e). namely, the 18-connected-dots inducer caused a
small but noticeable underestimation of the reference
stimulus compared to the isolated-dot inducer (average
pse£sd=15.7+1.2 and 15.3+1.4, respectively for the isolated
and connected-dot inducer). this effect was statistically
significant (paired t-test, t(44)=2.17, p=.035), though with a
relatively small effect size (d=.32). importantly, such an

connectedness), rather than its veridical numerosity.

 

due to

 

then, we used visual backward masking to suppress the re-
entrant processing of the inducer making it invisible. the
predictions of this condition are as follows: if connectedness,
giving rise to the perceptual units of numerosity perception,
relies on re-entrant processing enabled by feedback signals,
masking should abolish the connectedness effect. in this
scenario, we should expect no difference between the two
inducer conditions, or even an underestimation in the

 

 

connected-dot-inducer condition due to the additional
presence of lines. conversely, if connectedness does not rely
on feedback signals, then the connected-dot-inducer should
provide an effect based on a reduced numerosity. in this
scenario, we should expect a repulsive aftereffect following
our previous findings (fornaciai & park, 2019a): an isolated
inducer (which is perceived to be relatively more numerous)

 

scenario, we should expect a repulsive aftereffect following
our previous findings (fornaciai & park, 2019a): an isolated
inducer (which is perceived to be relatively more numerous)
would lead to an underestimation of the reference array
while a connected inducer (which is perceived to be
relatively less numerous) would lead to an overestimation of
the reference array. the results (fig.2c) were consistent with
the second hypothesis: the connected-dot inducer caused a
systematic overestimation of the reference numerosity,
relative to the isolated-dot inducer (average
pse£sd=15.5+1.5 and 15.9.6, respectively for the isolated
and connected-dot inducer). this pattern is consistent with a
repulsive effect based on the “perceived” numerosity of the
inducer reduced by connectedness. the difference between
the two inducer conditions was statistically sig,

the study was divided into two different experiments (see
fig.1). in the first experiment, we measured the
connectedness effect (franconeri etal., 2009; he etal., 2009)
using a numerosity discrimination task. the purpose of this
preliminary experiment was to assess how such pairwise-
connected dot arrays are perceived in order to use them as
inducers in the following serial dependence experiment. the
results (fig.2a and d), in line with previous studies,
confirmed a strong underestimation of perceived numerosity
of pairwise-connected arrays. looking at the average
psychometric curves, there is a robust leftward shift of the
curve relative to the connected-dot reference condition,
indexing a strong underestimation of connected dots. pses
across the group in the connected-dot condition were indeed
significantly smaller than pses corresponding to the same
amount of isolated dots (fig.2d; t(44)=10.15, p<.001, cohen's

effectsd) 26%+17% compared to isolated dots (average
pse£sd=17.7+19 and 12.9428, respectively for the isolated
and connected-dot condition). this reduction appears
roughly in line with previous studies employing a similar
procedure, although the magnitude of bias is stronger in the
current study (~20% reduction in fornaciai etal., 2016; ~19%
reduction in the 16-dots condition in fornaciai & park,
2018a). although anecdotal, this is in line with the idea that
the strength of the connectedness illusion is inversely related
to the duration of the stimuli (he etal., 2009), which in the
present study was much shorter (i.e., 50msec in the current
study versus 150msec in previous studies from our group).

2.4. behavioral data analysis

performance in the numerosity discrimination task was
analyzed separately for each subject and condition, in order
to characterize the connectedness effect and the serial
dependence effect induced by isolated or connected stimuli.
to achieve a measure of participants’ accuracy and preci
in the task, the distribution of response probabilities as a
function of probe numerosity was fitted with a cumulative
gaussian curve, according to the maximum likelihood
method (watson, 1979). the point of subjective equality (pse;
the probe numerosity perceptually matching the reference
numerosity), reflecting the accuracy in the task (i.e., the
reference perceived numerosity), was defined as the median
of the best-fitting cumulative gaussian curve. the just-
noticeable difference (jnd), the difference in numerosity
between chance level (50%) responses and 75% “probe more
numerous" responses, was taken as a measure of precision in
the task. as an additional measure of precision, we computed
the weber's fraction (jnd/pse), which was used to evaluate
numerous" responses, was taken as a measure of precision in
the task. as an additional measure of precision, we computed
the weber's fraction (jnd/pse), which was used to evaluate
the participants’ performance in the task and to exclude
subjects showing insufficient performance. during the fitting
procedure, we also applied a finger error (or lapse) rate
correction (2%; wichmann & hill, 2001), to account for
random errors independent from the stimulus magnitude
and lapses of attention. such a correction involves the
adoption of slightly narrower theoretical bounds of response
probabilities during the psychometric fitting, which, with a
2% correction, will be from .02 to .98, instead of from 0 to 1.
doing so, we take into account random errors and lapses of
attention which may prevent the cumulative gaussian fit to
converge to 0 and 1at the extremes of the probe numerosity
range. finally, paired t-tests on pses were used to test the
ifference between pairs of conditions, in order to assess the
connectedness and serial dependence effects. to exclude
participants showing poor performance, we used the wf and
computed a cut-off based on the interquartile range. namely,
we log-scaled wfs in each condition of the serial dependence

 

 

 

participants showing poor performance, we used the wf and
computed a cut-off based on the interquartile range. namely,
we log-scaled wfs in each condition of the serial dependence
experiment and computed the third quartile (q3) and the
interquartile range of the data (iqr). the cut-off was thus
defined as q3 + 1.5xiqr. any participant showing wf higher
than this cut-off in any of the serial dependence conditions
was excluded. this criterion led to the exclusion of three
participants. additionally, participants were excluded also
based on reaction times. outlying participants were excluded
based on the identical procedure used for wfs. this led to the
exclusion of three more participants with very slow reaction
times, leaving a total of 45 subjects in the final group. note
that the exclusion criteria were evaluated and applied only
based on the data from the serial dependence experiment, as
it represents the main experiment for the aims of the present
study.

  

 

besides the analysis based on pse, we also computed a
normalized serial dependence effect index according to the
following formula:

besides tne analysis based on fe, we also computed a
normalized serial dependence effect index according to the
following formula:

serial dependence index = ((pseiso — pseconn) /psecon

where pseiso indicates the pse obtained with the isolated-
dot inducer, and pseconn indicates the pse obtained with the
connected-dot inducer. we calculated such serial dependence
index individually, and compared the indexes obtained in the
no mask and mask condition with a paired t-test. in this
context, a positive index indicates an attractive effect
whereby the presence of a connected-dot inducer leads to a
relative underestimation of the reference stimulus, compared
to when an isolated-dot inducer is presented. conversely, a
negative index indicates a repulsive effect whereby the
presence of the connected-dot inducer leads to an
overestimation compared to the isolated-dot inducer
condition. a similar normalized effect was also calculated for
the connectedness effect.

the inducer stimulus (soa=65msec) in order to make the
stimulus invisible and suppress re-entrant processing. in both
cases, to avoid confusion between reference/probe stimuli
and the inducer, a cue (orange fixation cross) was presented
before the onset of the reference and throughout the
presentation of the stimuli. stimuli are not depicted in scale.

2.2. apparatus and stimuli

visual stimuli across the two experiments were generated
using the psychophysics toolbox (brainard, 1997; kleiner
etal., 2007; pelli, 1997) for matlab (version 12016b; the
mathworks, inc.). stimuli were presented on a 1920x 1080
pixel monitor screen (144hz), encompassing approximately
35x20 degrees of visual angle from a viewing distance of
about 80cm.

stimuli were visual arrays of black and white dots (50% and
50% in most of the cases; in case of odd numerosities the
color of the exceeding dot was randomly selected) presented
on a gray background. the parameters of the dot-array
stimuli were chosen to range equally in three orthogonal
dimensions, corresponding to numerosity (n), size (sz), and
ara maydackyrounas tie parancrers or rie votatay
stimuli were chosen to range equally in three orthogonal
dimensions, corresponding to numerosity (n), size (sz), and
spacing (sp). such a stimulus construction scheme was
employed to ensure consistency with previous work from our
group (eg., fornaciai & park, 2018c; 2019a), and thus to
ensure that the present results could be easily compared with
previous findings. however, since the primary goal of the
study concerns numerosity, the different levels of non-
numerical dimensions were collapsed together during data
analysis. for a more detailed description of the stimulus
construction procedure and a characterization of the effect of
non-numerical dimensions, see dewind, adams, platt, &
brannon, 2015; park etal., 2016. specifically, the parameters
of the stimuli were set as follows. the area of each individual
dot ranged from 113 pixel? (.038 deg”), equal to a diameter of
.11 deg (6 pixels), to 452 pixel? (.15 deg”), equal to a diameter
of .22 deg (12 pixel). the field area of the stimuli (ie., the
circular area within which the dots were located) ranged
from 70,686 pixel? (23.9 deg?), encompassing 5.5 degrees of
visual angle in diameter (300 pixels), to 282,743 pixel? (95.7

from 70,686 pixel? (23.9 deg?), encompassing 5.5 degrees of
visual angle in diameter (300 pixels), to 282,743 pixel? (95.7
deg?), encompassing 11° in diameter (600 pixels). in all cases,
the individual size of the dots was homogeneous within the
stimulus, and we set a minimum distance between any two
dots equal to at least the radius of the dots. regarding
numerosity, in the preliminary connectedness experiment
the reference stimulus always contained 18 dots, while the
probe stimulus contained a variable number of dots from trial
to trial (8, 10, 13, 16, 20, 25, 32). in half of the trials, the dots
in the reference stimulus were pairwise connected with lines
(width=2 pixels). dot positions were calculated offline
computing a set of coordinates compatible with pairwise
connections in order to avoid crossing between lines or
superimposition between lines and dots. the same offline
procedure was applied for both the reference and probe
stimuli in order to keep the low-level properties of the
images (which are affected by the constraining presence of
lines) similar. in the serial dependence experiment, the
stimuli included a task-irrelevant inducer, including 18 dots,

stimuli included a task-irrelevant inducer, including 18 dots,
either isolated or connected, a reference including 16 isolated
dots, and a variable probe containing 8-32 isolated dots. in all
cases, dot positions were calculated offline in order to
compute coordinates compatible with connecting lines,
similarly to the connectedness experiment. for each
numerosity, a set of 1,000 arrays was created and stimuli
were randomly drawn from these sets during the experiment.
note that reference and probe numerosities were chosen to
be in line with our previous work (e.g., fornaciai & park,
2018c; 2019a), which allows a direct comparison between the
results across different studies when needed.

in addition, in some of the conditions a mask stimulus was
briefly presented after the inducer stimulus (65msec after
inducer onset). the timing of the mask stimulus was chosen
according to a previous study using very similar stimuli
(fornaciai & park, 2019a). the mask stimulus was a
black/white square-pattern mask (side of each square=22

). presented through a ilar aperture (12 deg)

     

(fornaciai & park, 2019a). the mask stimulus was a
black/white square-pattern mask (side of each square=22
ixel), presented through a circular aperture (radius=5.7 deg)
in the same position of the inducer stimulus.

 

2.3. general procedure

all experimental conditions were performed in a quiet and
imly lit room, with participants sitting in front of a monitor
screen at a distance of about 80cm. each participant
performed the connectedness experiment followed by the
serial dependence experiment. in the connectedness
experiment (fig. 1a), we measured the connectedness effect
using a previous procedure (fornaciai & park, 2018a). namely,
in each trial a sequence of a reference (18 dots, either isolated
or connected) and a probe (8-32 isolated dots) stimulus was
presented on the screen, either on the left or the right of a
central fixation point (eccentricity=9.2 deg; positions
randomized across trials). the two stimuli were separated by
a variable interstimulus interval (500-600msec), and their
order was randomized from trial to trial. at the end of the

 

 

randomized across trials): the two stimuli ‘were separated by
a variable interstimulus interval (500-g00msec), and their
order was randomized from trial to trial. at the end of the
trial, participants were asked to report which stimulus
contained more dots by pressing the appropriate key on a
standard keyboard. after providing a response, the next trial
started automatically after 950-1,150msec. additionally,
participants were instructed to focus exclusively on the
number of dots. in the second experiment (fig. 1b), we
measured serial dependence effects induced by isolated or
connected dot arrays, either visible or made invisible by
visual backward masking. in the “no-mask" cond
sequence of three stimuli was presented in each trial, either
on the right or on the left of a central fixation point
(eccentricity-9.2 deg; position randomized across trials).
first, an inducer array containing 18 dots, either isolated or
connected, followed by a reference stimulus (16 dots) after
600-900msec, and finally a probe stimulus (8-32 dots)
following the reference after 500-600msec. all stimuli were
presented on the screen for approximately 50msec, and
always in the same order. in the “mask” condition, a pattern

following the reference after 500-g00msec. all stimuli were
presented on the screen for approximately 50msec, and
always in the same order. in the “mask” condition, a pattern
mask was presented for 50msec shortly after the inducer
(soa=65 msec) to induce masking. with the exception of the
mask, the sequence and the other stimuli were identical to
the no-mask condition, and both conditions were randomly
intermixed within the same block. at the end of each trial,
participants were instructed to report whether the reference
or the probe stimulus contained more dots as fast as they
could. participants were told that although the inducer (and
the mask) were irrelevant for the task, they should attend to
the entire sequence of the stimuli. in the serial dependence
experiment, to avoid confusion between reference/probe
stimuli and the inducer, a cue (orange fixation cross) was
presented before the onset of the reference and throughout
the presentation of the stimuli. subjects were told that the
cue indicates when the task-relevant stimuli will be
presented. the connectedness experiment comprised 4
blocks of 56 trials, while the serial dependence experiment

blocks of 56 trials, while the serial dependence experiment

experiment, participants completed a brief training session
(8-15 trials) to familiarize with the task and ensure that they
understood the instructions. participants were allowed to

 

take breaks during the experiment, and an entire session took
about 45min, note that while in the connectedness
experiment, the order of stimuli was randomized from trial

to trial to avoid time-order errors (i.e., under- or
overestimation of the first stimulus in the sequence), the
sequence of stimuli was fixed in the serial dependence
experiment in order to always have the reference following
the inducer. this is important as serial dependence is
stronger on the immediately successive stimulus (fornaciai &
park, 2020b). however, presenting both reference and probe
stimuli in the same position as the inducer might cause serial
dependence to also affect the probe, possibly reducing the
magnitude of the bias. we nevertheless chose this
stimulation procedure as it has proven to be effective in
previous studies (fornaciai & park, 2018c, 2019a, 2019b,

manipulations which are instead necessary when the stimuli
are presented in different positions (fornaciai & park, 2018c).
additionally, we chose a peripheral stimulus presentation, as
opposed to a central presentation, to increase the
effectiveness of the masking procedure in the mask condition
(stewart & purcell, 1970). to keep the stimulation procedure
consistent across conditions, we used the same peripheral
stimulus presentation in all the experimental conditions
tested in the study.

criteria, whether inclusion/exclusion criteria were
established prior to data analysis, all manipulations, and all
measures in the study.
1. introduction

approximate numerical magnitude - or simply numerosity -
represents a fundamental attribute of a visual scene (e.g.,
anobile, cicchini, & burr, 2016). humans, as well as many
other animal species, are thought to possess a natural sense
of number that allows them to rapidly estimate the
approximate number of objects in a visual scene (agrillo,
dadda, serena, & bisazza, 2008; dehaene, 2011; gallistel &
gelman, 1992; pepperberg, 2006; piantadosi & cantlon, 2017;
rugani, vallortigara, priftis, & regolin, 2015). this sense of
number appears to be phylogenetically ancient, and
ontologically innate, as human newborns are able to
discriminate the numerosity of different sets shortly after
irth (izard, san, spelke, & streri, 2009; xu, 2003; xu &
spelke, 2000). similarly to many other

h (izard, sann, spelke, & streri, 2009; xu, 2003; xu &
spelke, 2000). similarly to many other visual features like
orientation, color, or motion, numerosity has been shown to
be subject to adaptation (e.g., burr & ross, 2008), suggesting
that it is a primary visual attribute fundamental to construct
an accurate representation of a visual scene (e.g., anobile,
cicchini, & burr, 2016; cicchini, anobile, & burr, 2016). several
studies suggest that numerosity processing may exploit
dedicated brain mechanisms independent of other
continuous magnitudes like density (anobile, cicchini, & burt,
2016; park, dewind, woldorff, & brannon, 2016; van rinsveld
etal., 2020) creating an abstract representation shared across
multiple sensory modalities (arrighi, togoli, & burr, 2014;
togoli, marlair, collignon, arrighi, & crollen, 2021), and across
the perceptual and motor systems (anobile, arrighi, togoli, &
burr, 2016; anobile, domenici, togoli, burt, & arrighi, 2019;
togoli, crollen, arrighi, & collignon, 2020) at their highest
level, while other authors have suggested that numerosity is

perceived via the representation of continuous magnitudes,
such as density (dakin, tibber, greenwood, kingdom, &
morgan, 2011; durgin, 1995, 2008; leibovich, katzin, harel, &
henik, 2017).

one important question regarding the mechanisms
underlying numerosity perception concerns the specific
visual pathway leading to numerosity representation. the
brain region most often associated with numerosity
perception is the parietal cortex and, more specifically, the
intraparietal sulcus (ips; piazza, izard, pinel, le bihan, &
dehaene, 2004), or the superior parietal lobule (spl; harvey,
klein, petridou, & dumoulin, 2013). the parietal cortex has
been shown to contain topographic maps of numerosity
(harvey etal., 2013) and since it represents different
numerical formats (i.e., symbolic and non-symbolic; piazza,
pinel, le bihan, & dehaene, 2007), it may be the locus where
an abstract representation of quantity is formed (anobile,
arrighi, etal., 2016; arrighi etal., 2014; but see cavdaroglu &
knops, 2018 for evidence against a format-independent
lepresentation) several secant studigs, hawener, statted.to
arrighi, etal., 2016; arrighi etal., 2014; but see cavdaroglu &
knops, 2018 for evidence against a format-independent
representation). several recent studies, however, started to
report numerosity-related activity in early sensory cortices in
both the visual (castaldi, piazza, dehaene, vignaud, & eger,
2019; cavdaroglu & knops, 2018; dewind, park, woldorff, &
brannon, 2019; fornaciai & park, 2018a; harvey & dumoulin,
2017; roggeman, santens, fias, & verguts, 2011; van rinsveld
etal., 2020) and auditory (cavdaroglu, katz, & knops, 2015)
modality. in the visual modality, there is evidence that
numerosity representations are formed throughout multiple
processing stages (fornaciai & park, 2018a; park etal., 2016;
roggeman etal., 2011), as predicted by computational models
of numerosity perception (dehaene & changeux, 1993;
stoianov & zorzi, 2012; verguts & fias, 2004).

 

in particular, studies exploiting the high temporal resolution
of electroencephalography (eeg) show different processing
stages representing numerosity, starting at extremely short
latencies after the onset of a stimulus. for instance, park etal.
(2016) first showed number-sensitive activity at around
stages representing numerosity, starting at extremely short
latencies after the onset of a stimulus. for instance, park etal.
(2016) first showed number-sensitive activity at around
75msec after stimulus onset, followed by another stage
around 180msec. subsequent studies found that the earliest
activity likely arises from areas such as v2 and v3 (fornaciai,
brannon, woldorff, & park, 2017), and that an early
processing stage is present also for numerosities in different
ranges (ie., very low numero:
items, known as the “subitizing” range, and very high
numerosities whereby individual items can no longer be
istinguished as in a texture pattern; see anobile, cicchini, &
burt, 2016 for a review), although with weaker sensitivity to
numerical information (fornaciai & park, 2017a).

 

ies around or less than four

 

 

although these studies demonstrate the involvement of early
visual activity in numerosity representation, the role of such
a processing stage is less clear. in a recent work (fornaciai &
park, 2018a), we asked whether early visual activity is
sufficient to explain the representation of numerosity, or
whether it merely reflects an initial stage where a proper
park, 20184), we asked whether early visual activity is '“*
sufficient to explain the representation of numerosity, or
whether it merely reflects an initial stage where a proper
representation is not yet formed. to do so, we employed the
connectedness illusion — that is, a systematic bias whereby
the numerosity of pairwise-connected dot arrays is
consistently underestimated. the connectedness illusion is
thought to reflect the segmentation processes needed to
create the set of “perceptual units” at the basis of numerosity
perception (fornaciai, cicchini, & burr, 2016; franconeri,
bemis, & alvarez, 2009; he, zhang, zhou, & chen, 2009; he,
zhou, zhou, he, & chen, 2015). for the purpose of our
investigation, this illusion allowed us to test whether a neural
signal i likely reflecting
the initial sensory representation of the stimulus, or the
perceived numerosity likely reflecting the final conceptual
representation of the stimulus. the results from that study
(fornaciai & park, 2018a), utilizing eeg and functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fmri), confirmed that an initial
sensory representation is formed early on in visual
processing (100msec) and in visual areas v2 and v3.

magnetic resonance imaging (fmri), confirmed that an’
sensory representation is formed early on in visual
processing (100msec) and in visual areas v2 and v3.
however, activity reflecting connected items, and thus likely
reflecting the conceptual representation, arises only later in
the visual stream (150msec), specifically in area v3 (fornaciai
& park, 2018a). as the timing of the two processing stages is
consistent with the timing of feedforward and feedback
visual activity (boehler, schoenfeld, heinze, & hopf, 2008;
fahrenfort, scholte, & lamme, 2007), we had interpreted the
later activity as reflecting the contribution of re-entrant
processing enabled by feedback signals from higher-order
areas. this would play a role in segmenting the items into
perceptual units.

however, results from this previous study could not
conclusively pinpoint feedback signals as the underlying
source of the later activity. an alternative explanation is that
the delayed brain activity related to connectedness reflects
slower high-spatial frequency signals reaching the visual
cortex in a feedforward manner (jones & keck, 1978;
meunsel & gibsan 19 mazen vinie. mereematt schiller.
slower high-spatial frequency signals reaching the visual
cortex in a feedforward manner (jones & keck, 1978;
maunsell & gibson, 1992; mazer, vinje, mcdermott, schiller,
& gallant, 2002). according to this view, an initial sensory
representation would be quickly created as soon as fast low-
spatial frequency (magnocellular) information reaches the
cortex. ata later time, such a representation would be refined
by means of high spatial frequency information, conveying
information about the thin lines connecting the items and
allowing a segmentation into perceptual units.

 

 

here, we attempt to disentangle these two hypotheses by
exploiting the connectedness illusion, in combination with a
perceptual bias created by the recent history of stimulation
(serial dependence; fischer & whitney, 2014), and visual
masking. serial dependence refers to a perceptual bias,
whereby a visual stimulus appears to be more similar to its
previous stimulus. as several studies have shown that the
perceived numerosity of a stimulus can be strongly biased by
the recent history of stimulation (cicchini, anobile, & burr,
2014; fornaciai & park, 2018b, 2018c, 2019a, 2019b, 2020a),
perceived numerosity of a stimulus can be strongly biased by
the recent history of stimulation (cicchini, anobile, & burr,
2014; fornaciai & park, 2018b, 2018c, 2019a, 2019b, 2020a),
the manipulation of serial dependence provides an ideal way
to investigate the functional mechanisms of numerosity
perception. masking, or more specifically backward masking
(enns & di lollo, 2000), refers to a procedure that makes a
target stimulus invisible by presenting another high-contrast
“mask” stimulus shortly after it. re-entrant processing in
early visual cortex has been shown to be suppressed (along
with the awareness of the masked stimulus), while early
feedforward processing is spared (lamme & roelfsema,
2000).

in the present study, we first assessed the connectedness
illusion, asking participants to discriminate the numerosity of
a variable probe dot array compared to a constant reference,
which could include either 18 isolated dots, or 18 pairwise-
connected dots. according to previous studies (fornaciai etal.
2016; franconeri etal., 2009; he etal., 2009), connecting pairs
of dots in an array is expected to yield a strong

connected dots. according to previous studies (fornaciai étal.,
2016; franconeri etal., 2009; he etal., 2009), connecting pairs
of dots in an array is expected to yield a strong
underestimation of numerosity. in the second experiment,
we assessed the serial dependence effect provided by an
irrelevant stimulus (“inducer”), which could contain either
isolated or pairwise-connected dots. namely, participants
were asked to discriminate the numerosity of a reference and
a probe array, which were preceded by a task-irrelevant
inducer stimulus inducing serial dependence. previous
studies, using a very similar procedure, showed that such an
inducer could significantly affect the perceived numerosity of
the subsequent reference stimulus (fornaciai & park, 2018¢,
2019). more specifically, a reference preceded by a less
numerous inducer is systematically underestimated, while a
reference preceded by a more numerous inducer is
overestimated.

 

given these manipulations, the first question we ask is
whether serial dependence operates on the veridical or the
perceived (i.e., perceptually reduced by connectedness)
awnsrosity ofthe inducer. then.we used visual kackward
whether serial dependence operates on the veridical or the
perceived (i.e., perceptually reduced by connectedness)
numerosity of the inducer. then, we used visual backward
masking to suppress re-entrant processing of the inducer and
to make it invisible. under backward masking conditions, we
have previously shown that the perceptual bias effect is
reversed, resulting in a repulsive bias akin to perceptual
adaptation as opposed to attractive serial dependence
(fornaciai & park, 2019a). if the segmentation into perceptual
units requires feedback signals, then masking should abolish
connectedness, and the stimulus should provide an effect on
subsequent task-relevant stimuli based on the vei
numerosity. alternatively, if feedforward process
sufficient for connectedness segmentation, then even a
masked connected-dot stimulus should provide an effect
based on the perceived reduced numerosity. our results
support the latter hypothesis, showing that even when
masking is applied, the effect provided by the inducer
stimulus reflects the set of connected items rather than the
veridical number of dots. this in turn suggests that feedback

stimulus reflects the set of connected items rather than the
veridical number of dots. this in turn suggests that feedback
signals and re-entrant processing are not strictly necessary
for the perception of connectedness and for creating a refined
(i.e., segmented) numerosity representation.

numerosity is a fundamental aspect of the external
environment, needed to guide our behavior in an effective
manner. previous studies show that numerosity processing
involves at least two temporal stages (~100 and ~150msec
after stimulus onset) in early visual cortex. one possibility is
that the two stages reflect an initial feedforward processing
followed by feedback signals from higher-order cortical areas
that underlie segmentation of visual inputs into perceptual
units that define numerosity. alternatively, multiple stages of
feedforward processing might progressively refine the input
leading to the segmented representation. here, we
distinguish these two hypotheses by exploiting the
connectedness illusion (i.e., the systematic underestimation
of pairwise-connected dots), backward masking (to suppress
feedback signals), and serial dependence (i., a perceptual
ias making a stimulus appear to be more similar to its

feedback signals), and serial dependence (i., a perceptual
ias making a stimulus appear to be more similar to its
preceding one). our results show that a connected dot array
biases the numerosity representation of the subsequent dot
array based on its illusory perception, irrespective of whether
it is visible or suppressed by masking. these findings
demonstrate that feedback processing is not strictly
necessary for the perceptual segmentation that gives rise to
perceived numerosity, and instead suggest that different
stages of feedforward activity presumably carrying low and
high spatial frequency information are sufficient to create a
numerosity representation in early visual areas.
