citation excerpt :
...furthermore, as(lii) accumulation in maize roots was higher than
that in wheat roots. this could be explained by the plant species
with different characteristics of as accumulation (cao et al., 2021).
after as is adsorbed by plant roots, the unreduced as(v) and
uncomplexed as(lll) are usually transported to the shoots through
vascular bundles, especially phloem (lyubenova et al., 2013; rosas-
castor et al., 2014; van der ent et al., 2019)...

4. conclusions

our work revealed that go significantly enhanced the
phytotoxicity of as (iii) and as(v), although the extent of
effect was dependent on both as and plant species. one
mechanism by which go enhanced as phytotoxicity was that
go up-regulated the expression of aquaporins and phosphate
transporter related genes, subsequently increasing the
accumulation of as (iii) and as (v) in the plant. in addition,
co-exposure with go induced more severe oxidative stress
than the single as exposure, which could have subsequently
damaged root plasma membrane and compromised
important detoxification pathways (e.g., arsenic
complexation with glutathione and arsenic efflux) in the
plants. our findings provide important new insights into the
mechanisms of synergistic phytotoxicity of nanomaterials
with as (iii) and as (v). however, it is clear that root
exudates, rhizosphere microbiome, and soil chemistry will
likely alter the environmental behavior and the combined
with as (iii) and as (v). however, it is clear that root
exudates, rhizosphere microbiome, and soil chemistry will
likely alter the environmental behavior and the combined
phytotoxicity of nanomaterials and as, which should be
carried out in the future investigation to fully understand the
possible environmental risk of go and related nanomaterials
applied in a more complex agricultural systems. our findings
suggested that we should consider its environmental risk
before applied go in arsenic-contaminated agriculture soil.

uptake

the macroelement (p, s, ca, mg, k) and microelement (fe,
mn, cu, zn, b) content in the roots and shoots of wheat and
tomato were measured across all treatments. go alone
exposure did not influence on the root and shoot nutrient
content (table 1, table 2). after 10 d exposure to as (iii),
go+as (iii), as (v), and go+as (v), the root p content of
wheat decreased from 5.66 + 0.36 mg/kg to 4.07 + 0.33, 3.09 +
0.40, 3.18 + 0.24, and 2.57 + 0.16 mg/kg, respectively (table 1).
‘larly, as (iii), go+as (iii), as (v), and go+as (v) input
wheat decreased from 5.66 + 0.36 mg/kg to 4.07 + 0.33, 3.09 +
0.40, 3.18 + 0.24, and 2.57 + 0.16 mg/kg, respectively (table 1).
‘larly, as (iii), go+as (iii), as (v), and go+as (v) input
resulted in 42.8%, 64.5%, 38.3%, and 52.9% decrease in the
shoot p of wheat, respectively (table 1). the decreasing trend
of the p content is consistent with the levels of as
accumulation in plants. similar results were evident in
tomato (table 2). these findings are likely the result of
competitive uptake between as and p in plants, perhaps
induced the p depletion (li et al., 2016). in the as (iii), go+as
(ii1), as (v), and go+as (v) treatments, the content of
macroelement (ca, mg, and k) and microelement (fe, mn,
and cu) in the plant roots and shoots was obviously below
the control. in the presence of go, the overall trends in
nutrient content were lower than that of the as alone,
although some elements did vary across the treatments.
decreases in the nutrient content were largely a function of
phytotoxicity (electrolyte leakage) induced by as and the
combination of go and as (tu and ma, 2005). the presence of
as (iii, v) elevated the $ and zn content in both plant species,
while the b content was unaffected (table 1, table 2). sis a
combination of go and as (tu and ma, 2005). the presence of
as (iii, v) elevated the $ and zn content in both plant species,
while the b content was unaffected (table 1, table 2). $ is a
macronutrient and plays important roles in protein
iosynthesis related to the as detoxification pathway. zn
maintains the activities of various enzymes. therefore,
increases in the $ and zn content in both plants may be an
abiotic stress related physiological response (dixit et al., 2015,
hu et al., 2018). the addition of go inhibited the s and zn
uptake by plants, which will reduced the biosynthesis of as
detoxification related proteins, and consequently resulted in
higher phytotoxicity of as to both plants (ahmad et al., 2020,
srivastava et al., 2016).

it is demonstrated that the particles with the size larger than
200 nm were minimally accumulated by plants (lv et al.,
2019, wojcieszek et al., 2019). it is noted that size of go used
in this study ranged from 1 to 5 ym and the hydrodynamic
jiameter of go in 25% hoagland medium was 2071 + 101 nm
(table $4). therefore, it is unlikely that go could enter into
plant roots. however, the “reverse trojan horse effect”
induced by go did not decrease the phytotoxicity of as (iii, v)
as only 3.7% as (iii) and 2.0% as (v) were adsorbed on the go
surface and transformation of both as (ii) and as (v) was not
detected (table $5).

 

surface and transformation of both as (lil) and as (v) was not

3.6. effect of go on the arsenic detoxification in
plants

gsh plays diverse role in plant response to the as-triggered
phytotoxicity, such as the thiol-groups in gsh can bind with
as and act as an antioxidant to scavenge the exceed ros,
which will subsequently alleviate as phytotoxicity (cao et al.,
2019). in the current study, go had no effect on the
concentration of gsh in wheat and tomato roots (fig. $9). in
the as (iii), go+as (iii), as (v), and go+as (v) treatments, the
gsh concentration in the wheat roots increased to 2.2, 1.8,
18, and 1.4-fold of the control (fig. s9). similar results were
also found in the as- and go-treated tomato roots (fig. $9).
exposure to as species is known to enhance the level of gsh
due to the stress physiological responses (dixit et al., 2015).
the addition of go decreased the gsh level in the as (iii, v)
treated roots, demonstrating that go exerted a negative
impact on the gsh synthesis and subsequently inhibited as
(11) immobilization in roots (zhao et al,, 2009).

 

treated roots, demonstrating that go exerted a negative
impact on the gsh synthesis and subsequently inhibited as

efflux the as in plants to external space is another
detoxification pathway (li et al., 2016). the excretion of as
from wheat and tomato roots as a function of time was
explored after 24-h exposure to as (iii, v) in the presence or
absence of go. as efflux from wheat and tomato roots
reached an apparent equilibrium at 3 and 5 h, respectively
(fig. 7a and b). after 12 h, 27.3 pg (34.2%) and 14.4 pg (21.6%)
as was released into the medium from as (iii) and as (v)
treated wheat, respectively (fig. 7a and s10). importantly, go
significantly inhibited the as efflux from wheat roots, the
efflux values (as efflux percentages) were 18.7 ug (23.0%) and
9.2 ug (11.2%) in the go+as (iii) and go+as (v) treatments,
respectively (fig. 7a and s10). similarly, co-exposure with go
also inhibited as release from tomato roots (fig. 7b). it is
possible that go down-regulated the genes associated with
as efflux transport, such as the atp-binding cassette
transporter, and then decreased as release from the plant

 

 

 

possible that go down-regulated the genes associated with
as efflux transport, such as the atp-binding cassette
transporter, and then decreased as release from the plant
(wu et al., 2019, tang and zhao, 2020). another explanation
could be that go up-regulated the genes associated with as
influx transporters, such as aquaporins and phosphate
transporters, effectively increasing as uptake and altering
efflux equilibrium (zhao et al., 2009). the efflux of as from
treated wheat and tomato in the go amended as-free
medium was lower than that in the as-free medium (fig. 7a
and b), indicating that decline of as efflux in the go+as
treatments might contribute greatly to altering the
physiological processes of plant, rather than the co-exposure
of go and as induced higher phytotoxicity than that of the as
alone.

oxidative stress is a primary factor that leads to damage of
the plasma membrane (li et al., 2020). ro-induced by as (iii,
v) and go in wheat and tomato roots was evaluated using a
tic indicator (islam et al., 2007). in wheat, as (il) and as (v)
exposure increased the ro level by 2.0- and 1.7-fold over
controls, respectively; under co-exposure treatment with go,
the value further increased by 2.7- and 2.5-fold as compared
to the controls, respectively (fig. $7). increased ro indicates
that the redox balance in plants has been compromised

the value further increased by 2.7- and 2.5-fold as compared
to the controls, respectively (fig. $7). increased ro indicates
that the redox balance in plants has been compromised
(islam et al., 2007). in addition, the level of ros accumulation
in both wheat and tomato roots suggests that go had no
impact on redox balance (fig. ga and b); both as species
clearly induced the excess levels of ros (fig. ga and b).
however, co-exposure of go significantly induced more ros
generation in as species treated roots as compared to the
corresponding single analyte exposure (fig. ga and b); this
was due to the greater as accumulation as a function of go
amendment. the excess ros accumulation in as (iii), go+as
(ill), and go+as (v) treatments also resulted in several-fold
high level of lipid peroxidation in roots as indicated by
malondialdehyde (mda) content (fig. ssa and b), which then
resulted in compromised plasma membrane integrity.

tapht2, sipt1, and sipt2 in the go treatment was up-
regulated after a 2-day exposure (fig. 4c). however, as (iii)
decreased the expression of tapht!, tapht2, sipt1, and sipt2
to 82.3%, 72.7%, 69.0%, and 61.7% of the control levels (fig.
4c). in the go+as (iii) treatment, the expression of taphti,
tapht2, sipt1, and sipt2 was 2.3, 1.3, 2.7, and 1.6-fold greater
than in the as (iii) treatment (fig. 4c). similarly, as (v)
exposure also down-regulated the expression of tapht!,
tapht2, sipt1, and sipt2 to 23.0%, 26.0%, 60.7%, and 34.3% of
controls (fig. 4c). in the go+as (v) treatment, the expression
of tapht1, tapht2, sipti, and sipt2 was up-regulated by 3.9,
2.1, 48, and 1.9-fold that in the as (v) treatment (fig. 4c). the
up-regulation of these phosphate transporter related genes
could be ascribed to go presence resulting in phosphate
depletion due to adsorption, which could stimulate plants to
up-regulate transporters to acquire greater levels of
phosphate from the growth media (zhao et al., 2017, yu et al.,
2020).

evan blue staining was used to investigate the plasma
membrane integrity in exposed roots; the extent of blue
coloring directly correlates with membrane damage (zhang
et al., 2016). some slight blue color was evident in both wheat
and tomato roots in the control and the go treatments (fig.
5a and b), suggesting that the root plasma membranes were
largely intact. in go+as treatments, the blue coloring in roots
bly darker than those in the single as treatments,
indicating the addition of go further compromised the root
plasma membranes in as treated plants. damaged plasma
membrane can lead to increases the influx of as into plants
(deng et al., 2017); however, given that go itself had no
impact on the plasma membrane integrity in roots, it is
possible that this may not be the primary mechanism by
which go increased as uptake by plants. it was evident that
go obviously promoted the growth of lateral roots in tomato
(fig. 5b), subsequently increased the possible

which go increased as uptake by plants. it was evident that
go obviously promoted the growth of lateral roots in tomato
(fig. 5b), which subsequently increased the possible
interactions between as and the root systems (zhou and hu,
2017). the promotion of lateral root growth was mostly
because the presence of go decreased the aba content in
tomato roots, and subsequently inhibited the lateral root
quiescence (duan et al., 2013).

aba is an important abiotic stress-related phytohormone that
can down-regulate the level of aquaporin-related genes (yue
et al., 2017). the aba concentration in wheat and tomato
roots treated with go for 2 days was significantly reduced by
22.6% and 35.4%, respectively, as compared to the control (fig.
s6). therefore, the up-regulated aquaporin-related genes in
the roots by go could be attributed to the decreased aba
content. shen et al. (2019) also demonstrated that the aba
level in rice was decreased after 5-day (5-50 mg/l) exposure
to go. furthermore, the addition of go increased water
uptake by both wheat and tomato over a 10-day exposure
(fig. 4a), suggesting that the up-regulated expression of
aquaporin genes altered a range of physiological processes,
including increased as (iii) uptake. in the go+as (iii) and
go+as (v) treatments, the water uptake of plants displayed
aquaporin genes altered a range of physiological processes,
including increased as (iii) uptake. in the go+as (iii) and
go+as (v) treatments, the water uptake of plants displayed
similar trends to the as (iii) and as (v) alone treatments (fig.
4a and b), although the biomass of both wheat and tomato in
the go+as treatments was significantly less than that in the
as alone treatments.

arsenic that is accumulated by plants can be detoxified by
plants via as (v) reduction and as methylation (zhao et al.,
2008, li et al., 2016, garbinski et al., 2019). in both wheat and
tomato, only the inorganic as species were observed; there
were no organic as species detected (fig. 2a and b), which
may be due to the low arsenic methylation ability of plant
species (li et al., 2016, zhao et al., 2009). in the as (iii) and as
(v) alone treatments, the as (iii) as (v) ratio in wheat was
1.82 and 2.22, respectively (fig. 2c). in the co-presence of go,
the as (iii)/as (v) ratio in both wheat and tomato was not
altered, relative to the as (iii) single exposure (fig. 2c).
however, the as (iii)/as (v) ratio in wheat co-treated with go
and as (v) was 5.19, which is more than 2-fold that of the as
(v) alone treatment. in the as (v) treated tomato, go
increased the as (iii) as (v) ratio to 7.25, which increased by
32.3% compared to the as (v) alone treatment (fig. 2c). one

3ei¢ conipared to teas (vyaone treatment (rie. zu) one
of the primary pathways for as detoxification in plants is the
reduction of as (v) to as (iii), which can then be subsequently
bound to phytochelations (li et al., 2016). therefore, the
higher as (iii)/as (v) ratio in the plant exposed to go+as (v)
than that of exposing to as (v) was likely a response of plants
to the higher as (v) influx. the tas shoot/tas root ratio in as
(v) treated plants was decreased by the presence of go (fig.
2c). the higher as (iii) as (v) ratio resulted in more extensive
decreases in the tas shoot/ta root ratio in plants co-treated
with go and as (v) than that in as (v) alone treated plants;
this is due to the fact that as (iii) is the species that
complexes with phytochelatins (li et al., 2016). it is worth
noting that the growth inhibition in the go+as (v) treatment
was still greater than that in the as (v) alone treatments,
although the as (iii)/as (v) ratio was increased and tas
shoot/t,; root ratio was decreased. more as accumulation in
go+as (v) co-treated plants yielded concentrations of as (iii)
and as (v) in the plants that were higher than those in as (v)
alone treatments (fig. 2).

 

 

alone treatments (fig. 2).

3.4. mechanisms of the go enhanced as (iii) and
as (v) uptake

aquaporins are the main transporters for as (iii) influx into
plants (li et al., 2016) whereas as (v) enters plant roots via
phosphate transporters (jia et al., 2014). the expression of
genes associated with aquaporins was evaluated in both
wheat and tomato root tissues (fig. 3a and b) in the go, as
(iii), go+as (iii), as (v) and go+as (v) treatments. after 2-day
of go exposure, the expression of tapip1;1, tapip1;2, tapip1;6,
tatip1;2, tatip2;4, and tanip4;2 in wheat were increased by
2.6, 1.4, 1.4, 2.6, 0.3, and 3.7-fold, respectively. as (iii)
exposure significantly downregulated the expression of
tapip1;1, tapip1;2, tapip1;6, tatip1;2, tatip2;4, and tanip4;2
to 26.3%, 31.0%, 14.7%, 34.9%, 33.7%, and 17.7% of controls,
respectively. this level of decrease is likely due the
phytotoxicity of as (iii), with subsequent reductions in overall
growth and less influx of as (iii) into the roots (verma et al.,
2020). in the go+as (iii) treatment, the expre:
phytotoxicity of as (iii), with subsequent reductions in overall
growth and less influx of as (iii) into the roots (verma et al.,
2020). in the go+as (iii) treatment, the expression of
tapip1;1, tapip1;2, tapip1;6, tatip1;2, and tanip4;2 was 5.3,
18, 3.8, 1.8, and 7.9-fold greater than the corresponding as
(iil) treatment values. exposure to as (v) decreased the level
of tapip1; 1, tapip1;2, tapip1;6, tatip1;2, tatip2;4, and
tanip4;2 to 37.7%, 42.0%, 50.7%, 59.7%, 44.7%, and 56.3% of the
corresponding controls. this decrease is most likely the result
of reductions of as (v) to as (iii) by root exudates in the
nutrient medium (wang et al., 2018). in the go+as (v)
treatment, the expression of tapip1;1, tapip1;2, tapip1;6,
tatip1;2, tatip2;4, and tanip4;2 was 4.6, 2.4, 2.2, 1.6, 1.5, and
2.8-fold greater than that in the as (v) treatment. for tomato
exposed to go for 2 days, the expression of sipip1;1, sipip1;2,
sipip2;1, sitip1;2, sitip3; 1, sitip4;1, and sinip1;2 was increased
by 4.0, 2.8, 2.6, 4.5, 1.5, 1.4, and 5.6-fold, respectively. in the
go+as (iii, v) treatment, the expression of aquaporin-related
genes was also greater than that in as (iii, v) alone
treatments. therefore, the addition of go up-regulated
aquaporin-related genes, which explains the enhanced as
genes was also greater than that in as (iii, v) alone
treatments. therefore, the addition of go up-regulated
aquaporin-related genes, which explains the enhanced as
(ill) uptake and accumulation by plants. zhou and hu (2017)
reported that the expression of aquaporin-related genes (e.g.,
pip1;3 and pip2;2) were downregulated in rice treated with
go and subsequently reduced the go uptake. a possible
explanation for this opposite result could be the
hydrodynamic diameter (in the growth medium) of go used
in this study was 2071 + 101 nm, which made them difficult
to enter the roots, or to differences in the plant species and
growth conditions used.

fig. ss indicates that the method used in this study to analyze
ifferent arsenic species concentrations was valid and
applicable, where the r? of standard curves and the sample
recovery rates for three-time analysis were all higher than
0.9997% and 96.81%, respectively. for both wheat and tomato,
the tas in the as (iii) treated roots and shoots was higher than
those treated with as (v) (fig. 2a and b). however, itis likely
that phosphate exist in the plant growth medium inhibited
the uptake of as (v) by plants by competition with same
transporter (abedin et al., 2002). exposure to go increased
the tas in the as (iii)-treated wheat roots and shoots by 55.6%
and 43.8%, respectively, relative to the respective as (iii) alone
treatment (fig. 2a). similarly, approximately 85.5% and 68.3%
increases were evident in the as (v)-treated wheat roots and
shoots, respectively (fig. 2a). for tomato, the addition of go
obviously enhanced the as accumulation in the as (iii) and as
(v) treated tomato roots by 108.1% and 91.2%, respectively, as
compared to as (iii, v) alone exposure; similarly, go-
mediated increases in as accumulation in the as (iii) and as
(v) treated shoots were 80.2% and 68.3%, respectively (fig.

 

 

 

 

 

compared to as (ill, v) alone exposure; similarly, go-
mediated increases in as accumulation in the as (iii) and as
(v) treated shoots were 80.2% and 68.3%, respectively (fig.
2b). as-induced phytotoxicity is positively correlated with its
in planta concentrations (jia et al., 2014, garbinski et al.,
2019). go resulted in greater as accumulation in the as (v)
treated wheat when comparing with as (iii) treatment.
conversely, for tomato more as accumulated in the as (iii)
treatment that with as (v). when comparing across species,
go caused greater as accumulation in tomato than in wheat.
therefore, go presence increased in planta as accumulation
depended both on as type and plant species, and had similar
trends to the findings for as phytotoxicity.

go thickness was 1.5 nm and the lateral size was between 1
and 5 ums indicated by afm image (fig. $1). the intensity
ratio of the d band (1346 cm”) to g band (1596 cm~') (ip/ic)
was 0.91 + 0.04 as determined by a raman spectrum (fig.
s2a). the xrd spectrum of go exhibits a peak at 10.1° (fig.

sib), and the interlayer spacing of go was calculated to be —
0.86 nm, indicating abundant oxygen functional groups
inserted into the interlayer (zhao et al., 2017). xps results
demonstrate that the o atomic percentage in go was 53.1%
(fig. s2c, table $3). the c1s peak could be de-convolved into
c-c/cc (43.4%, 285.0 ev), c-oh (10.9%, 286.6 ev), c-o-c
(33.1%, 287.1 ev), co (7.1%, 288.3 ev), and 0-c°o (5.4%, 289.5
ev) (fig. s2c, table $3). go possess large surface area (296 +
21 m2/g) and abundance total pore volume (0.274 + 0.024
cm3/g) (table $4), which provided sufficient adsorption sites
for the co-occurring as (iii, v) (cao et al., 2019, reynosa~
martinez et al., 2020). the go hydrodynamic diameter in 25%
hoagland medium (2071 # 101 nm) was greater than that in
deionized water (1410 + 97 nm) (table $4). this is likely the
result of salts in the medium neutralizing or compressing the
electric double layer of the go (cao et al., 2019), causing the
zeta potential in 25% hoagland medium (-22.9 + 0.4 mv) to
be lower than in deionized water (-44.3 0.8 mv) (table $4).

3.2. phytotoxicity upon exposure to go and as
(iii, v)

after a 10-day exposure, the presence of go at 0.1-1 mg/l
had no effect on the fresh biomass of wheat and tomato (fig.
$3, $4). exposure to 0.5 mg/l as (iii), 1 mg/l as (ill), and 1
mg/l as (v) reduced wheat fresh biomass from 6.22 + 0.17 g
in the control to 5.99 + 0.14, 5.60 + 0.15, and 5.71 £0.17 g,
respectively (fig. $3), but had no impact on the fresh biomass
of tomato (fig. $4). monocotyledonous plant species (wheat)
are known to be more sensitive to as (iii, v) than
icotyledonous plants (tomato) due to the lower arsenic
detoxification ability (e.g., as binding capacity) of monocots
(pirgelova et al., 2011). go (1 mg/l) significantly enhanced the
toxicity of 0.5 mg/l as (iii), 1 mg/l as (iii), and 1 mg/l as (v)
to wheat (fig. $3), whose fresh biomass reduced to 5.74+
0.15, 5.22 + 0.18, and 5.33 + 0.12 g, respectively. these findings
align with hu et al. (2014), who reported that 0.1-1 mg/l go

amplified the toxicity of 10 mg/l as (v) to wheat. it is noted
that our findings highlighted this synergistic phytotoxicity
between go and as (v) at 10-fold lower concentrations (0.1-
1 mg/l); in addition, we demonstrated analogous joint
phytotoxicity between go and as (iii). the mechanisms by
which go enhances as (iii) phytotoxicity might be different
than with as (v), largely due to the differential pathways of
as (iii) uptake and metabolism (zhao et al., 2009). co-
exposure of go (0.5 and 1 mg/l) and 1 mgil as (iii) also
caused toxicity to tomato (fig. $4). in order to maximize
phenotype differences across all treatments and to better
understand the mechanisms of go-enhanced the toxicity of
as species to mono- and dicot plant species, we increased
both go and as (iii, v) dose in the following experiments.

 

  

and fold lower concet

       
 

one common trend was that the phytotoxicity of as (iii) was
greater than as (v) to both wheat and tomato (fig. 1), which
is align with liu et al. 2005, marmiroli et al., 2014. go at the
higher dose of 10 mg/l still did not influence the growth of
wheat and tomato after 10-day exposure (fig. 1). the co-
presence of go (10 mg/l) aggravated the growth inhibition of
higher dose of 10 mg]l still did not influence the growth of
wheat and tomato after 10-day exposure (fig. 1). the co-
presence of go (10 mg/l) aggravated the growth inhi
5, 10, and 20 mg]l as (iii) treated-wheat from 15.1, 58.3,
68.7-21.4%, 68.3%, and 74.9%, respectively, relative to
untreated controls; similarly, the growth inhibition of as (v)
treated-wheat at 5, 10, and 20 mg/l enhanced from 9.6, 39.5,
51.6-39.7%, 53.5%, and 64.0%, respectively, by the co-exposure
with 10 mg/l go (fig. 1a). for tomato, the addition of go also
enhanced the as (iii)-toxicity by approximately 13-24%,
when comparing with the as (iii) alone treatment. similarly,
an 8-18% increase in toxicity was evident in as (v)-treated
tomato upon go co-exposure (fig. 1b). phenotypic images
and biomass results showed that the co-presence of go
amplified the phytotoxicity of as (iii) to wheat, and to a lesser
extent, had the same enhancement of toxicity of as (v) (fig.
1a, cand d). however, for tomato, the level of as (iii)
phytotoxicity enhancement by go was greater than that of as
(v) (fig. 1b, e and f). regard to plant species, go
enhanced as phytotoxicity to a greater extent for tomato than
for wheat (fig. 1b and c). hence, the precise impact of go-

extracted solution was centrifuged at 8000 g (15 min, 4°c),
and the supernatant was evaporated at 4 °c, followed by

was determined by water loss from each container; the
weight of each container with 200 ml 25% strength of
hoagland’s solution was recorded before go, as, and go+as
exposure. the containers with the remaining solution were
weighed at 8:00 am every day over a 10-day exposure period.
accumulative water loss was used to represent water uptake

2. materials and methods
1. introduction

arsenic (as) is highly toxic and carcinogenic substance
commonly found in agriculture soils (muehe et al., 2019,
zhang et al., 2018). the agency for toxic substances and
disease registry (atsdr) lists as on the top of the 2019
priority list of hazardous substances

(https: wwwaatsdr.cdc.gov/spl/index.html#2019spl). the
arsenic average concentration in soils globally is
approximately 5mg/kg, although in european soils, this value
is higher at 7.5-20mg/kg (wang et al., 2020a). as in
agriculture soils can accumulate in plants, thereby entering
the food chain and posing risk to human health risk (tasneem
et al., 2020, kumarathilaka et al., 2019). according to the
world health organization (who) report, the acceptable
maximum contaminant level for inorganic as in plants is
0.2mg/kg (who, 2016). arsenite (as (iii)) and arsenate (as
world health organization (who) report, the acceptable
maximum contaminant level for inorganic as in plants is
0.2mg/kg (who, 2016). arsenite (as (iii)) and arsenate (as
(v)) are two dominating inorganic arsenic species in
agricultural soils (tasneem et al., 2020, muehe et al., 2019);
importantly, the toxicity, bioaccumulation, and metabolism
in plants is as species dependent. the phytotoxicity of as (1)
is higher than that of as (v) (wang et al., 2018). the primary
route of as (iii) uptake in plants was the aquaporins, which is
a kind of membrane channels (garbinski et al., 2019, liet al.,
2016). due to similarities in molecular structure, as (v) is
effectively mobilized by phosphate transporters (zhao et al.,
2009, li et al., 2016). a primary strategy for as detoxification
in plants is the reduction of as (v) to as (iii) by as (v)
reductase, with subsequent vacuolar sequestration after
inding with phytochelatins (zhao et al., 2009, garbinski et
al., 2019). in addition, plants can efflux unbound as (iii) into
the extracellular environment (garbinski et al., 2019, li et al.,
2016) and maintain an in vivo “equilibrium” state of as
accumulation and speciation (li et al., 2016). under more
complex multi-contaminant exposures, potential interactions

accumulation and speciation (li et al., 2016). under more
complex multi-contaminant exposures, potential interactions
with as, the as “equilibrium” state and associated
downstream metabolism could be significantly disturbed
within biota (luo et al., 2020, qian et al., 2020, cao et al.,
2019). however, little work has been done on such complex
exposure scenarios. as such, investigation of the impacts of
co-exposure of different contaminants on agricultural crops
is needed to fully understand the true environmental health
risk of as.

 

 

 

 

 

with the rapidly expanding interest in nanotechnology in
agriculture, nanomaterial use in agricultural soils has
increased significantly (wang et al., 2020b, ma et al., 2020,
wang et al., 2019a, lowry et al., 2019). one such nanomaterial
of interest is graphene oxide (go), a distinct 2d carbon-based
nanomaterial composed of a number of functional oxygen
groups and graphene layer (tang et al., 2020). go has been
used as a synergist of pesticides (wang et al., 2019b, tong et

al,, 2018) and fertilizers (an et al., 2017), a biomarker (giust et

3] 9012) and a6 9.6) nar (thon.

 

 

used as a synergist of pesticides (wang et al., 2019b, tong et
al. 2018) and fertilizers (an et al., 2017), a biomarker (giust et
al., 2018), and as a soil moisture retention conditioner (zhao
et al., 2020, he et al., 2018) in agriculture. the global market
for go-associated products is expected to reach a value of
$520 million by 2027 (lin et al., 2019, mohite and prasad,
2020), which will inevitably result in go accumulation in
agricultural soils. due to its abundant functional oxygen
groups, great pore volume, and large surface area, it is likely
that go will interact with as (iii) and as (v) (reynosa-
martinez et al., 2020, cao et al., 2019). it is reported that go
could alter the in planta accumulation and toxicity of
coexisting contaminants (gao et al., 2019, zhao et al., 2019,
hu et al., 2018, li et al., 2020). for example, co-presence of
10mg/l go enhanced 38.4% and 19.8% cd?* accumulation in
rice and wheat shoot as compared with 1mg/l cd2* alone
treatment, and then increased the toxicity of cd?* in plants
(gao et al., 2019, li et al., 2020). conversely, cu*-induced

(hu et al., 2018, zhao et al., 2019). given these
contradictory findings, it is difficult to predict the effects of
go on as accumulation and toxicity in crop plants. it is
reported that go increased the as (v) toxicity to wheat (hu et
al., 2014), although others have demonstrated that the
toxicity, bioaccumulation, and metabolism of as in plants
depended on both as- and plant species (li et al., 2016). for
example, a dicot crop (soybean) exhibited greater as-
triggered defense response than that in a monocot species
(maize) (pirselova et al., 2011). therefore, the effects of go on
the accumulation and toxicity of as species such as as (iii)
and as (v) in different plant species (e.g., monocot, dicot)
need further investigation.

 

 

the mechanisms by which go alters the accumulation of co-
contaminants in plants have been attributed to several
potential mechanisms, including: (1) go enhanced/decreased
accumulation of co-contaminants in plants through the
contaminants in plants have been attributed to several
potential mechanisms, including: (1) go enhanced/decreased
accumulation of co-contaminants in plants through the
“trojan horse effect” |“reverse trojan horse effect” (zhao et
al., 2019, de medeiros et al., 2020); (2) go induced root cell
membrane damage and subsequently promotion of co-
contaminant uptake (hu et al., 2014, li et al., 2020); or (3)
go-induced alteration of co-contaminant form (deng et al.,
2017). dai et al. (2018) reported that in caenorhabditis
elegans, go down-regulated the expression of as (iii) binding
protein, thereby increasing the excretion of as (iii). however,
little is known about the effects of go on the physiological
and molecular responses of plant upon as exposure.
interestingly, villagarcia et al. (2012) demonstrated that
oxidized carbon nanotubes activated the expression of the
water channel protein (e.g. as (iii) transporter) in tomato.
this finding is relevant given that the physicochemical
properties of go are si
(verma et al., 2019). therefore, we hypothesized that go may
up-regulate the expression of aquaporin related genes,
thereby promoting the uptake as (iii) by plants.

in this study, model monocot (triticum aestivum l.) and dicot

assess the effects of go on the metabolism of as (iii, v) in

graphene oxide (go) has exhibited significant potential to
improve crop cultivation and yield. the application of go in
agriculture will inevitably result
conventional contaminants, causing potential changes to
environmental behavior and toxicity of conventional
contaminants. this study explored the joint phytotoxicity of
go and arsenic species (arsenite [as (iii)], arsenate [as (v)])

to monocot (triticum aestivum l.) and dicot (solamun
lycopersicum) plant species. under the environmentally
relevant concentrations, go (1 mg/l) significantly increased

being both as- and plant species-specific. one mechanism of
enhanced arsenic phytotoxicity could be go-induced up-
regulation of the aquaporin and phosphate transporter
related genes expression, which would lead to the increased
accumulation of as (iii) and as (v) in plants. in addition, co-
exposure with go resulted in more severe oxidative stress
than single as exposure, which could subsequently induce
damage in root plasma membranes and compromise key
arsenic detoxification pathways such as complexation with
glutathione and efflux. co-exposure to go and as also led to
more significant reduction in macro- and micronutrient
content. the provided data highlight the high-impact of
nanomaterials on the environmental risk of as in agricultural
systems.
