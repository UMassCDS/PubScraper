additionally, further research is needed to determine the
mechanisms that give rise to greater co-occurrence of positive
and negative affects among older adults. studies should also
investigate individual difference factors that may be

associated with emotion co-occurrence, including life

 

associated with emotion co-occurrence, including life
experiences (e.g., charles 2005), personality traits (e.g., mill
et al. 2018; ong and bergeman 2004), and propensity for

  

affect asynchrony (i.e., independent fluctuation of pa and na;
rafaeli et al. 2007).
future directions

this study identified age group differences in short-term
spontaneous emotion responses to film clips about
interpersonal loss. an important next step in this line of
research is to determine the short- and long-term impact of
affect co-occurrence in reaction to negative experiences.
perhaps the ability to engage with a negative experience with
mixed affect is associated with a greater likelihood of finding

 

mixed affect is associated with a greater likelihood of finding
meaning in that experience (tugade and fredrickson 2004),
allowing for a more complex understanding of or appreciation
for these events later on. it is also possible that more mixed
emotional reactions in the setting of a negative experience are
associated with differences in the way that experience is
remembered later on. the presence of pa in the setting ofa
negative experience may allow for easier positive reappraisal

of the situation.
limitations

the study samples were demographically homogeneous. the
lack of racial, ethnic, and socioeconomic diversity, especially
among the older adult sample, limits the generalizability of

among the older adult sample, limits the generalizability of
findings. both age groups included substantially more female-
identified than male-identified participants, which limits
generalizability of results; however, gender differences are
typically not found in self-reported affective reactivity (e.g.,
kunzmann and griihn 2005; labouvie-vief et al. 2003;
mikkelsen et al. 2018). the film clips used in the negative
mood induction may have been differentially relevant to older
and younger adults due to their focus on interpersonal loss. we
did not collect a measure of arousal at each time point. instead,
we collected an overall rating of arousal of the film clips after
the completion of the study procedures, which does not allow
for consideration of how arousal changed over the course of
the mood induction. older adults rated the film clips as more
arousing than younger adults. an alternative explanation as to

why older adults experience greater co-occurrence between
arousing tnan younger aauits. an alternative explanation as to

why older adults experience greater co-occurrence between
paand nain response to the mood induction is that they
experienced the mood induction as more ambiguous than
younger persons. we did not have the data to address these
alternative explanations as to why we age group differences in
affect co-occurrence arose in the recovery period.
a tendency to experience both positive and negative emotions
at once—or to report some degree of positive emotion in the
face of negative stimuli or experiences—is a skill that is
encouraged in certain psychotherapeutic approaches.
acceptance-based approaches instruct persons to act in ways
that reflect one’s greater values, instead of reacting directly to
negative emotions in the moment (e.g., hayes 2004). if older
adults tend to experience concurrent positive and negative
emotions more readily than younger persons, they may be
inherently more able to sustain positive emotions in the
presence of negative emotions or resist acting in direct
response to negative emotions. this framework may help

explain why co-occurrence of negative and positive emotions

explain why co-occurrence of negative and positive emotions
is associated with better emotional well-being (hay and diehl
2011) and physical health in older adults (hershfield et al.
2013). perhaps mixed emotional experiences serve as a
protective resource for older adults, allowing them to more
easily find meaning in negative situations (tugade and
fredrickson 2004), to cope more effectively after engaging
with negative stimuli (ong et al. 2006), and/or to regulate
negative emotions more effectively (e.g., finan et al. 2011;
reich et al. 2003).
it is possible that greater co-occurrence between pa and na in
response to the mood induction is a by-product of greater
mean in pa in older than younger adults. that is, as noted
above, older adults reported higher positive affects than
younger adults at each time point in this study. greater
baseline pa may serve as a resource for older adults that is
maintained in the face of negative emotions and experiences,
an idea that is consistent with the theoretical predictions of
savi (charles and luong 2013). according to savi, older
adults have difficulty engaging cognitive—behavioral emotion
regulation techniques when faced with highly negative
situations. higher pa might serve as a resource for emotion
regulation for older adults that does not involve high cognitive
load and is thus available to older adults regardless of the

intensitv of the situation
load and is thus available to older adults regardless of the

intensity of the situation.
co-occurrence of positive and negative affect
as expected, and consistent with prior findings of affect co-
occurrence in daily life (carstensen et al. 2000; carstensen et
al. 2011; schneider and stone 2015), older adults evidenced
greater co-occurrence of positive and negative emotions than
younger adults in response to the mood manipulation. our
results are consistent with savi’s predictions of more complex
associative networks with age (charles 2010; magai et al.
2006) and sst’s prediction of greater emphasis on emotional

experiences across valence in old age (carstensen et al. 2003).
older adults reported higher positive affects than younger
adults at several time points. contrary to predictions, there
were no significant age group differences for changes in
positive affects following the mood induction. positive affects
decreased in response to the negative mood induction and
increased during recovery for older and younger adults. thus,
whereas older adults tended to report more positive affect
than younger persons—consistent with past research (e.g.,
carstensen et al. 2011)—there were not differential changes in
positive affects by age group. higher positive affect in older
adults may facilitate emotion well-being by providing a
resource for regulation when faced with negative situations or
stimuli. additionally, greater positive affect in older than

jesourcejolreguiallon when laceq with-negative.situations.o©

stimuli. additionally, greater positive affect in older than
younger adults may create more frequent opportunities for

mixed emotional experiences.
the finding of greater hostility in response to the film clips in
older than younger adults was unexpected given the content of
the film clips. however, several of the film clips involve
perpetration of negative actions by antagonists, which may
have contributed to feelings of hostility in participants.
perhaps older adults felt more empathy for the pain
experienced by protagonists in the films than younger adults,
consistent with findings in prior studies (beadle et al. 2015;
sze et al. 2012). greater empathy in older than younger adults
is in line with the predictions of sst because it may reflect

greater attunement to interpersonal, emotionally meaningful
male lac carctancan at al 2002)

greater attunement to interpersonal, emotionally meaningful
goals (e.g., carstensen et al. 2003).
age group differences in recovery for na and hostility did not
remain significant after controlling for baseline affect and
affect reactivity. further, there were no age group differences
in negative affects during the final recovery time point. thus,
the greater recovery exhibited by older than younger adults
appears to be a consequence of greater reactivity; a stronger
response to the mood induction set the stage for a stronger
recovery. this provides additional evidence that older adults
are effective and efficient at regulating robust emotion
responses to laboratory mood inductions (e.g., brady et al.
2018; larcom and isaacowitz 2009; livingstone and
isaacowitz 2018; lohani and isaacowitz 2014; phillips et al.

isaacowitz 2018; lohani and isaacowitz 2014; phillips et al.
2008), even when not instructed to use specific emotion
regulation techniques.

in contrast to prior studies (charles and carstensen 2008;
ready and santorelli 2016; rocke et al. 2009; stawski et al.
2008) and to our hypotheses, but consistent with other
studies (kunzmann and griihn 2005; streubel and kunzmann
2011), older adults reacted more strongly to a negative mood
induction than younger adults. specifically, older participants
exhibited greater increases in na and hostility after watching
film clips about interpersonal loss. in addition, and in line
with predictions, older adults exhibited greater recovery than
younger adults in na and hostility. whereas prior studies have
suggested that older adults recover more quickly than younger
adults from negative emotions over the span of hours or days
(carstensen et al. 2000; hay and diehl 2011; scott et al. 2013;

greater mixed emotions during reactivity to the mood

both age groups recovered efficiently from the mood
induction but did not fully return to baseline after 10-min. age
group differences in emotional responses were greater
immediately following the mood induction than after the

small but nonetheless provide several insights into age group
differences in spontaneous affective responses to a negative
mood induction.

further support of the prediction that older adults would
evidence more affect co-occurrence than younger persons,
older adults were more likely to endorse na and pa above the

mean during reactivity to the mood induction than younger

adults, y2(1) = 17.24, p< 0.001.
affect co-occurrence

we determined age group differences in the co-occurrence of
positive and negative affects in response to the mood
induction (aim 3). we calculated mixed emotion (me) scores
using a modification of the minimum value equation (e.g.,
ersner-hershfield et al. 2008). in the original formula, me is

ersner-hershfield et al. 2008). in the original formula, me is
defined as the minimum value of pa or na endorsed by a
participant at a specific time point. for example, if pa= 4 and
na=6ata given time point, the me value for that time point
would be 4. this approach allows for calculation of time point-
specific measures of emotion co-occurrence for each
participant, rather than a correlation based on repeated
sampling. me values reflect the intensity of mixed emotions,
so that the co-occurrence of low levels of both na and pa is
differentiated from the co-occurrence of high levels of na and
pa. the original me formula is impacted by the absolute value
and range of na and pa; thus, we standardized pa and na
before calculating me values.
we added baseline affect and affect reactivity (i.e., affect rating
immediately following the mood induction—baseline affect
rating) to hlm models to determine whether significant age
group differences in recovery remained after controlling for
baseline scores and reactivity to the mood induction. affect
reactivity was a significant predictor of subsequent recovery
for all ten affect scales (tables 5, 6);a significant parameter
estimate for affect reactivity indicates that the extent of

reactivity i is associated with the slope of affect recovery. when

reactivity is associated with the slope of affect recovery. when
controlling for baseline affect and affect reactivity, there were
no longer age group differences in affect recovery.
independent of age group, greater reactivity was associated
with a steeper recovery slope for negative and positive affects.
reactivity variables accounted for a large amount of additional

variance in the slope of affect recovery in na, pseudo-r2 =

0.61, and hostility, pseudo-r2 =0.77.
consistent with our hypothesis, older adults evidenced greater
recovery in na and hostility as compared to younger adults
(table 5, fig. 2a). whereas younger (y= - 0.051, se= 0.0079, p
< 0.001) and older adults (y= - 0.11, se= 0.011, p< 0.001)

the recovery period, as evidenced by significant parameter
estimates for the time variable in baseline models (tables 5,

momentary affect was measured using the positive and
negative affect schedule—expanded form (panas-x; watson

positive affect (pa) and negative affect (na), as well as four

positive affects (i.e., joviality, self-assurance, attentiveness,

positive affects (i.e., joviality, self-assurance, attentiveness,
serenity) and four negative affects (i.e., fear, sadness, guilt,

moment,” from 1 (very slightly or not at all) to 5 (extremely).
the pa and na scales are quasi-independent (rs = - 0.05 to -
0.35). internal consistency is adequate for pa (a= 0.87), na (a
= 0.85), the positive affects (as = 0.72 to 0.93), and the negative
affects (as = 0.80 to 0.88). the fear, hostility, sadness, and
fatigue subscales of the panas-x are highly correlated (rs =
0.85 to 0.91) with conceptually similar scales of the profile of
mood states (poms; mcnair et al. 1971).

this study determined age group differences in affective
reactivity and recovery in a variety of affects in the minutes
following a negative mood induction. we define affect
reactivity as the change in affect from immediately before to
immediately after a mood induction; we define affect recovery
as the change in affect from immediately after the mood
induction to after a recovery period. we compared older and
younger adults in affective reactivity and recovery, as well as
in co-occurrence of pa and na. we used multi-item scales of
several negative and positive affects, collected at several time
points, to gain a comprehensive and reliable assessment of age
group differences in affective responses. our first two aims
determined age group differences in affective reactivity (aim

1) and recovery (aim 2) in several negative and positive

affects. though we did not expect significant age group
differences in affect reactivity (i.e., change in affect between
baseline and immediately following the negative mood
induction), it was necessary to examine reactivity in order to
fully characterize the course of affective responses to the
mood induction. with regard to aim 2, we hypothesized that
older adults would recover more efficiently from the negative
mood induction than younger adults. that is, we expected that
older adults would have a steeper slope of change in affect (i.e.,
greater increase in positive affects and greater decrease in
negative affects) than younger adults during the recovery
period. our third aim focused on determining age group
differences in the presence of mixed affective experiences
after the mood induction. we expected that older adults would

studies do not find these age group differences (brose et al.
2015; hay and diehl 2011; scott et al. 2014). these studies

measured variation in affect over days. to date, only one study
examined age group differences in emotion co-occurrence in
the setting of a negative mood induction. in response toa
mood induction using personal narratives of sadness, older
and younger adults did not evidence different levels of positive
and negative emotion co-occurrence (magai et al. 2006).
however, narrative mood inductions are less potent than other
stimuli, such as film clips (gross and levenson 1995), and
thus, it is not yet clear whether older adults endorse greater
co-occurrence of negative and positive emotion than younger
persons during the immediate reaction to a negative mood

induction using film clips.
sst (e.g., carstensen et al. 2003) posits that greater salience of
emotional stimuli, and thus greater emphasis on both positive
and negative emotional cues, may result in increased affect
complexity—or increased co-occurrence of negative with
positive emotions in daily function—in older adults (charles
2005). the strength and vulnerability integration model

adulthood may allow for increased associations between
present and past experiences (charles 2010). increased
associations between life experiences may strengthen
associative networks between emotions and may generate
more heterogeneous responses to emotional experiences.
co-occurrence of positive and negative affect

we also determined age group differences in the co-
occurrence of positive and negative affect following the
negative mood induction. affect co-occurrence refers to the
simultaneous experience of emotions of different valence (e.g.,
feeling sad and happy). theories of emotional and adult
development suggest that there are emotion regulation
benefits associated with affect co-occurrence. for example,
according to the dynamic model of affect, greater positive
emotions during a response to negative experiences may
support effective emotion regulation (e.g., finan et al. 2011;
reich et al. 2003). the benefit of affect co-occurrence may be
related to direct effects of positive emotions during negative

situations; for example, the presence of positive emotions may

situations; for example, the presence of positive emotions may
support efforts to reappraise a situation in a less distressing
way. indeed, positive emotions are associated with a host of
positive outcomes, including restoration of physiological
equilibrium and undoing of negative emotions (finan et al.
2011; fredrickson et al. 2000; tugade et al. 2014).
thus, there is some evidence that older adults report greater
short-term emotion recovery from negative affective states.
however, except for ready and santorelli (2016), these studies
measured affect on a binary scale from negative to positive
(larcom and isaacowitz 2009; stanley and isaacowitz 2011).
the current study examined spontaneous recovery—in the
minutes following a mood induction—for a number of positive
and negative affects. this approach allowed for independent
estimation of change in multiple affects of different valence,
rather than change in overall mood. studying affective
responses in a laboratory setting allows for standardization of
the stimulus and increases the likelihood of isolating age
group differences, rather than differences related to the type

and duration of negative affective stimuli.
thue there ic came evidence that alder adults renort sreater
preliminary data indicate that the benefits that older adults
experience in emotion recovery—which are consistent with
sst and supported by empirical data—are present in the
immediate aftermath of a negative emotional experience. for

immediate aftermath of a negative emotional experience. for
example, midlife and older adults recovered more quickly after
a laboratory mood induction with regard to positive affect (i.e.,
assurance) than younger adults (ready and santorelli 2016).
additionally, when induced into a negative mood using music,
older adults were more likely than younger adults to be
classified as “rapid regulators” (ie., defined as having
returned to a neutral or positive mood just a few minutes after
a negative mood induction; larcom and isaacowitz 2009).
finally, older adults were more likely than younger adults to
report an increasingly positive mood trajectory following a
negative mood induction (stanley and isaacowitz 2011) and to
rate a neutral video as neutral—as opposed to unpleasant—

following negative film clips (fernandez-aguilar et al. 2018).
emotion recovery from a negative emotional experience may
also improve over the lifespan. specifically, older adults report
quicker affect recovery (i.e., reduction in negative affect and
increase in positive affect) from high arousal emotional
situations in daily life and spend more time in low arousal
negative affective states than in high arousal negative
affective states, relative to younger adults (hay and diehl

2011). compared to younger adults, older adults are more
arrective states, relative to younger aauits (hay ana vient

2011). compared to younger adults, older adults are more
likely to sustain the absence of negative emotions, to move
from high negative to low negative emotional states over time
(carstensen et al. 2000), and to spontaneously recover
positive affect more quickly in the hours following a stressful
event in daily life (scott et al. 2013). greater capacity for
emotion recovery following negative events in older than
younger adults may reflect an increased focus on achieving
emotional homeostasis in old age, as posited by sst
(carstensen et al. 2003).
age and emotion reactivity and recovery

age-related advantages in emotional well-being do not simply
reflect lower emotional intensity or lesser emotion reactivity
in older relative to younger persons. indeed, older adults
experience similar subjective reactivity to emotion stimuli as
younger adults. for example, relative to younger persons,
older adults report comparable levels of negative emotion in
response to criticism (charles and carstensen 2008), negative
pictures (streubel and kunzmann 2011), unpleasant events
(rocke et al. 2009; stawski et al. 2008), and film clips about
interpersonal loss (ready and santorelli 2016; tsai et al.
2000). further, older persons may even endorse greater
ratings of unpleasantness than younger adults in response to
sadness-eliciting pictures (streubel and kunzmann 2011) and

sadness-eliciting pictures (streubel and kunzmann 2011) and
fear- and disgust-inducing film clips (fernandez-aguilar et
al. 2018), as well as greater ratings of sadness in response to
film clips about age-relevant losses (e.g., death of a spouse;
kunzmann and griihn 2005). thus, adults maintain the
ability to mount emotional responses in a variety of negative
situations into old age.
older adults report better emotional well-being than younger
and midlife adults (e.g., carstensen et al. 2011). overall, older
adults endorse less negative affect (e.g., carstensen et al.
2000; charles et al. 2001; ready et al. 2011) anda higher ratio
of positive to negative affect in comparison with midlife and
younger adults (carstensen et al. 2011). socioemotional
selectivity theory (sst) posits that adults become aware of
limited time left in life as they age and thus they prioritize
emotional goals rather than achievement goals (carstensen et
al. 2003). a greater focus on emotional well-being with age
may result in increased attention to emotional stimuli, as well

as more emphasis on maintaining emotional homenstasis in
may result in increased attention to emotional stimuli, as well

as more emphasis on maintaining emotional homeostasis in
older compared to younger adults (e.g., carstensen et al. 2003;
mikels et al. 2014). older adults have the ability to regulate
negative emotions when instructed to use response
modulation strategies (e.g., thinking about the situation ina
more positive way) in the setting of laboratory mood
inductions (brady et al. 2018; livingstone and isaacowitz
2018). it is not yet established, however, if older and younger
adults spontaneously respond to and recover froma
standardized mood induction in a similar manner. the present
study addressed this gap in the literature by determining adult
age group differences in spontaneous responses—in a variety
of negative and positive affects—immediately following a
negative laboratory mood induction.
