mic data from 76 japanese clinical isolates of a. fumigatus to identify loci
involved in itcz sensitivity. mic values fell within a relatively tight range of
0.125-1 pg/ml [for reference, itcz resistant strains are defined by mics > 4
ig/ml (tashiro et al., 2012)]. we reasoned that gwa could be a feasible tool
to identify loci that contribute to the small differences in itcz mic we
observed across these clinical isolates. we identified several candidate snps
and loci associated with itcz sensitivity, and validated the function of the
top candidate by knocking it out using a crispr/cas9 based approach.

we identified a synonymous variant in afu2g02220 that showed highly
significant associations with itcz sensitivity across gwa analyses with
different underlying statistical models (figure 2). synonymous mutations can
be functional through their (i) effect on cis-regulatory regions (e.g., splice
sites or mirna and exonic transcription factor binding sites), (i) alteration of
mrna structure, or (ii) influence on translation speed (e.g., codon usage)
(hunt et al, 2014). determining the mechanism by which this variant alters
phenotype would require extensive in silico and in vitro experimentation.
afu2g02220 encodes a predicted sterol glycosyltransferase. this enzyme
biosynthesizes sterol glucosides, which make up the common eukaryotic
membrane bound lipids. orthologs of afu2g02220 from the ascomycete
yeasts saccharomyces cerevisiae (atg26), candida albicans, pichia pastoris,
as well as the amoeba dictyostelium discoideum can use various sterols,
including ergosterol, as sugar acceptors (warnecke et al., 1999). in s.
cerevisiae, atg26 can directly bind to and glycosylate ergosterol, which yields
ergosterol-glucoside (gallego et al., 2010). in s. cerevisiae aatg26 did not
as well as the amoeba dictyostelium discoideum can use various sterols,
including ergosterol, as sugar acceptors (warnecke et al., 1999). in s.
cerevisiae, atg26 can directly bind to and glycosylate ergosterol, which yields
ergosterol-glucoside (gallego et al., 2010). in s. cerevisiae aatg26 did not
impair growth when cultured in complex or minimal media, low or elevated
temperatures, varying osmotic stress conditions, or in the presence of
nystatin, an antifungal drug that binds to ergosterol (warnecke et al., 1999).
similarly, we did not observe a difference in growth rate between
aafu2g02220 and the wt when grown in minimal media (figure 3c)..

in addition to its role in sterol modification, afu2g02220 may also have
additional functions related to autophagy (kikuma et al., 2017). orthologs of
afu2g02220 in pichia pastoris (ppatg26) (oku et al., 2003), colletotrichum
orbiculare (coatg26) (asakura et al., 2009) and aspergillus oryzae (aoatg26)
(kikuma et al., 2017) are required for autophagy. in a. oryzae, aaoatg26
shows deficiency in degradation of peroxisomes, mitochondria, and nuclei
and localizes to vacuoles (kikura et al., 2017). aaoatg26 also shows
reductions in conidiation and impairment of aerial hyphae formation (kikuma
et al,, 2017). similarly, we observed a reduction in condition in aafu2g02220
compared to the wt (supplementary figure 6).

the fungal cell wall is rigid but also dynamic in order to respond to
environmental stress. because afu2g02220 may directly interact with
ergosterol, we hypothesized that environmental stress could alter the
expression of afu2g02220. we analyzed a. fumigatus rna-seq data during
arowth under iron depletion oxidative stress itc7 exnosure and arowth in
environmental stress. because afu2g02220 may directly interact with
ergosterol, we hypothesized that environmental stress could alter the
expression of afu2g02220. we analyzed a. fumigatus rna-seq data during
growth under iron depletion, oxidative stress, itcz exposure and growth in
blood and minimal media (stajich et al., 2012). we found that afu2g02220
expression was significantly up-regulated during oxidative stress, iron
depletion and itcz exposure (supplementary figure 5). however, other
studies examining gene expression (da silva ferreira et al., 2006; hokken et
al, 2019) or protein abundance (amarsaikhan et al., 2017) during exposure
to itcz and voriconazole (da silva ferreira et al., 2006) (another triazole with
the same mechanism of action as itcz) did not observe differential
abundance of the afu2g02220 transcript or protein. additional experiments
are necessary to determine the precise role of afu2g02220 in stress
response and itcz sensitivity.

previously, palma-guerrero et al. (2013) used a similar approach to identify
ncu04379 as a gene that contributes to fungal communication in n. crassa.
this study used rna-seq data to identify genetic variants, fisher's exact tests
to perform gwa in a closely related group of 112 isolates, and existing
deletion mutants generated by the neurospora genome project (colot et al.,
2006; dunlap et al., 2007) to validate the involvement of ncu04379 in
cellular communication during germling fusion. a study in s. cerevisiae used
a mixed linear model to identify correlations between genotype and
tolerance to hydrolysate toxins, and used homologous recombination to
knockout candidate genes in two independent genetic backgrounds (sardi et
cellular communication during germung tusion. a stuay in. cerevisiae used
a mixed linear model to identify correlations between genotype and
tolerance to hydrolysate toxins, and used homologous recombination to
knockout candidate genes in two independent genetic backgrounds (sardi et
al, 2018). interestingly, eight of 14 gene knockouts had a significant effect
on phenotype in one, but not both genetic backgrounds, suggesting that the
network of genes contributing to hydrolysate toxins tolerance likely differs
between genetic backgrounds. the results of these studies, and of our own,
broadly suggest that gwa in combination with an efficient gene disruption
technique is a powerful and unbiased approach for identifying the genetic
basis of polygenic phenotypes in fungal systems.
discussion
to test the effect of afu2902220 on itcz sensitivity, we grew the wild type
(wt) and aafu2g02220 strains in the presence of 0.15 jig/ml of itcz and
measured colony diameter after 72 h of incubation at 37°c. we observed a
qualitative reduction in conidia production in ko strains (supplementary
figure 6). in minimal media without itcz aafu2g02220-1 and aafu2g02220-
2 growth rates did not significantly differ from the wt (aafu2g02220-1 =
45.016 + 0.027 mm, aafu2g02220-2 = 45.018 + 0.030 mm, wt = 44.994 +
0.024 mm) (figure 3). this result suggests that the background growth rate
of aafu2g02220 is not impacted by the gene deletion. however, at itcz
concentrations of 0.15 jig/ml we observed a minor but consistent reduction
in growth in ko strains compared to wt (aafu2g02220-1 = 18.594 + 0.105
mm, aafu2g02220-1 = 18.615 + 0.022 mm, wt = 19.239 + 0.021 mm) (p-
value = 2e™*6 for both kos) (figure 3d). these results suggest that
afu2g02220 plays a minor role in itcz sensitivity.

we chose to functionally examine the role of afu2g02220 because (i) the
snp located in this gene had highly significant p-values in both gwa
analyses (ii) afu2g02220 has a predicted functional role in sterol metabolism,
and itcz targets the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway and (iii) afu2g02220
was up-regulated during itcz exposure (supplementary figure 5). thus, we
used an established crispr/cas9 method (al abdallah et al., 2017) to
knockout (ko) afu2g02220 by replacing it with the indicator gene
hygromycin b phosphotransferase (hyg) in the a. fumigatus cea10 genetic
background (figure 3a). we generated two independent kos of afu2g02220
which we validated by via pcr (figure 38).
expression of afu2g02220 and afu2g02140 from existing rna-seq
experiments

to investigate whether gene expression of afu2g02220 and afu2g02140
could be modulated by environmental stress, we analyzed a. fumigatus rna-
seq data publicly available on fungidb (stajich et al., 2012), during oxidative
stress, iron depletion, itcz exposure, and growth in blood and minimal
media (irmer et al., 2015; kurucz et al., 2018). afu2g02220 was up-regulated
during iron starvation (fpkmcontrot = 20.33, fpkmrestarvation = 32.70, and p-
value = 5.7e~), oxidative stress induced by h2o2 (fpkmcontrot = 20.33,
fpkmy202 = 30.61, and p-value = 2.7e~), iron starvation + h2o2 (fpkmcontrot
= 20.33, fpkmrestarvation+#i202 = 39.93, and p-value = 6.7e"?5), and during
exposure to itcz in strain a1160 (fpkm.ircz = 48.20, fpkmsircz = 67.37, and
p-value = 1.7e~) (supplementary figures 5a,b). afu2g02140 was not
significantly up-regulated during any condition, and expressed at lower
levels across all conditions compared to afu2g02220 (supplementary figure
5).

of the 20 snps significantly associated with itcz mic when mic was treated
as a binary trait (figure 28), 12 snps were located in genes (11 in exons and
one in an intron), two snps were located in 3’ utr regions, 1 snp was
located in a 5’ utr regions, and 4 snps were located in intergenic regions
(table 1). of the 11 snps located in exons, six were synonymous (in

the remaining five were non-synonymous (in afu2g01930, afu2g02140, and
afu2g01910) (table 1). interestingly, in this analysis, 19 of the 20 snps with
lowest p-values were located to a 165 kb region on chromosome 2 (position
413,387 — 579,284) (figure 28).

two significant snps overlapped between the quantitative trait and binary
trait gwa analyses (figure 2c). the snp located in afu2g02220 encodes a
synonymous variant and had the ninth lowest and lowest p-values in the
quantitative trait and binary trait analyses, respectively (figures 24,8).
afu2g02220 is annotated as a sterol 3-b-glucosyltransferase (table 1). the
snp located in afu2g02140 encodes a non-synonymous variant (a233g) and
had the 10th lowest and seventh lowest p-values in the quantitative trait and
binary trait analyses, respectively (figures 2a,8). afu2g02140 contains a cue
domain (as predicted by pfam) (el-gebali et al., 2019), which has been
shown to bind to ubiquitin (donaldson et al., 2003; shih et al,, 2003). for
both afu2g02220 and afu2g02140, the major allele was associated with
higher mic values and the minor allele was absent in all isolates with itcz
mic = 1, and nearly absent in isolates with itcz mic = 0.5 (figure 2d,
supplementary figure 4).

variants with minor contributions to itcz sensitivity. to test this hypothesis,
we performed gwa with a set of 68,853 snps that have a minor allele
frequency >5% and < 10% missing data, and the matched itcz mics.
because these isolates have clear population structure (figure 1) we used a
mixed effect model gwa, which can reduce the inflated false-positive effect
stemming from population structure (yu et al., 2006; price et al., 2010;
power et al., 2017) and has previously been applied in microbial gwa (alam
et al, 2014; earle et al., 2016). we performed this mixed-model gwa with a
covariance matrix as population correction for itcz mic when treated as a
stemming from population structure (yu et al., 2006; price et al., 2010;
power et al., 2017) and has previously been applied in microbial gwa (alam
et al, 2014; earle et al., 2016). we performed this mixed-model gwa with a
covariance matrix as population correction for itcz mic when treated as a
quantitative trait (figure 2a) and as a binary trait (figure 28) using tassel 5
(bradbury et al., 2007) and roadtrips (thornton and mcpeek, 2010),
respectively. we generated quantile-quantile (q-q) plots of expected vs.
observed p-values to inspect p-value inflation, which could be the product
of inadequate population structure correction. the q-q plots indicate that
the distribution of p-values for both analyses are not inflated (supplementary
figure 3).

was treated as a binary trait ("more-sensitive” = mic < 0.5 or “less-sensitive”

population structure of cl al a. fumigatus isolates from japan

we conducted whole genome sequencing (wgs) for 65 isolates of a.
fumigatus from japan and analyzed them in combination with an additional
11 previously sequenced isolates (takahashi-nakaguchi et al., 2015)
deduplicated, quality trimmed, and adapter trimmed wgs data of the 76
isolates were used for joint snp calling with gatk (mckenna et al., 2010) and
yielded 206,055 snps. to reduce the linkage between adjacent snps for
population structure analysis, we subsampled snps so that they were
separated by at least 3.5 kb, which yielded 6,324 snps. this subsampled
dataset was used for population structure and phylogenetic analysis.

population structure is a main confounding factor in gwa studies that can
lead to false positive associations (sul et al., 2018). therefore, we
investigated the population structure of the 76 a. fumigatus isolates using
the model-based approach implemented in admixture (alexander et al.,
2009), as well as a non-model approach where population structure is
inferred using discriminant analysis of principal components (dapc)
(jombart et al., 2010). in admixture, cross-validation (cv) error was
estimated for each k from k = 1-10. the cv error is calculated by
systematically withholding data points, and the lowest value represents the
best estimate of the number of ancestral populations (alexander and lange,
2011). using this approach k = 4 was the most likely population number
(figure 14). dapc uses the bayesian information criterion (bic) to evaluate
the optimal number of clusters (k). k = 4 was also the most likely scenario as
evaluated by bic in dapc (figure 18). population assignment was highly
consistent when the entire snp set was used, or when subsampled datasets
(figure 14). dapc uses the bayesian information criterion (bic) to evaluate
the optimal number of clusters (k). k = 4 was also the most likely scenario as
evaluated by bic in dapc (figure 18). population assignment was highly
consistent when the entire snp set was used, or when subsampled datasets
consisting of 6,324 or 756 markers were used to limit linkage between
markers (supplementary figure 1). at k= 4, dapc assigned the 76 isolates
into four distinct populations with no admixture, while admixture assigned
30 of 76 individuals to more than one population. for population
assignment, we placed isolates into their respective population based on
their largest membership coefficient. using this approach, only two isolates,
ifm51978 and ifm61610 (figure 1c, indicated by black arrows), were
assigned into different populations between the two methods. phylogenetic
network analysis further supports the presence of four main populations and
individual population assignment into these populations (supplementary
figure 2).

comparison of itcz sensitivity between wt and ko strains

colony diameter was used as an estimate of growth rate to compare ko and
wt strains in the presence and absence of itcz. for each strain, 104 conidia
were inoculated onto glucose minimal media (gmm) agar plates without
itcz or with 0.15 g/ml itcz. we used 0.15 jig/ml itcz because the parent
strain (cea10) is sensitive to itcz and did not grow in itcz concentrations >
0.30 jig/ml. gmm was prepared as previously described (shimizu and keller,
2001). colony diameter was measured with a digital caliper after 72 h at
37°c. experiments were performed with ten replicates. to compare the
growth rate between wt and ko strains, an anova was performed between
wt, aafu2g02220-1, and aafu2g02220-2 followed by a post-hoc dunnett's
test using the wt as the control group. statistical analysis was conducted
using jmp®, pro 14 (sas institute inc., cary, nc, 1989-2019)

gene deletion of afu2g02220 in a. fumigatus cea10

a. fumigatus strain cea10 was used as the genetic background for the
deletion of afu2g02220. the deletion was carried out using a clustered
regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (crispr)/cas9-mediated
protocol for gene editing, as previously described (al abdallah et al., 2017).
briefly, two protospacer adjacent motif (pam) sites, at both upstream and
downstream of afu2g02220, were selected using the eupagdt tool (peng
and tarleton, 2015) and custom crrnas were designed using the 20 base
pairs of sequence immediately upstream of the pam site. the crrnas used
are as follows: 5' crrna of afu2g02220 = ctgttattttcttcgggtct and 3

purchased from idt (integrated dna technologies, inc.). complete
guidernas (grnas) were then assembled in vitro using the custom designed
crrna coupled with a commercially acquired tracrrna. the assembled
qrnas were then combined with commercially purchased cas9 to form
ribonucleoproteins for transformation, as previously described (al abdallah
et al,, 2017). repair templates carrying a hygromycin resistance (hygr)
cassette were pcr amplified to contain 40-basepair regions of
microhomology on either side for homologous integration at the double
strand dna break induced by the cas9 nuclease. protoplast-mediated
transformations were then carried out using the hygromycin repair templates
and cas-ribonucleoproteins for gene targeting. homologous integrations
were confirmed by pcr. the primers used are as follows

to investigate the expression patterns of our candidate genes afu2g02220
and afu2g02140, we obtained fpkm values as well as fold-change and p-
values for pairwise comparisons from fungidb
(https://fungidb.org/fungidb/) (stajich et al., 2012) for oxidative stress, iron
depletion, growth in blood and minimal media, and itcz exposure (irmer et
al,, 2015; kurucz et al., 2018).
 

genome-wide association analysis for itraconazole sensitivity

genome wide association (gwa) analysis was conducted to identify genetic
variants that were significantly correlated with itcz mic. for gwa analysis,
we filtered our complete set of snps with vcftools to include snps with a
minor allele frequency 25%, snp sites with < 10% missing data, and snps that
were biallelic. this filtering procedure resulted in 68,853 snps that were used
for gwa.

two models were used to perform gwa between each of the 68,853 snps
and itcz mic. when itcz mic data was treated as a quantitative trait
(supplementary table 1), we used a linear mixed model with a genetic
distance matrix for population structure correction in tassel (bradbury et al.,
2007). gwa was also performed when itcz mic was treated as a binary trait
(mic < 0.5 = more sensitive, and mic > 0.5 = less sensitive). in this gwa
analysis, we used a mixed effect logistic model with an empirical covariance
matrix as a population structure correction in roadtrips (thornton and
mcpeek, 2010). quantile-quantile(q-q) plots were generated using the r
package “qgman’ (turner, 2014) in order to evaluate potential p-value
inflation. the potential functional effects of candidate snps were predicted
using snpeff v4.3t (cingolani et al., 2012) with the a. fumigatus af293
reference genome annotation.

population structure of a. fumigatus isolates

to investigate the population structure of the a. fumigatus isolates we used a
subset of population genetic informative snps. we used vcftools v0.1.14
(danecek et al., 2011) (http://vcftools.sourceforge.net/) with options “-maf
0.05 ~max-missing 1 —thin 3500," to filter the full set of snps and require a
minor allele frequency 2 5%, no missing data across all samples, and at least
3.5 kb distance between snps. 6,324 snps remained after filtering, and
subsequent population structure analysis was conducted with this marker
set. in addition, to test the consistency of population assignments with
different number of snps, population structure analysis was conducted with

 

subsequent population structure analysis was conducted with this marker
set. in addition, to test the consistency of population assignments with
different number of snps, population structure analysis was conducted with
a dense snp set where thinning was not applied (59,433 snp sites) and an
additional thinned snp set where markers were spaced apart by at least 35
kb (756 snps)

to conduct population structure analysis, we first used the model-based
program admixture v1.3 (alexander et al., 2009) for k = 1-10, where k
indicates the number of populations. the 5-fold cross-validation (cv)
procedure was calculated to find the most likely k with option “-cv = 5." for
each k the cv error was calculated and the k with lowest cv error indicated
the most likely population number. additionally, we used the non-model
based population structure software dapc (jombart et al, 2010) in the
“adegenet” package v2.1.2 (jombart, 2008) in r v3.5.3 (team, 2013) to the
predict the number and assignment of individuals into populations. dapc
applies a bayesian clustering method to identify populations without
evolutionary models. the most likely number of populations was inferred by
calculating the bayesian information criterion (bic) for each k.

lastly, we also constructed a phylogenetic network with the alignment of
6,324 snps. the phylogenetic network was built using splitstree v4.14.4
(huson and bryant, 2006) with the neighbor joining method and 1,000
replicates for bootstrap analysis.
snp genotyping

because a. fumigatus is haploid, we followed the best practice pipeline for

because a. fumigatus is haploid, we followed the best practice pipeline for
*germline short variant discovery’ (van der auwera et al., 2013) in genome
analysis toolkit (gatk) v4.0.6.0 (mckenna et al., 2010). the function
“haplotypecaller” was used to call short variants (snps and indels) with the
sorted bam file for each sample. the resulting g.vcf files of all 76 samples
were then combined to generate a joint-called variant file using the function
"genotypegvcfs.” next only snps were extracted from the joint-called
variant file using the function “selectvariants.” to limit false positive variant
calling, the function “variantfiltration” was used to carry out “hard filtering”
with the following parameters: “qd < 25.0 || fs > 5.0 || m@< 55.0 ||
mqranksum < -0.5 || readposranksum < -2.0 || sor > 2.5". 206,055
polymorphic loci were predicted after hard filtering.
quality control and sequence read mapping

raw reads were first deduplicated using tally (davis et al., 2013) with the
parameters "—with-quality” and "-pair-by-offset” to remove potential pcr
duplication during library construction. next, we used trim_galore v0.4.2
(http://www. bioinformatics. babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/) to trim
residual adapter sequences from reads, and trim reads where quality score
was below 30, with the parameters "-stringency 5" and *-q 30,” respectively.
trimmed reads shorter than 50 bp were then discarded using the option "—
length 50.” next, the deduplicated and trimmed read set was mapped to the
a fumigatus af293 reference genome (nierman et al., 2005) using bwa-mem
v0.7.5 aligner (li and durbin, 2009). the resulting sam files were converted
into sorted bam files using the “view’ and “sort” functions in samtools 1.4.1 (li
et al, 2009).
dna extraction and illumina whole-genome sequencing

genomic dna (gdna) isolation was performed as previously described
(zhao et al., 2019). dna was directly isolated from conidia stocks using the
masterpure™ yeast dna purification kit (lucigen/epicenter) following the
manufacturer's instructions, with several minor modifications. conidia stocks
were centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min to obtain a pellet. next, 300 ml of
yeast cell lysis solution was added to the pellet along with 0.4 ml of sterile
1.0 mm diameter silica beads. lysis was carried out on a biospec mini-
beadbeater-8 at medium intensity for 8 min. one il of rnase was added to
the cell lysis solution and incubated at 65°c for 30 min. dna isolation and
purification were conducted according to the manufacturer's instructions for
the remainder of the protocol. pcr-free 150-bp paired-end libraries were
constructed and sequenced by novogene (https://en.novogene.com/) on

conidia. harvested conidia were suspended in standard rpmi 1640 broth (ph

concentrations (8, 4, 2, 1, 0.5, 0.25, 0.125, 0.0625, 0.03125, 0.015625 jig/ml)
at 35°c for 48 h. mic values represent the lowest itcz concentrations that

sixty-five japanese a. fumigatus clinical strains were provided through the
national bio-resource project (nbrp), japan (http://nbrp.ip/)
(supplementary table 1). these samples originated from different patients,
several different sources and infections, and 15 cities. whole genome paired-

fungal infections result in more global deaths per year than deaths from
tuberculosis or malaria (brown et al., 2012). aspergillus fumigatus is one of
the most deadly fungal pathogens and results in more than 100,000 deaths
per year (brown et al., 2012). invasive aspergillosis (ia) is the most severe
infection caused by a. fumigatus and occurs when fungal growth, most
commonly originating in the lung, disseminates to other parts of the body via
the bloodstream (latge, 1999). a. fumigatus is an opportunistic pathogen
primarily affecting immunocompromised individuals, and unfortunately,
infections have become more common due to the increased usage of
immunosuppressive drugs to treat autoimmune disorders and to increase
the success of organ transplantation surgery (robinett et al., 2013; neofytos
et al,, 2018; latge and chamilos, 2019). even when aggressively treated with
first and second-line antifungal medication, mortality rates can exceed 50%
in ia patients (latge, 1999; lin et al., 2001). the relatively rapid emergence of
a. fumigatus antifungal resistance has made treatment of infections
particularly challenging.

a. fumigatus antifungal resistance has made treatment of infections

antifungal drugs target components that distinguish fungal cells from
mammalian cells, including the fungal cell wall as well as unique
components of the fungal cell membrane. for example, the echinocandins
target b 1,3 glucan, the most abundant polysaccharide in the fungal cell wall,
while amphotericin b (a polyene class of antifungal drug) and triazoles (an
azole class of antifungal drugs) target ergosterol (latge et al., 2017)
ergosterol plays an essential functional role in regulating cell membrane
permeability and fluidity. triazoles, such as itraconazole (itcz) and
voriconazole, are the most common first-line treatment for a. fumigatus
infections, and target the lanosterol demethylase enzymes (cyps1a and
cyp51b in a. fumigatus) which are directly involved in the biosynthesis of
ergosterol (alcazar-fuoli and mellado, 2013; revie et al., 2018). blocking
cyps1a and cyp518 results in the accumulation of a toxic sterol intermediate
that causes severe membrane stress, impairment of growth, and cell death
(revie et al, 2018).

strains of a. fumigatus have gained resistance to triazoles through mutations
in both the coding and regulatory regions of cyp51a, and through cyp51a
independent mechanisms (garcia-rubio et al., 2017). the three amino acid
positions that are commonly found with non-synonymous mutations in
cyp51a in azole resistance strains are 54, 220, and 448 (garcia-rubio et al.,
in both the coding and regulatory regions of cyp51a, and through cyp51a
independent mechanisms (garcia-rubio et al., 2017). the three amino acid
positions that are commonly found with non-synonymous mutations in
cyp51a in azole resistance strains are 54, 220, and 448 (garcia-rubio et al.,
2017). protein structure modeling suggests that these mutations disrupt the
binding efficiency of azoles to cyps1a (fraczek et al., 2011; warrilow et al.,
2015). increased expression of cyp51a through a combination of a promoter
region repeat and the l98h point mutation can also confer azole resistance
(mellado et al., 2007). additionally, several transcription factors (e.g., srba
(hagiwara et al., 2016), hape (camps et al., 2012), atrr (paul et al., 2019),
transporters [e.g., cdr1b (fraczek et al., 2013), atrf (meneau et al., 2016),
various abc transporters (moye-rowley, 2015) etc.], and other functional
groups of genes (e.g., genes involved in calcium signaling, iron balance,
signaling pathways, and the hsp90-calcineurin pathway) have been
implicated in azole resistance or susceptibility (chen et al., 2020).

the numerous genes identified in azole resistance other than cyp51a
(garcia-rubio et al., 2017) suggests that additional genes with additive minor
effects likely play a role in fine-scale differences in azole sensitivity and
resistance. historically, most genes involved in azole resistance in a.
fumigatus were discovered through a candidate gene approach (garcia~
rubio et al., 2017), or through gene expression differences during exposure
to azoles (da silva ferreira et al., 2006; hokken et al., 2019). however,

candidate gene methods are biased toward genes and pathways of
biological interest. alternatively, genome-wide association (gwa) studies
offer a powerful and versatile approach to identify genetic variants that
contribute to complex traits, such as a. fumigatus itcz sensitivity. in gwa,
thousands to millions of high-density genetic variants are tested for a
statistical association between each variant and a phenotype of interest
(gibson, 2018). microbial gwas methods have recently been developed
(read and massey, 2014; chen and shapiro, 2015; power et al., 2017), and
has been used in other fungal species. for instance, gwa has been used to
identify genes and variants associated with virulence in heterobasidion
annosum (dalman et al., 2013), saccharomyces cerevisiae (muller et al.,
2011), and parastagonospora nodorum (gao et al., 2016), fungal
communication in neurospora crassa (palma-guerrero et al., 2013),
aggressiveness in fusarium graminearum (talas et al., 2016), and
zymoseptoria tritici (hartmann et al., 2017). here, we hypothesized that gwa
could be applied in a. fumigatus to identify genes with minor effects on itcz
sensitivity. we performed gwa in 76 non-resistant clinical isolates of a.
fumigatus and identified a gene that contributes to fine-scale itcz
sensitivity. more broadly, we demonstrate that gwa in combination with
gene disruption is a useful tool for investigating medically relevant traits in a.
fumigatus.
introduction
aspergillus fumigatus is a potentially lethal opportunistic pathogen
that infects over ~200,000 people and causes ~100,000 deaths per
year globally. treating a. fumigatus infections is particularly
challenging because of the recent emergence of azole-resistance.
the majority of studies focusing on the molecular mechanisms
underlying azole resistance have examined azole-resistant isolates.
however, isolates that are susceptible to azoles also display variation
in their sensitivity, presenting a unique opportunity to identify genes
contributing to azole sensitivity. here, we used genome-wide
association (gwa) analysis to identify loci involved in azole
sensitivity by analyzing the association between 68,853 snps and
contributing to azole sensitivity. here, we used genome-wide
association (gwa) analysis to identify loci involved in azole
sensitivity by analyzing the association between 68,853 snps and
itraconazole (itcz) minimum inhibitory concentration (mic) in 76
clinical isolates of a. fumigatus from japan. population structure
analysis suggests the presence of four distinct populations, with
itcz mics distributed relatively evenly across populations. we
independently conducted gwa when treating itcz mic as a
quantitative trait and a binary trait, and identified two snps with
strong associations in both analyses. these snps fell within the
coding regions of afu2g02220 and afu2g02140. we functionally
validated afu2g02220 by knocking it out using a crispr/cas9
approach, because orthologs of this gene are involved in sterol
modification and itcz targets the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway.
knockout strains displayed no difference in growth compared to the
parent strain in minimal media, yet a minor but consistent inhibition
of growth in the presence of 0.15 ig/ml itcz. our results suggest
that gwa paired with efficient gene deletion is a powerful and
unbiased strategy for identifying the genetic basis of complex traits
in a. fumigatus.
