results of the current study highlight the need for multidimensional
assessment of ses when examining the physiological impact of
poverty on children. risk factors indexing unsafe or unpredictable
environments explained child diurnal and chronic cortisol function
above and beyond parent biological stress and global ses indicators
like income. this finding has implications even beyond the study of
ses. large-scale events such as the covid-19 pandemic and its
accompanying economic repercussions may represent a risk to
children's hpa axis development by pushing more families into
poverty and food insecurity. however, even for families with sufficient
material resources, pandemics, natural disasters, and other
cataclysmic events may greatly increase parents’ experience of their
world as unpredictable and unsafe. for young children, this
environmental uncertainty may be associated with elevated and
dysregulated cortisol, with potential long-term consequences for
biological stress vulnerability. further work is needed to develop a
mechanistic understanding of how proximal ses risks relate to the
hpa axis and to determine the malleability of cortisol function in
response to interventions that address proximal ses risks such as

food insecurity and household chaos.

for children in low-ses families and any children experiencing
upheaval and adversity, empirically supported interventions are
needed to reduce the impacts of poverty and establish a safe,
predictable context for children and their parents. the current
correlational study does not demonstrate causality, and so it will be
critical to determine if changing specific ses risks will change child
cortisol function. promisingly, young children whose families had
participated in a cash transfer program had lower salivary cortisol
levels than those who had not (fernald & gunnar, 2009). while our
current results suggest that income may be a proxy for associated
proximal ses risks, increasing income may well have ripple effects
that mitigate those risks. given the observed association of food
insecurity with flattened diurnal slope, it will also be important to
determine if changes to food stamp eligibility or to the availability of
free school lunch programs impact child cortisol regulation.

 
a strength of this study is that we measured both hair cortisol and
three indices of diurnal salivary cortisol. however, it is difficult for any
one study to comprehensively assess the hpa axis. we did not
measure stress reactivity to challenge. we also took only one morning
sample and therefore did not adequately capture the car, which prior
research has found to be blunted in lower ses children (zhu et al.,
2019). an extension of this research would be to characterize how
cortisol reactivity and the car relate to multidimensional ses
indicators in early childhood.
we tested both 12-month-olds and 3.5-year-olds because we
anticipated potential developmental differences in how ses related to
cortisol, given developmental change in the hpa axis. there were the
expected developmental changes in the hpa axis, such that infant
hcc was higher than 3.5-year-old hcc. however, there were not
pronounced developmental differences in the ways in which ses.
related to cortisol function. for both infants and 3.5-year-olds, parent
education uniquely related to hcc and household chaos uniquely
related to bedtime scc. patterns of association were similar,
suggesting that sensitivity of the hpa axis to these multidimensional
ses risks is relatively stable through early childhood. the cross-
sectional design is a limitation of this study, however. longitudinal
studies are needed to characterize developmental pathways of
cortisol function in the context of ses, including determining the
implications of early ses for later cortisol function and examining
whether changes in ses predict changes in cortisol function over
time. further, it will be critical to conduct similar research with diverse

implications of early ses for later cortisol function and examining
whether changes in ses predict changes in cortisol function over
time. further, it will be critical to conduct similar research with diverse
populations to determine the generalizability of these associations
across developmental time, cultural context, and severity of risks
experienced. for example, children in low- and middle-income
countries who experience more extreme poverty-related stressors
may be more apt to show attenuation of hpa activity in the face of
prolonged severe stress, and thus the nature of associations between
ses and cortisol may be expected to differ. our sample was racially
and ethnically diverse but did not have sufficient numbers of particular
racial/ethnic groups within age bands to allow for disentangling the
effects of race and ses. it would be valuable for future studies to
recruit a socioeconomically diverse sample within a single racial or
ethnic group, or to have a large sample with enough participants of
each race tested to allow for statistical comparisons. finally, the

ses on child cortisol function was not supported. this expectation
was informed by prior research linking lower parental sensitivity to
higher child cortisol output, as indexed by both salivary and hair
measures (blair et al., 2011; johnson et al., 2018; simmons et al.,
2019; zalewski et al., 2012). in our sample, consistent with this prior
work, lower parental sensitivity was associated with higher child hcc
and higher bedtime scc. however, parental sensitivity did not
mediate links between ses measures and these cortisol indices. it
should also be noted that most of the previous research was with
toddlers and preschool children, and parental sensitivity was unrelated
to cortisol function in our infant sample. one possible explanation for
these null results is methodological. parental sensitivity was assessed
during a free play interaction, a structured teaching task, and a brief
cleanup task. while the teaching and cleanup tasks were intended to
be similar to daily challenges that parent-child dyads encounter and
to elicit a wider variety of parental behavior, this did not represent the
full range of situations that parents navigate on a daily basis. given

them regulate f hpa activity in the face of challenges (gunnar, 2017),

full range of situations that parents navigate on a daily basis. given

that parents serve as social buffers for their young children to help
them regulate hpa activity in the face of challenges (gunnar, 2017),
parental sensitivity during stressful situations that are likely to activate
the hpa axis, such as drop-off at a new daycare or restraining an
unwilling child in a car seat, may be most pertinent to the
incorporation of ses-related risk into hpa function. for instance, to
better understand ses links to bedtime scc, it may be illuminating to
assess parental sensitivity during the evening meal and while getting
the child ready for bed, contexts which are likely to elicit parent-child
struggles. unpredictability should also be considered as a potential
underlying mechanism. unpredictability in parenting behavior, in who
provides care to the child, and in the child's day-to-day experience
could contribute to cortisol dysregulation and will be important to
measure in future studies. it is possible that parenting is not a primary
mechanism underlying ses associations with child cortisol, but before
concluding this, it will be important for future research to observe
parents in situations in which social buffering is required.
overall, results support the sensitivity of hcc to a wide range of ses
indicators. hcc was correlated with five out of six ses indicators
studied in infants and three out of six indicators in 3.5-year-olds. by
contrast, correlations of ses measures with the diurnal salivary
measures were more scattered. among 3.5-year-olds, none of the
ses indicators were related to salivary aucg, one of the most widely
used cortisol indices in developmental research. results suggest that
in infancy and early childhood, hcc may be a more reliable index
than salivary cortisol of the cumulative impact of ses on cortisol
function. this may in large part be a reflection of the challenges of
reliably measuring diurnal salivary cortisol in early childhood. that is,
itis possible that hcc appeared more robustly related to ses.
because hcc was more accurately measured. while we took many
steps to increase the accuracy of our salivary measures, including

because hcc was more accurately measured. while we took many
steps to increase the accuracy of our salivary measures, including
correcting for actigraphy-derived time since wake; objectively
measuring sampling times; excluding samples when the child was ill;
and texting with parents to support accurate and timely sampling,
room for error remains. further, even if perfectly measured, salivary
cortisol levels vary widely from day to day and averaging across a few
days of sampling will not provide as stable a measure as hcc. yet
hcc and diurnal cortisol appeared to have a different pattern of
sensitivity to ses, with household chaos disrupting diurnal rhythms
but not playing as much of a role in chronic cortisol output. results
support the utility of including both hair and diurnal salivary cortisol
measures in future research.
our hypothesis that proximal ses indicators would be more robustly
associated with early childhood cortisol than distal indicators was only
partially supported. household chaos and food insecurity, both
proximal indicators directly experienced by the child, were the only
ses variables to account for unique variance in diurnal salivary
cortisol function. however, while most of the ses indicators correlated
with child hcc, it was parental education that uniquely explained hcc
in both infants and 3.5-year-olds, with the children of less educated
parents demonstrating higher hcc. we had expected that income
and parent education, the most widely used indices of ses, were
proxies for specific ses-linked risk factors which were more important
to cortisol function. it is noteworthy that family income did not uniquely
explain any of the cortisol variables in either age group — that is,
income did not provide additional information about cortisol function
beyond the other ses indicators considered. this suggests that using
income as a single measure of ses is not the most sensitive
approach. however, as mentioned, parent education did uniquely

explain child hcc at both ages. this finding corroborates work by
ursache et al. (2017) and vaghri et al. (2013), both of whom reported
that parent education was inversely related to child hcc. parent
education is in some sense a summary measure of ses risk, as it is
associated with so many proximal risk factors. interestingly, hcc is
also a summary measure, reflecting the cumulative cortisol output
over several months. this includes not only basal cortisol levels
during the day but also cortisol exposure due to prolonged or repeated
stress responses. both these types of salivary measures are linked to
hcc (flom, st john, meyer, & tarullo, 2017; kao et al., 2018). hcc
also reflects nighttime cortisol output, which is rarely measured
directly in developmental studies, and therefore incorporates the
effects on cortisol levels of nighttime sleep disruptions. it is possible
that all these various aspects of cortisol function are influenced by
different combinations of proximal factors. the best indicator of child
hcc may be parent education, which stands in for these various
proximal factors. it does not necessarily follow that increasing parent

itis striking that neighborhood risk uniquely contributed to infant hcc
in the current study, distinct both from parent hcc and from the more
global ses indicator of parent education. unlike household chaos and
food insecurity, neighborhood risk is not a proximal risk factor, at least
for infants. the measure used in the current study assessed the
parent's perception of neighborhood risk with questions about
vandalism, drug activity, to what extent the parent felt safe in the
neighborhood, and to what extent the parent thought neighbors could
be counted on to help each other. these are all characteristics beyond
a 12-month-old's cognitive capacity to assess. rather, when the
parent perceives the neighborhood to be unsafe or unpredictable, the
infant has higher chronic biological stress, again above and beyond
the parent's own biological stress. this result parallels a study of
nonhuman primate macaques in which after a 4-month variable
foraging demand paradigm was administered to the mothers, infant
macaques showed elevated cerebrospinal fluid concentrations of

that signals the adrenal glands to produce corticosteroids (coplan et
al., 2005). thus, in infant macaques, as in the infant humans in the
current study, a parent's experience of uncertainty was associated
with elevated infant biological stress. while the mechanism cannot be
determined from the current data, one could speculate that the infant
is reacting to the parent's chronic anxiety or vigilance as a threat
signal, and therefore becoming chronically vigilant as well. if this is the
case, the parent's perception of threat may be critical to infant
cumulative cortisol exposure. it will be important for future studies to
attend not only to commonly calculated objective neighborhood
indicators, such as mean neighborhood income or percent
unemployment, but also to parental perception of neighborhood risk.

a role of food insecurity in hcc (ling et al., 2019) and of
neighborhood risk (finegood, wyman, o'connor, & blair, 2017;
roubinov et al., 2018) and household chaos (blair et al., 2013; chen
et al., 2009) in diurnal cortisol measures. these three ses risks have
in common an element of unpredictability — not knowing when or if
food will be available, an absence of household routines, and a
perception that the neighborhood is not secure or supportive.
uncertainty and perceived threat upregulate the amygdala, and limbic
signals in turn activate the hpa axis (gunnar, 2017). in adults and in
animal models, unpredictable and unsafe contexts are associated with
cortisol dysregulation. for example, a study of kenyan adults found
higher hcc in those who reported feeling unsafe when collecting
water or using sanitation facilities (henley et al., 2014). the stress of
unpredictability is well studied in the primate literature, in which
variable foraging demand paradigms are used to model the effects of

unpredictability is well studied in the primate literature, in which
variable foraging demand paradigms are used to model the effects of
resource scarcity and unpredictability (rosenblum & paully, 1984).
young children, even infants, experience the unpredictability of
household chaos quite directly, as a lack of household routines,
variable feeding and sleep schedules, and perhaps variable behavior
of family members, so it is not surprising that both infants and 3.5-
year-olds had higher bedtime scc levels in chaotic households, and
infants had higher cortisol output across the day. food insecurity was
specifically associated with flatter diurnal slope in 3.5-year-olds. a
flattening of diurnal slope is thought to reflect dysregulation of the
circadian rhythm of the hpa axis following extended up-regulation due
to chronic or repeated stressors (gunnar & vazquez, 2006). in the
case of food insecurity, unpredictability of food access is likely a
chronic stressor, and hunger, as a threat to homeostasis, could also
itself induce repeated hpa responses to restore homeostasis. thus, it
is fairly straightforward to posit mechanisms through which household
chaos and food insecurity could disrupt diurnal cortisol function.

parent cortisol function. however, for both infants and 3.5-year-olds,
while parent hcc was correlated with child cortisol function, ses

biological stress. this early emerging sensitivity to ses risks
highlights the need to understand the mechanisms through which ses
risks interact with the developing hpa axis, to inform effective
prevention and intervention approaches to buffer young children in
low-ses contexts from hyperactivity and dysregulation of the hpa
axis.

discussion

 

we examined socioeconomic correlates of hair and salivary cortisol
measures in 12-month-old infants and 3.5-year-old children and tested
parental sensitivity as a potential mediator of these associations. hcc
was a sensitive biomarker of multiple ses indicators, above and
beyond parent biological stress. for both age groups, parent
education was uniquely associated with child chronic biological stress,
indexed by child hcc, controlling for parent hcc. in addition,
neighborhood risk contributed to infant hcc. for diurnal salivary
cortisol, more proximal ses indicators were key to explaining
individual differences. household chaos uniquely accounted for
variance in bedtime scc in both age groups, and total diurnal cortisol
output in infants. flatter slope, indexing diurnal dysregulation, was
linked specifically to food insecurity in 3.5-year-olds. contrary to our
expectations, parental sensitivity did not mediate pathways from ses
risks to child cortisol. results demonstrate the specific role of
unpredictable and unsafe contexts in dysregulation of biological stress
in early childhood and show that diurnal and chronic cortisol indices

vary in their susceptibility to proximal and distal ses risks. these

to explore parenting as a potential pathway through which
socioeconomic risks may play a role in child cortisol function, we first
tested the association of parental sensitivity with infant and child
cortisol measures. in infants, parental sensitivity was unrelated to any
of the cortisol measures. in 3.5-year-olds, lower parental sensitivity
was linked to higher child hcc, r = -.27, p = .01, and to higher
bedtime scc, r = -.23, p = .04. to understand whether parental
sensitivity mediated links between socioeconomic risks and hcc in
3.5-year-old children, ordinary least squares path analysis (hayes,
2017) was conducted using the process 3.4.1 macro in spss (see
table 3 for model coefficients). education was the independent
variable, parental sensitivity was the potential mediator, parent hcc
was a covariate, and the dependent variable was child hcc. the
model was significant, f (3, 81) = 25.52, p< .001,r =.44, and there
was a significant pathway from parent education to parental
sensitivity. however, the model had no indirect effects, such that
parental sensitivity did not mediate the association of parent education
with child hcc. next, ordinary least squares path analysis was used

to understand whether parental sensitivity mediated links between

r = .17, but there was no indirect effect of parental sensitivity on

socioeconomic risk and child cortisol

correlations of the socioeconomic risks and parent hcc with child
hair and salivary cortisol measures are presented in table 2. parent
hcc, indexing parent chronic biological stress, was correlated with
most child cortisol measures and consequently was included as a
covariate in regression models. higher child hcc, indexing child
chronic biological stress, was correlated with lower parent education,
lower parent occupational prestige and greater food insecurity for both
12-month-old infants and 3.5-year-olds. in infants, higher hcc was
also related to lower itn and higher neighborhood risk. for the
infants, a stepwise linear regression was conducted to determine
unique socioeconomic contributors to infant hcc, controlling for

accounting for 33.4% of the variance in infant hcc and revealed that
in addition to parent hcc, b = .40, p < .001, both parent education,

b =-.25, p = .030, and neighborhood risk, b = .23, p = .045, uniquely
contributed to infant hcc. in 3.5-year-old children, stepwise linear
regression of child hcc on its socioeconomic correlates, f

(2,79) = 29.65, p < .001, accounted for 41.4% of the variance in child
hcc and found that parent education, b = -.32, p < .001, uniquely
contributed to child hcc above and beyond parent hcc, b = .50, p<

pearson correlations were conducted within each age group to test
the association of each dimension of ses (itn, parent education,
parent occupational prestige, household chaos, neighborhood risk,
food insecurity) with hair and salivary cortisol measures. linear
regressions were then conducted to determine which dimensions of
ses uniquely contributed to child hcc and salivary cortisol,
controlling for parent hcc. parent hcc is typically closely associated
with child cortisol function, so including parent hcc in the models
enabled us to examine unique ses effects on child cortisol above and
beyond parent cortisol. finally, to examine whether links between ses
and child cortisol could be explained by parenting, we tested parent
sensitivity as a mediator of associations between each of the unique
ses predictors and child cortisol variables. mediation analyses were

video records of parentxchild interactions were coded using the
sensitivity subscale from the emotional availability (ea) scales (pipp-
siegel & biringen, 1998). the sensitivity subscale captures the
parent's ability to read the child's cues and respond to them in a way
that is well accepted by the child. this includes clear, accurate
perceptions of emotions, responsiveness, ability to handle conflictual
situations and awareness of timing (biringen & easterbrooks, 2012).
higher scores indicate optimal sensitivity while lower scores reflect
emotional detachment. two doctoral students, certified coders who
completed the ea training program, coded the videos and 20% of the
sample was double coded for reliability. intraclass correlation
coefficients (icc) were calculated to assess interrater reliability. the
icc for parental sensitivity was .97 for the infant group and .81 for the

a shape-sorter toy designed for toddlers, challenging for 12-month-
olds, and parents were instructed to play only with the shape-sorter.
for the 3.5-year-olds, the experimenter brought in a challenging
wooden puzzle (hammond, miller, carpendale, bibok, & liebermann-
finestone, 2012) with the instruction to “work on the puzzle together.”
for both ages, all the free play toys were left in the room during the
structured play, making it more difficult for the parent to sustain the
child's attention on the difficult toy. parents were informed that when
they heard a knock on the door it was time to clean up, and they were
instructed to try their best to get their child to put the toys away ina

united states (coates, swindale, & bilinsky, 2007). the questionnaire
covers three domains of the experience of food insecurity: anxiety and
uncertainty about food supply, insufficient quality and variety of food,
and insufficient food intake and its consequences. eleven extreme
values (six infant and five 3.5-year-old) were winsorized to within three
standard deviations of the mean to meet the assumptions of normality.
neighborhood risk

parents completed the neighborhood organization and affiliation
scale-revised (noaa; knight, smith, martin, & lewis, 2008). the
neighborhood chaos subscale was used, which consists of 14 items in
which parents report on neighborhood problems such as vandalism
and drug activity, and whether they feel safe (cronbach's a = .92).
sample items include: “in my neighborhood, | always feel safe” and
“in my neighborhood, there is open drug activity.”
household chaos

household chaos was measured using the short version of the
confusion, hubbub, and order scale (chaos). it is a widely used
six-item scale that assesses the level of chaos in the home
environment (matheny, wachs, ludwig, & phillips, 1995). mothers
rated the extent to which they agreed with the six statements
reflecting chaotic or calm and organized household environment

(1 = definitely true and 5 = definitely untrue). examples of items from
this scale are, “it's a real zoo in our home” and “there is usually a

this scale are, “it's a real zoo in our home” and “there is usually a
television turned on somewhere in our home.”
occupational prestige

occupational prestige was coded for each parent using the job zone
coding scheme from the occupational information network (o*net,
http://www.onetonline.org/help/online/zones), which ranks us census-
based occupational categories on a 1-5 scale based on the
education, experience, and training required. codes were
standardized and averaged to create a combined parent occupational
prestige composite.

parents reported their annual household income and the number of
family members currently living in the household. to calculate itn, we
divided total family income by the federal poverty threshold based on
the number of household members. for example, an itn ratio of 3
indicates that household income is three times the federal poverty line
for that household size. three extreme values from 3.5-year-olds’
households were winsorized to within three standard deviations of the
mean to meet the assumptions of normality. our sample, by design,
represented a wide range of household income, with the bottom
quartile in both age groups qualifying for public assistance.
socioeconomic status (ses) multidimensional
assessment
motion data were recorded to quantify onset and offset of sleep on the
three nights preceding the collection of saliva sample. parents were
trained to attach the actigraph to the infant or child's right ankle at
bedtime. sleep offset times were calculated from actigraphy data in
matlab 9.2.0.556344 (mathworks inc., ma, usa) using the
algorithms and thresholds put forth by galland and colleagues to
measure sleep-wake states in infants with actigraphy (galland,
kennedy, mitchell, & taylor, 2012). the actigraphy-based data for
sleep offset times were validated by parent report home diaries to
ensure that the actigraphy-derived sleep offset occurred before the
parent report of child wake. time since waking when the morning
sample was taken was calculated using the mems trackcap

timestamp and the actigraphy-derived sleep offset data (infants:

parent report of child wake. time since waking when the morning
sample was taken was calculated using the mems trackcap
timestamp and the actigraphy-derived sleep offset data (infants:

m = 41.39 min, sd = 28.37; 3.5-year-olds: m = 45.96 min, sd = 25.84).
when participants were missing actigraphy data, information about
sleep offset was obtained from home diary parent reports. to control
for variability in the time of sampling relative to the cortisol awakening
response that peaks about 30 min after waking, the square of the time
since wake was regressed out of slope and aucg values, and the
residual values were used in analyses.
morning cortisol levels are closely linked to time since waking, due to
the car. however, parents may not always know or report accurately
the moment their child wakes up. therefore, children wore actigraphs
on their ankles on the nights prior to cortisol sampling, so that sleep
offset time (wake time) could be objectively measured.

averaged across all days of sampling and log transformed: scc;

cortisol values were used to calculate aucg from morning to bedtime
as an estimate of diurnal cortisol exposure over the day using the
trapezoid formula (pruessner, kirschbaum, meinlschmid, &
hellhammer, 2003). diurnal slope, indexing diurnal rhythm, was
computed using the rise-over-run formula: change across the day in
scc divided by the time elapsed from morning to bedtime sample.

diurnal salivary cortisol

we trained parents in home cortisol collection techniques during the
laboratory visit, and provided parents with a home kit including all
collection materials, instructions, and a home diary to record
information about time of sampling, bed and wake times, feeding and
napping, and other factors that can affect cortisol levels. sampling
times were verified using mems trackcaps, which record a
timestamp when the bottle that contains sampling supplies is opened.
parents were instructed to place a synthetic swab in the child's mouth
for a total of 60 seconds (salimetrics, state college, pa). for the 3.5-
year-old children, to enhance child compliance, stickers were included
in the kit and children were told they could earn sticker rewards for
getting the stick “super wet.” no oral stimulants were used. parents
were asked to collect saliva samples in the morning as close as
possible to waking, in the early afternoon, and just before bedtime
across three days when the parents spent most of their day with the
child. thus, the collection days were often nonconsecutive,
particularly for children who attended daycare, as sampling then
occurred on weekends. saliva samplings days were scheduled during

particularly for children who attended daycare, as sampling then
occurred on weekends. saliva samplings days were scheduled during
the lab visit and text reminders were sent the night before and
throughout the sampling day. the experimenter was available via text
to respond to parents’ questions at the time of saliva sample
collection. parents were instructed not to collect saliva samples if
infants were sick on the prescheduled saliva collection days. in such
cases, we rescheduled saliva collection to a week after the onset of
the sickness. parents collected saliva samples within 3 to 87 days

(m = 13, sd = 13.69) after the lab visit. collected samples were frozen
at -20° c until they were sent to trier laboratories in germany for
cortisol assay. at least two full days of sampling with biologically
plausible values was required to be included in analyses. in the infant
group, 10 infants had insufficient usable salivary cortisol and six more
only had sufficient data for some measures (for instance, some
children lacked afternoon samples, so aucg could not be calculated,
but bedtime cortisol could). in the 3.5-year-old group, six children had
insufficient usable salivary cortisol and eight more only had sufficient

 

children lacked afternoon samples, so aucg could not be calculated,
but bedtime cortisol could). in the 3.5-year-old group, six children had
insufficient usable salivary cortisol and eight more only had sufficient
data for some measures. thus, the infant sample size for salivary
cortisol measures range from 70 to 76, and the 3.5-year-old sample
size ranged from 73 to 81.
raw hcc levels for 12-month-old children with useable hcc data
(n = 84, m = 138.11, sd = 287.90) and their parents (n = 88,

m = 26.58, sd = 67.71) and for 3.5-year-old children (n = 86,

m = 35.27, sd = 80.63) and their parents (n = 87, m = 13.57,

sd = 24.40) were subjected to a natural log transformation because
the data were not normally distributed. infant hcc was higher than
3.5-year-old hcc, reflecting expected developmental changes in the
hpa axis and higher circulating cortisol in infancy, t (168) = 3.19,

p = .002. there were six infants without useable hcc samples: four
infants had biologically implausible hcc values (greater than 1500
pg/mg) and two did not provide a hair sample. two parents of infants
declined to provide hair samples. of the five 3.5-year-olds without
useable hcc, one sample was excluded due to biologically
implausible hcc value, one parent declined child hair cortisol

parents of 3.5-year-olds did not have useable hcc values: one parent

(parents of infants: spearman's rho = -.15, p = .172; parents of 3.5-
year-olds: spearman's rho = .05, p = .674), color treatment (parents of
infants: t(85) = -.83, p = .406; parents of 3.5-year-olds: t(84) = .24,

p = .814), or hair straightening (parents of infants: t(86) = - .647,

p = .519; parents of 3.5-year-olds: t(84) = -.20, p = .839). frequency
of washing was also unrelated to hcc in infants (spearman's

tho = .09, p = .438) and in 3.5-year-old children (spearman's

tho = .15, p = .171). therefore, it was not necessary to correct for

 

 

variation in hair care habits.
hair cortisol

hair cortisol measurement procedures followed validated methods
(davenport, tiefenbacher, lutz, novak, & meyer, 2006; meyer, novak,

the scalp, weighing ~15-30 mg were cut from the posterior vertex of
the head from the child and parent. samples were weighed
immediately so that additional strands of hair could be cut if needed to
meet the weight requirements. in a few cases of infants with little hair
or very fine hair, samples were assayed if they weighed at least 5 mg.
this sample indexed total cortisol output over the past several
months. because washing may affect hcc (hoffman, karban,
benitez, goodteacher, & laudenslager, 2014), parents were asked
about their child's hair history including the frequency that the hair got
wet. hair samples were stored in plastic tubes labeled with subject id,
and were frozen at -20° c until cortisol analysis. hair samples were
weighed, washed twice with isopropanol to remove contaminants,
dried, and ground into a fine powder. cortisol was extracted into
methanol, which was then evaporated, and the residue was
reconstituted in assay buffer. reconstituted extracts were analyzed for
cortisol using a sensitive and selective commercially available enzyme
immunoassay (salimetrics, llc; carlsbad, ca). assay readout was
converted to pg cortisol per mg of dry hair weight. both intra- and
inter-assay coefficients of variation were approximately 10%.

participants

one hundred and eighty-one children (90 children aged 12 months, 91
children aged 3.5 years) were enrolled in the study, but eight children
provided no usable hair or salivary cortisol values and were excluded
from analysis. this resulted in a final sample of 173 children, including
86 children aged 12 months (43 female, m = 12.24 months, sd=0.82)
and 87 children aged 3.5 years (44 female, m = 3.54 years, sd = 0.13
years). primary caregivers also participated (159 mothers, 14 fathers).
participants were from the greater boston metropolitan area and were
recruited from a department-maintained database of families who had
expressed interest in participating in research, from online advertising,
and from community recruitment events. all children were born full

chaos and food insecurity, and that parental sensitivity would mediate
these associations.
the goals of the current study were (a) to characterize the association
of multidimensional ses with diurnal and chronic indices of cortisol
function in early childhood and (b) to determine whether parental
sensitivity explained these associations. owing to rapid changes in
hpa function in early childhood, these associations may vary across
developmental time. therefore, we included two age groups in our
sample — 12-month-old infants and 3.5-year-old children. the sample
was socioeconomically diverse to capture variability in our ses
measures. the age of 12 months was selected because diurnal
salivary rhythms are typically well established by this age, and 3.5

was socioeconomically diverse to capture variability in our ses
measures. the age of 12 months was selected because diurnal
salivary rhythms are typically well established by this age, and 3.5
years was selected because of prior literature demonstrating the
sensitivity of the hpa axis to ses at this age. in a cross-sectional
design, we measured child diurnal salivary cortisol — yielding
measures of aucg, diurnal slope, and bedtime scc — and child hcc.
parents reported on both proximal and distal indicators of ses:
income, parental education, parental occupational prestige,
neighborhood risk, household chaos, and food insecurity. parental
sensitivity was coded from a parent-child interaction. because parent
and child biological stress are intertwined, we controlled for parent
hcc in our analyses, to examine specific associations of ses with
child cortisol measures above and beyond parents’ biological stress.
we anticipated that both acute and chronic cortisol function would be
most robustly related to proximal ses factors such as household
chaos and food insecurity, and that parental sensitivity would mediate
these associations.
parent and child cortisol function are related. parent hcc is
consistently associated with child hcc both in infancy (flom, st.
john, meyer, & tarullo, 2017; karlén, frostell, theodorsson, faresjé,
& ludvigsson, 2013) and in the preschool period (hollenbach et al.,
2019; kao, doan, st. john, meyer, & tarullo, 2018). parent hcc has
also been linked to child basal scc (tarullo, st. john, & meyer, 2017).
intergenerational transmission of biological stress likely reflects a

also been linked to child basal scc (tarullo, st. john, & meyer, 2017).
intergenerational transmission of biological stress likely reflects a
combination of genetic, prenatal, and shared environmental
mechanisms, as well as through parenting. twin studies demonstrate
the heritability of basal salivary cortisol (bartels, de geus,
kirschbaum, sluyter, & boomsma, 2003; ouellet-morin et al., 2009)
and of hcc (tucker-drob et al., 2017). similarity in cortisol levels may
also reflect that parent and child are exposed to shared environmental
stressors (stenius et al., 2008), such as crowding or family conflict.
finally, parents who are chronically biologically stressed may have
less optimal parent-child interactions. in one study, mothers with
higher hcc were more intrusive and less positively engaged in
interactions with their infants (tarullo et al., 2017). thus, associations
in parent and child cortisol may also occur through the indirect
pathway of parenting quality. interestingly, the degree of synchrony
between parent and child cortisol function appears to vary by ses.
low-ses mother-infant dyads had reduced synchrony of diurnal
cortisol output compared to high-ses mother-infant dyads (clearfield,

carter rodriquez. merali, & shober, 2014). in another study, the

low-ses mother-infant dyads had reduced synchrony of diurnal
cortisol output compared to high-ses mother-infant dyads (clearfield,
carter-rodriguez, merali, & shober, 2014). in another study, the
association of toddler cortisol reactivity with maternal basal scc was
moderated by ses (braren, perry, ursache, & blair, 2019). thus, in
examining the interplay of ses and child cortisol function, it is
important to measure and control for parent cortisol function in order
to describe specific associations of ses and child cortisol.
within low-income families, parenting is related to child cortisol
function, as indexed by both saliva and hair. in the family life project
cohort, lower positive caregiving behavior was uniquely associated
with higher basal scc in early childhood (blair, raver, granger, mills-
koonce, & hibel, 2011). a study of toddlers in low-income households
reported that they had higher basal scc if they were insecurely

nieebod mebesee bilinee receeaiele tens 2 cine coto) te fee

with higher basal scc in early childhood (blair, raver, granger, mills-
koonce, & hibel, 2011). a study of toddlers in low-income households
reported that they had higher basal scc if they were insecurely
attached (johnson, mliner, depasquale, troy, & gunnar, 2018). in two
recent studies of preschool children, lower parent sensitivity was
linked to higher child hcc (kao, tuladhar, meyer, & tarullo, 2019;
simmons et al., 2019). in another study of preschool children, parental
negativity mediated the association between poverty and flatter
diurnal slope (zalewski, lengua, kiff, & fisher, 2012). thus, chronic
exposure to multifaceted poverty-related stressors may interfere with
some parents’ ability to provide social buffering in early childhood.
parenting is a key mechanism through which ses risks may
contribute to dysregulated cortisol function. seminal work by megan
gunnar and colleagues has established that the hpa axis is under
strong social regulation in early childhood (gunnar & donzella, 2002;
gunnar, brodersen, nachmias, buss, & rigatuso, 1996). this work
has its roots in levine and colleagues’ work on early handling in rat
pups, which established that pups briefly separated from their mothers
had better regulated hpa axes in adulthood (levine, 1957).
importantly, these brief separations organized and enhanced the rat
mother's nurturing behavior upon the pup's return to the nest, and this
maternal behavior mediated effects of early handling on adult hpa
function (smotherman, brown, & levine, 1977). in humans, as in rats,
the hpa axis is immature at birth, such that infants and young children
cannot regulate cortisol function independently. rather, they depend
on the presence of sensitive, responsive caregivers to downregulate
their physiological stress and arousal, a phenomenon known as social
buffering (gunnar, 2017). social buffering does not refer to

on the presence of sensitive, responsive caregivers to downregulate

 

their physiological stress and arousal, a phenomenon known as social
buffering (gunnar, 2017). social buffering does not refer to
instrumental actions a caregiver could take to reduce an infant's
stress, such as warming up a cold infant or removing the infant from
the vicinity of a frightening noise. rather, the very presence of the
caregiver reduces the perception of threat and physiological response
to threat or hastens a return to baseline cortisol levels following a
stressor (gunnar, 2017). however, the quality of the parent-child
relationship plays a role in the parent's efficacy in buffering the child
from cortisol elevations (nachmias, gunnar, mangelsdorf, parritz, &
buss, 1996).

hair sampling is much easier than diurnal saliva sampling, especially
in developmental populations, as it places less burden on participants
and is not subject to the numerous methodological confounds that
plague diurnal salivary cortisol sampling, such as time since waking,
inaccuracies in sampling time, respiratory illness, acute stressors, and
dairy consumption, to name a few. however, most studies of hcc and
ses have not included salivary cortisol, so more research is needed
to better understand the interplay of hair and salivary measures with
respect to ses. it is also important to consider that there may be
developmental differences in the strength or nature of associations
between distinct aspects of ses and cortisol function. the hpa axis
matures significantly in the first few years of life, and susceptibility to
environmental risks may therefore change over developmental time.
further, with increasing cognitive and social development, children
interact with their surroundings differently and may become more alert
to certain ses-linked risks that may not have been as salient when
they were infants.
in contrast to salivary cortisol, which is an acute measure of cortisol
function time-locked to sampling time, hcc is a biomarker of chronic
stress, indexing cumulative cortisol output over several months. as
hair grows, circulating cortisol is deposited in the hair shaft (meyer &
novak, 2012), such that daytime and nighttime basal cortisol levels as
well as cortisol elevations in response to stressors all contribute to
hcc. increasing evidence indicates that children from low-ses
families have higher hcc (see for review, gray et al., 2018), which
could reflect chronic hyperactivity of the hpa axis as well as frequent
or prolonged cortisol responses to acute stressors. however, the
optimal index to detect ses effects on child hcc is unclear. two
studies of early elementary school aged children find that parent
education, but not income, is inversely associated with hcc (ursache

optimal index to detect ses effects on child hcc is unclear. two
studies of early elementary school aged children find that parent
education, but not income, is inversely associated with hcc (ursache
et al., 2017; vaghri et al., 2013). by contrast, for the large generation
r cohort in the netherlands, hcc in 6-year-olds was inversely
associated with income and independent of parent education (rippe
et al., 2016). finally, white et al. (2017) reported that both parent
education and income were inversely related to child hcc. parent
education and income are distal risk factors, and it is possible that
links between ses and hcc are due to unmeasured proximal factors
such as food insecurity or household chaos. these proximal factors
could co-vary with parent education and income to varying extents in
different samples, thereby leading to inconsistent results. thus, as
with salivary cortisol, moving the field forward in our understanding of
the relation of hcc and ses requires examination of a range of
proximal and distal ses indicators.
further complicating the picture, cortisol function is also
multidimensional. in the first year of life, the hpa axis establishes a
circadian rhythm, such that cortisol levels peak near waking in the
morning as the body prepares for the day (i.e., the cortisol awakening
response; car) and then drop across the day, reaching their nadir
early in nighttime sleep (born & fehm, 1998). salivary cortisol indexes
acute cortisol function. saliva samples collected throughout the day
and averaged across several days allow for calculation of the area
under the curve with respect to ground (aucg), indexing total daily
cortisol output. these same samples can also be used to calculate
diurnal slope, the change in cortisol levels from morning to bedtime,
which indexes cortisol regulation. salivary cortisol concentration
(scc) at specific points in the diurnal rhythm, such as bedtime, can
also be examined. in a threatening environment, the hpa axis
upregulates, leading to hyperactivity and higher cortisol output. in
infants, lower family income is associated with higher daily aucg
(saridjan et al., 2010). in a middle childhood sample, low ses also

x a

 

upregulates, leading to hyperactivity and higher cortisol output. in
infants, lower family income is associated with higher daily aucg
(saridjan et al., 2010). in a middle childhood sample, low ses also
predicts a greater increase in aucg across a 2-year period (chen et
al., 2009). however, in the face of prolonged stressors such as
poverty, the hpa axis may eventually become dysregulated and
hypoactive, as indicated by blunted morning scc and elevated
bedtime scc, and therefore a flattening of diurnal slope (gunnar &
vazquez, 2006). cortisol rhythms in low-ses adults demonstrate this
pattern of a blunted car and high bedtime scc (desantis et al.,
2015). using a combined ses index of income and parental
education, zhu et al. (2019) recently reported this same pattern of
blunted car and elevated bedtime scc in a large sample of children
aged 6-15 years. while there is evidence that these distinct indices of
salivary cortisol function - aucg, diurnal slope, car, and bedtime
scc — all reflect children's socioeconomic context based on income
or composite ses measures, they may vary in their sensitivity to
specific ses dimensions. a fuller understanding of how ses is

or composite ses measures, they may vary in their sensitivity to
specific ses dimensions. a fuller understanding of how ses is
incorporated into hpa function in early childhood requires
multidimensional assessment of both ses and cortisol function in the
same sample.
further complicating the picture, cortisol function is also

potential to elucidate underlying mechanisms.
to promote healthy child development and reduce long-term health
disparities, it is critical to foster healthy cortisol function in young
children growing up in low-ses households. unfortunately, the
frequently reported general association of low ses with cortisol
dysfunction is of limited utility toward this objective. many existing
studies have used a single distal measure of ses, most often income
or parent education, or assessed several dimensions of ses but then
combined them into a composite ses risk index. these simplified
measures of ses relate powerfully to child outcomes but obscure
underlying mechanisms. children who are in low-ses households are
exposed to a multitude of associated risks at the family and
neighborhood levels, such as crowding, noise, food insecurity, toxins,
and community violence (evans & english, 2002). thus, income and

foe on jotad sick faatare onc
exposed t to a multitude of associated risks at the family and

neighborhood levels, such as crowding, noise, food insecurity, toxins,
and community violence (evans & english, 2002). thus, income and
parent education are proxies for many correlated risk factors, and
some of these factors may be particularly important to child cortisol
function. for example, several salivary cortisol studies have identified
a specific role for household chaos in the context of low income (blair
et al., 2013; doom et al., 2018) or have found that household chaos
contributes to salivary cortisol levels above and beyond income (chen
et al., 2009). a recent small study reported initial evidence that food
insecurity was linked to higher hair cortisol concentration (hcc), an
index of chronic stress, in young children and their mothers (ling,
robbins, & xu, 2019). various ses factors may play a role in cortisol
function through distinct mechanisms. parental education may have
more indirect effects, whereas household chaos is a proximal factor in

mechanism through which an ses factor matters for cortisol function
may vary by developmental stage. for instance, several recent
studies suggest that within low-income samples, neighborhood risk
plays a key role in salivary cortisol levels in toddlers (finegood,
rarick, blair, & the family life project investigators, 2017), preschool
children (roubinov, hagan, boyce, adler, & bush, 2018), and
adolescents (brenner, zimmerman, bauermeister, & caldwell, 2013).
adolescents are likely to directly experience the neighborhood on their
own, and so for them, neighborhood risk may be a proximal factor
reflecting their adverse experiences or perception of threat. toddlers,
by contrast, are presumably less aware of neighborhood context, and
so for them the effects are likely indirect. a multidimensional
assessment of ses, with separate examination of specific ses risks
and attention to developmental stage, is needed to develop a nuanced
understanding of how ses relates to cortisol. this approach,
congruent with a developmental psychopathology perspective, has the
potential to elucidate underlying mechanisms.

ecobiodevelopmental frameworks (shonkoff, 2010; shonkoff &
garner, 2012) contend that early life environmental stressors, such as
poverty, leave an enduring imprint on the child at a biological level,
including on the hpa axis, through processes of physiological
adaptation or disruption. thus, a child who experiences chronic
hyperactivation of the hpa axis due to the stressor of early poverty is
likely to be more vulnerable to biological stress throughout life, and
consequently ill equipped to cope with environmental stressors
encountered in adulthood. cortisol dysregulation is posited to be a key
pathway through which early life environmental stressors such as
poverty result in adult health disparities (karlén et al., 2015;
vliegenthart et al., 2016). over time, cortisol dysregulation can lead to
dysregulation of other physiological systems due to the wear and tear
on the body of continually needing to restore homeostasis, a
phenomenon known as allostatic load (mcewen & stellar, 1993). here
again, early exposure to poverty may be particularly damaging. one
study reported that the proportion of time spent in poverty from birth
through age 9 years predicted allostatic load in adolescence (evans &
kim, 2012). allostatic load predicts adult morbidity and mortality

well established across a broad age range, from infancy (saridjan et
al., 2010) through middle childhood and adolescence (chen, cohen,
& miller, 2009; white et al., 2017). the hpa axis is maturing over the
first few years of life, such that early experiences are particularly
formative for later cortisol function (gunnar & talge, 2008). effects of
poverty on cortisol function tend to be most pronounced in individuals
who experience poverty in infancy and who have the greatest
cumulative exposure to poverty (blair et al., 2013; desantis et al.,
2015).

abstract

the hypothalamic-pituitary—adrenal (hpa) axis is sensitive to early life
stress, with enduring consequences for biological stress vulnerability
and health (gunnar & talge, 2008). low socioeconomic status (ses)
is associated with dysregulation of the stress hormone cortisol in early
childhood. however, a mechanistic understanding of this association
is lacking. multidimensional assessment of both ses and cortisol is
needed to characterize the intricate relations between ses and
cortisol function in early childhood. we assessed parent-reported

 

is lacking. multidimensional assessment of both ses and cortisol is
needed to characterize the intricate relations between ses and
cortisol function in early childhood. we assessed parent-reported
family income, parent education, occupational prestige, neighborhood
tisk, food insecurity, and household chaos for 12-month-old infants (n
= 90) and 3.5-year-old children (n = 91). hair cortisol concentration
(hcc) was obtained from parent and child, indexing chronic biological
stress, and diurnal salivary cortisol was measured in the children.
controlling for parent hcc, parent education uniquely predicted infant
and child hcc and, in addition, neighborhood risk uniquely predicted
infant hcc. household chaos predicted bedtime salivary cortisol
concentration (scc) for both infants and children, and infant daily
cortisol output. food insecurity was associated with flattened cortisol
slope in 3.5-year-old children. parental sensitivity did not mediate
relations between ses and cortisol. results highlight the utility of ses
measures that index unpredictable and unsafe contexts, such as
neighborhood risk, food insecurity, and household chaos.
