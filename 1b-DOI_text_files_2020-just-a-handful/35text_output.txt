background

imalian sperm are not able to fertilize an oocyte immediately after ejacule
quire fertilization competence, they must undergo a series of cellular changes

ctively known as capacitation (stival et al,, 2016). this process takes place within the
ile reproductive tract but can be emulated in the laboratory by incubating spermatozoa
