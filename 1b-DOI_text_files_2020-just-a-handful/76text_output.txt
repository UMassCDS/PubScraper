abstract

the capability of a solvent-mediated liquid-liquid extraction
(lle) method to improve the detection of ochratoxin a (ota)
in food matrixes using surface-enhanced raman
spectroscopy (sers) is described. sers detection of
mycotoxins with nanoparticle aggregation is a simple method
but with low reproducibility due to the heterogeneous
istribution of the nanoparticle aggregates. we evaluated
three different lle protocols to analyze their performance in
combination with sers. a facile extraction method based on.
sample acidification and addition of chloroform as a
separation solvent showed to not only extract ota from wine
and wheat but also facilitate the uniform distribution of the
nanoparticles leading to an improvement of the detection
signals and the reproducibility. this method enables rapid
and simple analysis of mycotoxin ochratoxin a in food
systems.

highlights

sers can be used as simple detection technique
for ochratoxin a.

chloroform as an extraction solvent enhances
silver nanoparticle distribution.

sers signal enhancement was observed when a
food matrix was involved.
