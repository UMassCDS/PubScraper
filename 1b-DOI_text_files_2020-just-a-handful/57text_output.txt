5. conclusions

this analysis of contemporary, nationally representative
nhanes data has shown that adoption of the acc/aha 2017
guidelines will result in an increase in the prevalence of htn
from a third to one half, compared with the jnc7 guidelines.
discrepancies exist between guidelines in the proportion of
htn and those with chtn after starting antihypertensive
treatment. the greatest discrepancies were in the middle-
aged population (40-59 years old). greater clarity is needed
about which guidelines should be used to guide health policy
in countries around the world.
4. discussion

 

to our knowledge, one of the first studies comparing
the prevalence of htn and chtn using jnc7 and acc/aha
2017 guidelines applied to nhanes 2017-2018 data. we have
found that a third (31.7%) of the us population have htn
based on the older jnc7 guidelines. when the stricter 2017
acc/aha cut-offs were applied, this increases to almost half
of the population (45.6%). of the people who had htn
according to the jnc7, almost half (48.2%) had chtn after
commencing antihypertensive medication. among those with
htn, according to acc/aha 2017 guidelines, only a fifth
21.0%) had chtn levels afte

htn, according to acc/aha 2017 guidelines, only a fifth
(21.0%) had chtn levels after starting treatment. when blood
pressure was assessed using both guidelines, the greatest
absolute increase in rates of htn and chtn between jnc7
and acc/aha 2017 guidelines was 17.4% and 30.0% in 40-59
years old, respectively. these analyses demonstrate a higher
prevalence of htn and a lower level of chtn when acc/aha
2017 guidelines are used. these findings have policy and
funding implications for the management of htn in the us.

  
 
 

 

 

using nhanes 2017-2018 data, we have found a high rate of
htn in the us population, irrespective of which guideline is
used. either a third (31.7%) or almost half (45.6%) of the us
population have htn based on the jnc7 or acc/aha 2017
guidelines, respectively. this is comparable to a us study
which applied acc/aha 2017 guidelines to nhanes 2015-
2016 data and found a prevalence of htn of 45.4% [10]. our
results also confirm that there have been modest increases in
htn prevalence in the last decade overall and across
categories of bmi and sex. for example, guo etal., 2012,

categories of bmi and sex. for example, guo etal., 2012,
reported an overall age-adjusted prevalence of 29.5%, using
the jnc7 cut-offs applied to nhanes 2009-2010 data [11].
we have found a comparable prevalence of 31.7% applying
jnc7 to nhanes 2017-2018 data. similarly, the prevalence of
htn was 30.5% in men and 28.5% in women (jnc7, nhanes
2009-2010) compared with our data: htn prevalence 33.1%
in men and 30.3% in women (jnc7, nhanes 2017 2018). the
prevalence of htn in those with bmi=30kg/m? was 40.5%
using jnc7 and nhanes 2007-2010 data [12] and 40.4% in
our analysis (jnc7, nhanes 2017-2018). however, the
increases over the decade were more substantial for diabetes.
for example, gillespie and hurvitz found a prevalence of htn
in those with diabetes of 59.4% (jnc7 nhanes 2007-2010)
[12]. we have found that a decade later, the prevalence of
htn in those with diabetes to be 67.6% (jnc7, nhanes 2017-
2018). why the prevalence of htn has increased substantially
in those with diabetes is not immediately clear. this may be
because of interactive effects in which diabetes and htn

in those with diabetes is not immediately clear. this may be
because of interactive effects in which diabetes and htn
exacerbate each other [13]. it may reflect secular increases in
risk factors for both htn and diabetes, such as the aging
population [14], [15], [16], [17]]. it is known that the
presence of htn in those with diabetes increases the risk of
coronary heart disease, stroke, nephropathy, and retinopathy
considerably [18]. these findings underscore the need for
early intervention to reduce the prevalence of htn,
particularly in those with comorbid diabetes who are already
at increased risk of coronary heart disease morbidity and
mortality [4].

our analysis has found discrepancies between htn
prevalence rates when the two guidelines are used. the
greatest discrepancy between the two guidelines was in the
40-59 years old age group. when jnc7 cut-offs were applied,
a prevalence of htn of 33.8% was found, whereas when
acc/aha guidelines were used, the corresponding prevalence
of htn rose to 51.2% (absolute increase:17.4%). this is higher

tl dis fe id in thi raducti is.
ru area soieernss wer used the" comespondiig prevalence

of htn rose to 51.2% (absolute increase:17.4%). this is higher
than the discrepancy found in the reproductive-aged us
women, where the absolute increase in rates of htn between
jnc7 and acc/aha 2017 was 8.7% [2]. the implication of our
finding is that if the jnc7 guidelines were used, 17.4 people
out of 100 aged 40-49 years would be classified as
prehypertensive and, therefore, not receive treatment. given
the high burden of disease due to complications arising from
untreated htn, as well as the higher costs of untreated
disease, these have very important public health
implications.

 

 

these discrepancies between guidelines were even greater
when the proportion of the population with chtn was
compared. according to acc/aha 2017 guideline, the
prevalence of chtn in 40-59 years old was 17.0%. the
corresponding prevalence based on jnc7 was 47.0% (absolute
ifference between the two guidelines was 30.0%). similar
large discrepancies in rates of chtn between guidelines was
found for those with obesity (absolute difference: 29.9%), in

 

 

large discrepancies in rates of chtn between guidelines was
found for those with obesity (absolute difference: 29.9%), in
males (29.1%), and those with diabetes (27.9%).

in addition, the prevalence of cthn in those with htn was
higher a decade ago than currently (cthn of 59.9%) in men
and 69.4% in women (jnc7, nhanes 2009-2010) compared
with chtn 47.6% in men and 48.8% in women (jcn7, nhanes
2017-2018) [11]. taken together, these data indicate that 1)
the use of acc/aha 2017 guidelines will result in far fewer
patients having chtn and that 2) hypertension control is
declining over time. this highlights the need to redouble
efforts for htn screening, detection, and treatment in order
to improve htn control.

our analysis confirms a very high prevalence of htn among
those with comorbidities, irrespective of the measure used.
for example, the prevalence of htn in people with diabetes
was 80.4% based on acc/aha 2017 and 67.6% using jnc7
guidelines. this is comparable to other us studies in which
busy abe ase dates bh ace muo wiest eae ney et
guidelines. this is comparable to other us studies in which
prevalence rates of ~70% in those with diabetes were found
using jnc7 guidelines [2,3,19]. this cohort of patients are
likely to benefit substantially from early drug treatment. for
example, a systematic review and meta-analysis of blood
pressure lowering in patients with type 2 diabetes found that
bp lowering was associated with improved mortality and
other clinical outcomes [20]. the greatest benefit was found
in those with higher blood pressure at baseline.

 

 

our results are consistent with studies conducted in both
high-income and low-middle-income countries that have
applied the two guidelines. for example, a canadian study
examined the prevalence of htn using the acc/aha 2017
guidelines and found that adoption of the acc/aha 2017 htn
guidelines would result in a near doubling in the prevalence
of htn in canada [21]. studies in the us, as well as in
developing countries like bangladesh and nepal, found the
acc/aha 2017 htn guideline detected more people as
hyperter jnc7 guideline

   

acc/aha 2017 htn guideline detected more people as
hypertensive when compared with the jnc7 guideline
[2,22,23]. this indicates that the use of the acc/aha 2017
guidelines will have similar effects, that of increasing the
prevalence of htn globally.

4.1. strengths and limitations

the strengths of the study are that it used a large, nationally
representative dataset indicating the findings have external
validity. high-quality sampling also minimized sampling bias.
clinical variables were measured in mobile clinics by trained
staff (e.g,, blood pressure, weight, and height). blood pressure
measurements were made carefully using best practice
techniques, including measurement of arm circumference to
determine cuff size and the determination of maximum
inflation level. the bp used in analyses was an average of
three measures. a weighted analysis to adjust for the
clustered sampling design of the nhanes survey was used to
estimate the prevalence of htn, which increased the
efasisied siping design of the naanes survey was tsed to
estimate the prevalence of htn, which increased the
precision of the findings. a limitation was that diabetes
mellitus was self-reported. also, we developed a secondary
analysis from a publicly available survey, which limited the
control of the variables, and stratifying for socioeconomic
status was not undertaken in this analysis.

 

 

4.2. public health relevance and implications

htn has a high burden of disease globally but is entirely
preventable. its surveillance and control must be a priority
for health systems around the world. furthermore, new
guidelines are important to continue with the screening and
early detection of at-risk patients, such as those defined like
pre-hypertension, to prevent complications across different
populations. the application of stricter guidelines will result
in a higher prevalence of those requiring treatment but may
result in long term cost savings by reducing complications
arising from untreated htn. when guidelines with stricter
cut-offs have been modelled previously, there have been

arising from untreated htn. when guidelines with stricter
cut-offs have been modelled previously, there have been
declines in the number of annual cardiovascular events and
deaths while saving costs [24]. guidelines with greater
relevance to other groups, such as ethnic minorities, are also
needed.

which was conducted by the national center for health
stati
prevention. to ensure national representativeness, the study
samples are identified through a complex, stratified,
multistage probability sampling design. it consists of a four-
stage sample: counties, segments, households, and
individuals. survey participants completed in-home
interviews and then visited a mobile examination center,
where they responded to additional questionnaires and
underwent a medical examination and blood sample
collection. nhanes maintains high standards to ensure
minimal non-sampling and measurement errors during

final analyses. participants completed standardized
questionnaires that assessed demographics; prior diagnosis
of htn and antihypertensive medication use; prior diagnosis
of high blood cholesterol; and the use of lipid-lowering
drugs; and diabetes mellitus. body mass index was calculated
as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared.
diabetes mellitus was self-reported, defined by a positive
response to any of the questions, “have you ever been told by
a doctor that you have diabetes?”; “are you now taking
insulin?”; “are you now taking diabetes pills to lower your
blood sugar?” the study was approved by the national center
for health statistics research ethics review board, and all
adult participants provided written informed consent [8].

include the fourth measurement because of the large number
of missing values. all bp measurements were taken in the
mobile examination center using the right arm unless
specific conditions prohibit the use of the right arm. prior to
bp measurements, upper arm circumference is measured,
which is done to guide the selection of cuff size.

1. introduction

the american college of cardiology/american heart
association (acc/aha) have developed evidence-based
guidelines for the prevention and first line management of
hypertension (htn) in the us [1]. they were developed by
experts and translate the best available evidence into
guidelines for clinical practice. although they are written for
aus population, they have global impact. despite this, htn
remains a significant contributor to the global burden of
isease, and it remains an important risk factor for
cardiovascular morbidity and mortality [[2], [3], [4]]. htn has
previously been defined by the seventh report of the joint
national committee on prevention, detection, evaluation,
and treatment of high blood pressure (jnc7) as individuals
who have a systolic bp> 140mmhg or a diastolic
bp>90mmhg or take any prescribed drugs to control bp [5].
aar ree oes he ue dasa he stoic
bp>90mmhg or take any prescribed drugs to control bp [5].
however, the acc/aha 2017 guidelines lowered the systolic
and diastolic blood pressure thresholds for htn [1].
according to the acc/aha 2017 guidelines, individuals who
have a systolic bp> 130mmhg or a diastolic bp=80mmhg or
take any prescribed drugs to control bp were categorized as
hypertensive. application of the acc/aha 2017 guidelines
would reclassify many individuals who had normal blood
pressure (or were prehypertensive) using jnc7 criteria, as
hypertensive. while this classification of people as
hypertensive at lower levels of blood pressure would allow
earlier intervention in the natural history of the disease, it
also has implications for the evaluation of the outcomes of
current prevention and control methods.

 

 

 

 

 

previous studies that have investigated the impact of the new
acc/aha 2017 guidelines have found marked increases in
prevalence rates. for example, when blood pressure was
assessed using both jnc7 and acc/aha 2017 guidelines
among reproductive-aged us women, the prevalence of htn

assessed using both jnc7 and acc/aha 2017 guidelines
among reproductive-aged us women, the prevalence of htn
increased by 112% [2]. this has significant implications for
blood pressure management in the us. the impact of the new
guidelines has also been examined in other populations in
the us [6,7]. in these studies, an absolute increase in
prevalence varied from 14.7% to 26.8% in the us when
acc/aha 2017 guidelines were applied [6]. repeating this
analysis using more recent data will provide up to date
evidence for planning future health policy interventions for
the management of htn.

in this study, we aim to use the most recent cycle of nhanes
2017-2018 data to compare the prevalence of htn and
controlled hypertension (chtn) in us adults and determine
the absolute difference in the prevalence of htn and chtn
between the jnc7 and acc/aha 2017 guidelines.

of the national health and nutrition examination survey
(nhanes) 2017-2018. after excluding participants with
missing systolic blood pressure (bp) or diastolic bp and aged
<18 years, 4730 participants were included in the final
analyses. bp was defined as the average of the first three
measurements. the prevalence of htn and chtn, including
absolute differences of these prevalences, were estimated
using both jnc7 and acc/aha 2017 guidelines.

results

the overall weighted prevalence of htn was 31.7% (95% cl:
28.7-34.8) based on jnc7, while the corresponding
prevalence was 45.6% (95% ci: 43.0-48.3) when new
guideline of acc/aha was used. of the people who had htn
according to the jnc7 and acc/aha 2017 guidelines, 48.2%
(95% cl: 44.4-52.0) and 21.0% (95% ci: 18.1-24.2) had a
controlled blood pressure level, respectively. when blood
pressure was assessed using both guidelines, the greatest
absolute increase in rates of htn and chtn was 17.4% and

pressure was assessed using both guidelines, the greatest
absolute increase in rates of htn and chtn was 17.4% and
30.0% in people aged 40-59 years, respectively.

conclusion

given the high burden of disease due to complications arising
from untreated htn, as well as the higher costs of untreated
isease, new guidelines have important public health
implications to early detection of patients at risk and prevent
complications across different populations.
