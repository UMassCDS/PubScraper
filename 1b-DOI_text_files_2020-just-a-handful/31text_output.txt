6. summary and future directions

age-related problems with speech understanding that begin
in middle age cannot be explained entirely by the amount of
audiometric hearing loss that individuals experience.
underlying changes in cognitive and higher-level auditory
processing likely contribute to these challenges. moreover,
middle-aged individuals may need to expend more effort to
reach the same level of performance as younger individuals,
which also likely helps to explain why middle-aged people
report that understanding speech in adverse acoustic
environments is difficult. seeing the face of a speaker can
provide valuable information to at least partially mitigate
some of these challenges, yet it remains unclear whether
access to audiovisual speech reduces or increases listening
effort in middle-aged adults (for other age groups, see e.g.
(gosselinand gagné, 2011; mishraetal., 2013; sommersand
phelps, 2016).

(gosselinand gagné, 2011; mishraetal., 2013; sommersand
phelps,2016).

the types of listening situations that appear to be most
problematic and/or effortful for middle-aged adults
(understanding speech when there are intelligible competing
messages) typically are not evaluated during routine clinical
assessment. current clinical protocols also do not assess how
individuals use visual speech cues and so are not accurate
indicators of how people function in face-to-face
communication situations. clinically, this points to the perils
of over-relying on objective test results and confirms the
importance of making sure that we get a clear picture of how
middle-aged individuals perceive they function in the outside
world.

how should the hearing challenges of middle-aged adults be
remediated? the importance of not ignoring these problems
is bolstered by the frequently-cited conclusion by
livingstonetal. (2017)) that hearing loss in midlife is a
modifiable risk factor for dementia. currently, the primary

is bolstered by the frequently-cited conclusion by
livingstonetal. (2017)) that hearing loss in midlife is a
modifiable risk factor for dementia. currently, the primary
way to treat hearing loss is through hearing aids. hearing aids
can help reduce listening effort (e.g., johnsonetal., 2016;
picouand ricketts,2017; rovettietal., 2019; shehornetal.,
2017) and emerging data suggests that treating hearing loss
may lead to a reduction in cognitive decline (amievaetal.,
2015; dealetal., 2015; maharanietal., 2018; sarantetal.,
2020). more research needs to be conducted to determine if
these findings hold up under the gold-standard of
longitudinal placebo-controlled clinical trials. if that is the
case, it would confirm the importance of urging middle-aged
adults with hearing loss to seek treatment.

overall, there is a paucity of research that focuses specifically
on speech understanding in middle-age. we challenge
researchers to devote more attention to middle-aged adults,
not only to address clinical questions but also to further

9. cognition and nearing in miaale age

a portion of the inconsistency between objectively-measured
hearing loss and middle-aged adults’ subjective problems
understanding speech could be related to changes in
cognition associated with aging. the situations that are most
problematic for middle-aged adults tend to entail listening to
one talker embedded in a background of other intelligible
speech messages. these environments likely require more
cognitive mediation than when the competition is less
complex noise. indeed, complaints about cognitive changes
(especially short-term memory and concentration) are
common among middle-aged adults (e.g., begum etal., 2014;
vercammen et al., 2017), and it is feasible that changes in
these functions that occur early in the aging process can
influence individuals’ ability to cope in complex listening
situations. it should be noted, however, that there is
abundant inter-subject variability when memory and
executive functioning are assessed in middle-aged adults
(eg., gunstadetal., 2006).

one question that has been addressed in a number of studies

(eg. gunstadetal., 2006).

one question that has been addressed in a number of studies
is the extent to which hearing loss in middle-aged adults
mediates these cognitive changes. recent evidence is mixed,
with some work suggesting that only weak links exist
between hearing and cognition when measured in adults
who are middle-aged (merten etal., 2020; schubertetal.,
2019), especially once other variables such as age, education,
and depression are controlled (bucksetal., 2016). however, a
recent analysis of a large sample of individuals (n=6451, 50-
76 years of age, mean 59 years) concluded that the presence
of even slightly elevated hearing thresholds (less than what
would be considered clinical hearing impairment) was
associated with poorer performance for a range of cognitive
measures including psychomotor speed, attention, verbal
fluency, verbal memory, and global cognitive function. this
relationship persisted even after accounting for potential
confounding variables such as age, educational level, and the
presence of cardiovascular risk factors (golubetal., 2019).

4. listening effort in middle-aged adults

even if middle-aged adults can understand speech
adequately in challenging listening situations, they may need
to expend more effort to do so. one framework for examining
how effort relates to speech understanding is the ease of
language understanding (elu) model (rénnbergetal., 2013;
rénnberg,2003). the elu model has been used to account for
the influence of cognition (particularly working memory) on
speech understanding. according to the elu, speech
perception is rapid and automatic under ideal circumstances,
necessitating few cognitive resources. when there is a
mismatch between the stored representation of speech and
auditory input (due to hearing loss or the masking effects of
noise), speech understanding is more effortful and requires
explicit use of cognitive resources, especially working
memory (rénnberg,2003; rénnbergetal., 2019; stenfeldand
rénnberg,2009). the elu (like many other models of
working memory) posits that there is a limited capacity
system; when more cognitive capacity is required for
rénnberg,2009). the elu (like many other models of
working memory) posits that there is a limited capacity
system; when more cognitive capacity is required for
listening, less remains for encoding information into memory
or performing another task at the same time.

 

also relevant is the fuel (framework for understanding
effortful listening; pichora-fulleretal., 2016) model, which
takes into account the importance of motivation and rewards
when considering listening effort. individuals likely differ not
only in how much effort is required for them to successfully
complete a task, but also in the amount of effort they are
willing to expend on a task, depending on the cost-benefit
ratio (eckertetal., 2016; matthen, 2016; richter,2016). if a
conversation is inordinately difficult to follow, a listener may
not be willing to devote sufficient effort to understand what
is being said, particularly if he/she perceives that the cost of
investing the necessary effort is not worth the potential
benefit that would be derived from participating in that
conversation. hence, effort has been characterized by an
inverted u-shaped curve, with maximum effort expended in
denetit'that would bé derived trom participating in that
conversation. hence, effort has been characterized by an
inverted u-shaped curve, with maximum effort expended in
the mid-range of performance (e.g., wendtetal., 2018;
wuetal., 2016).

effort or cognitive load can be estimated as an increase in
dual-task costs: the extent to which performance on a task
completed in isolation is negatively affected when individuals
execute another task simultaneously (e.g., broadbent, 1958).
for example, participants may be asked to complete a speech
understanding test (the primary task) while also pressing a
button in response to another stimulus (the secondary task),
and are instructed to optimize their performance of the
primary task. listening effort is quantified by the difference
in performance on the secondary task (e.g., increased button-
press reaction time) when completing both tasks together as
compared to when just completing the secondary task. a
decline in performance on the secondary task during dual-
task conditions is taken to indicate an increase in effort
needed to maintain performance on the primary task. these
dual-task.gnsts.are.assumed sn he caused bw camnetitinn for
task conditions is taken to indicate an increase in effort
needed to maintain performance on the primary task. these
dual-task costs are assumed to be caused by competition for
resources: when the primary task is more difficult or
effortful, fewer resources remain for performing the
secondary task (e.g., kahneman, 1973). results of research
using dual-task paradigms support the idea that
understanding speech in noise is more effortful for older than
for younger adults (e.g., desjardins and dougherty, 2013;
gosselinand gagné, 2011); tun, mccoy, and wingfield, 2009).
this increase in listening effort with aging, as estimated from
dual-task costs, begins in middle age (cramerand
donai,2019; degeestetal., 2015; xiaetal., 2015). for example,
degeestetal. (2015) measured the impact of performing a
visual memory task (the secondary task) on recognizing five-
digit utterances in the presence of steady-state noise (the
primary task) in adults 20-77 years. listening effort, as
estimated by dual-task costs, began to increase between 40
and 45 years of age.

 

and 45 years of age.

one of our labs has recently focused on using more realistic
dual-task studies to index listening effort in younger and
middle-aged adults. the first of these investigations
(helferetal., 2020) used a balancing-while-listening task. in
this study, participants performed a speech understanding
task with sentences presented in steady-state noise or in a
two-talker competing speech background at two different
signal-to-noise ratios (snrs). during this study, participants
were instructed to stand as still as possible while either in
normal stance, with their feet approximately shoulder-width
apart (the easy postural condition) or in tandem stance, with
one foot behind the other (the harder postural condition).
results were consistent with the idea that participants were
able to maintain their level of performance on the speech
perception task during dual-task conditions, but at a cost to
postural control. although performance on both the speech
perception task and the balance task were similar between
groups when each task was administered in isolation, dual-
task costs for postural control were larger in middle-aged (vs.
perception task and the balance task were similar between
groups when each task was administered in isolation, dual-
task costs for postural control were larger in middle-aged (vs.
younger) adults, especially when the masker was competing
speech. moreover, postural control was poorer for both
groups of participants when the speech perception task was
conducted at the more adverse snr, vs. when the snr was
more advantageous. speech perception did not differ
significantly between single- and dual-task conditions.
overall, the results suggested that understanding sentences
in the presence of competing speech was especially effortful
for our middle-aged participants, as demonstrated by the
magnitude of dual-task costs.

as discussed earlier, analysis of self-report data that include
questions about how well people believe they perform
different listening situations shows that middle-aged people
tend to rate their functional hearing ability as poorer than
what would be expected based on their pure-tone thresholds
(kamiletal., 2014); bainbridge and wallhagen, 2015). another
dimension that can be examined with self-report data is how
wnat would be expected based on their pure-tone thresnolds
(kamiletal., 2014); bainbridge and wallhagen, 2015). another
dimension that can be examined with self-report data is how
much effort people report they need to expend in adverse
listening situations. two of the questions on the abbreviated
version of the $sq that is used in one of our labs can give
insight into the cognitive load or effort that individuals feel
they expend when listening in the real world: “do you have to
put in a lot of effort to hear what is being said in conversations
with others?” and “do you have to concentrate very much when
listening to someone or something?”. we have collected
responses to these questions in nine studies that included
middle-aged and/or older adults (n=69 participants > 65
years of age and 169 participants 40-64 years of age).
although, as anticipated, high-frequency pure-tone
thresholds were significantly higher for the older group
(f1,282=30.24, p <.001), responses to these two ssq
questions were essentially equivalent across age groups.
anova on these data showed that the difference between
groups was not statistically significant for either question
(effort question: f(1, 236)=3.18, p=.076); concentration
anova on these data showed that fhe ditférence betwéen
groups was not statistically significant for either question
(effort question: f(1, 236)=3.18, p=.076); concentration
question: f{1,236)=2.4, p=.120). in fact, self-assessed effort
and concentration changed little between ages 45 and 75
years (fig.2). consistent with the overall ssq results reported
earlier in this paper, middle-aged participants in our studies
perceived that they expended about as much effort while
listening as our older participants who had considerably
more hearing loss, and that they needed to concentrate as
much as did the older adults.

 

 
4. listening effort in middle-aged adults
the ability to extract and process information from visual
speech seems to gradually decline across the adult lifespan
(eg., sommersetal., 2005; tye-murrayetal., 2016). these age-
related changes in speechreading become more apparent in
difficult processing situations, such as for the speechreading
of sentences rather than of simpler consonant-vowel
syllables (shoopand binnie, 1979; waldenetal., 1993),
especially when the latter only consists of a very small set
(sekivamaetal_. 2014). this reduction in the ability to
syllables (shoopand binnie, 1979; waldenetal., 1993),
especially when the latter only consists of a very small set
(sekiyamaetal., 2014). this reduction in the ability to
speechread seems to have an early onset, apparent already at
mid-life (shoopand binnie, 1979; tye-murrayetal., 2016).
gender differences in speechreading found in young adults
can persist in midlife (almand behne,2015). both young and
middle-aged women seem to be better at speechreading than
men. furthermore, middle-aged women were more
influenced by visual speech than their male peers, as
measured by proportion of fusion responses in a mcgurk
effect task. results showed that women were more likely
than men to respond with an alveolar consonant (e.g. /ta/)
when presented with incongruent audiovisual stimuli
consisting of auditory presentation of a bilabial consonant
(eg. [pa/) while seeing the production of a velar consonant
(eg, /ka]). this gender difference was not linked to hearing
loss and was not observed in younger adults.

 

the ability to recognize speech from seeing a talker's face
thus weakens across the adult lifespan, but individuals who
the ability to recognize speech from seeing a talker's face
thus weakens across the adult lifespan, but individuals who
are better at speechreading earlier in their life, such as
women, seem to be able to keep their advantage as they age.
this result dovetails with other evidence showing that
extensive experience with using visual speech earlier in life
can help to mitigate deterioration of speechreading in
midlife. middle-aged adults with sensorineural hearing loss
that started earlier in life (between 7 and 25 years prior to
when they participated in the study) were better
speechreaders than middle-aged adults with normal hearing
(pelsonand prather, 1974). among middle-aged adults with
sensorineural hearing loss, the onset of the hearing loss, and
not its severity, predicted their speechreading ability
(tillbergetal., 1996). a group of middle-aged adults with
earlier onset hearing loss (between 4 years of age and 34
years of age, average 15 years) performed worse than a group
with later onset hearing loss (27-55 years of age, average 45
years) when presented with auditory-only speech but
outperformed them on visual-only presentations. however,
with later onset hearing loss (27-55 years of age, average 45
years) when presented with auditory-only speech but
outperformed them on visual-only presentations. however,
both groups achieved similar recognition rates when tested
with audiovisual presentations. taken together, these results
suggest that individuals who presumably have more
experience with speechreading at an early age (due to
hearing loss) can preserve some of their ability to effectively
process information from visual speech as they age.

 

few studies directly assessed audiovisual speech perception
in middle-aged adults. to be able to compare audiovisual
processing across age groups, it is crucial to distinguish the
relative contributions of differences in the processing of
auditory and visual speech from differences in the integration
of information across the two modalities. a large-scale cross-
sectional study (tye-murrayetal., 2016) of adults between the
ages of 22 and 92 showed that when controlling for age-
related declines in visual and auditory speech processing, the
audiovisual benefit remained stable across the adult lifespan.
likewise, despite the presence of age-related decline in
related aeciines in'visuaf ana‘ dtaitory speécn prdcessing, the
audiovisual benefit remained stable across the adult lifespan.
likewise, despite the presence of age-related decline in
speechreading, older and middle-aged adults with bilateral
moderate-to-severe hearing loss achieved equivalently high
recognition rates for audiovisually-presented speech
materials, when matched on their auditory-only performance
(waldenetal., 1993), similar results were found for older and
middle-aged adults with cochlear implants (hay-
mccutcheonetal., 2009). for at least simple tasks involving
the recognition of a small set of consonant vowel syllables,
middle-aged adults can achieve the same audiovisual benefit
as younger adults (almand behne,2015).

  

 

 

in summary, middle-aged adults retain the ability to benefit
from seeing the talker's face. age-related differences found in
processing audiovisual speech seem entirely due to
differences in auditory and visual processing rather than in
audiovisual integration (see also sommersetal., 2005).
3. speech understanding in middle-aged adults

pure-tone hearing loss is an inadequate indicator of how
much difficulty middle-aged adults believe they experience
in adverse acoustic environments. demeesteretal. (2012)

found that middle-aged (55-65 years) people with normal
hearing sensitivity reported significantly more problems in
challenging listening situations than younger adults. in an
analysis of nhanes data, kamiletal. (2014) determined that
people in their 50s tended to overestimate their hearing
problems, while older adults tended to underestimate them.
similar findings were noted by bainbridge and wallhagen
(2014), where the prevalence of middle-aged adults reporting
subjective hearing difficulty was greater than the prevalence
of objective pure-tone hearing loss in this population. this
pattern was reversed in older adults. data from our lab
supports this disconnect between self-perceived hearing
culty and hearing thresholds: speech and spatial

between older and middle-aged adults in how adequately
individuals felt they can function in adverse listening
conditions, even though the older participants had
substantially more hearing loss and so would be expected to
experience more problems in these situations (helferetal.,
2017).

 

 

what are the reasons behind this discrepancy between
objective and subjective hearing ability in middle-aged
adults? certainly, there are auditory abilities that may be
impacted earlier in the aging process (and/or to a greater
degree) than pure-tone hearing sensitivity. tasks that have a
substantial temporal component appear to be most sensitive
to early aging, including measures of temporal fine structure
processing (fiillgrabe,2013; groseand mamo,2010) and gap
detection or discrimination (e.g., groseetal., 2006;
humesetal., 2010; leigh-paffenrothand elangoven,2011;
listeretal., 2002; ozmeraletal., 2016). changes in the way the
auditory system processes fundamental aspects of sounds
likely contribute to problems segregating sound sources (e.g.,
fiillgrabeetal., 2015; neheretal., 2012; summersand
leels.1998) an abiltwthat icatconsiderah|eimnortance.
likely contribute to problems segregating sound sources (e.g.,
fiillgrabeetal., 2015; neheretal., 2012; summersand

leek, 1998), an ability that is of considerable importance
when trying to listen to one voice in the presence of other
voices. the underlying reasons contributing to a decline in
psychoacoustic abilities by middle age have not yet been
established, but it should be noted that even very mild
peripheral hearing joss may disrupt performance on these
(and other) auditory tasks (e.g., bernsteinand trahiotis,2019;
giroudetal., 2018).

 

the problems reported by middle-aged people often revolve
around understanding speech in complex acoustic
environments with multiple talkers. these subjective
complaints have been confirmed in research studies
demonstrating that middle-aged adults have particular
difficulty understanding speech in the presence of speech
maskers (e.g,, baskentetal., 2014; cameronetal., 2011;
fiillgrabeetal., 2015; glydeetal., 2013; hannulaetal., 2011;
shinn-cunninghametal., 2013; tremblayetal., 2015;
wileyetal., 1998). data from our labs has consistently shown
fiillgrabeetal., 2015; glydeetal., 2013; hannulaetal., 2011;
shinn-cunninghametal., 2013; tremblayetal., 2015;
wileyetal., 1998). data from our labs has consistently shown
that middle-aged adults’ performance is similar to that of
younger adults when the masker is steady-state or
fluctuating noise, but closer to that of older listeners when
the masker is understandable speech (helferand
freyman,2014; helfer and freyman, 2016; helferetal., 2018;
helferand jesse, 2015; helferetal., 2016; helferand
vargo,2009; jesseand helfer,2019).

 

these functional changes in speech understanding are likely
based on a complex interplay of age-related alterations in
peripheral auditory, central auditory, and cognitive
processing. increasing evidence also shows anatomical
changes in the central auditory system beginning relatively
early in the aging process, especially in individuals who have
elevated pure-tone thresholds. for example,
neuschwanderetal. (2019) recently documented that age-
related hearing loss can lead to reduced thickness in auditory
cortex in middle-aged individuals. the interaction of hearing
neuschwanderetal. ( 2u1y) recently dociimented that age-
related hearing loss can lead to reduced thickness in auditory
cortex in middle-aged individuals. the interaction of hearing
loss and cognition is discussed later in this paper.

 

3.1. speech perception in face-to-face
communication

many of our conversations take place face-to-face. in these
face-to-face conversations, listeners process and combine the
information obtained from hearing and seeing a speaker talk
in order to determine what was said. access to audiovisual
speech renders recognition more robust (for an overview, see
massaroand jesse,2008). listeners of all ages are more likely
to recognize correctly what the speaker said if they have
access to both auditory and visual information than when
they only receive auditory information (e.g,, jesseand
janse,2012; jesseetal., 2000; macleodand

summerfield, 1987; massaroetal., 1986; rossetal., 2011; tye-
murrayetal., 2016). this audiovisual gain typically exceeds
what would be predicted from taking an unweighted sum of
the performance scores of auditorv-onlv and visual-onlv _
murrayetal., 2016). this audiovisual gain typically exceeds
what would be predicted from taking an unweighted sum of
the performance scores of auditory-only and visual-only
conditions. its size is in part determined by the relative
distribution of information across the modalities, in that
audiovisual gains are larger to the degree that the two
sources complement each other in the information they
provide rather than providing duplicate information
(grantand walden, 1996; jesseand massaro, 2010;
waldenetal., 1974).

 

 

not surprisingly, access to visual speech becomes more
important when hearing is impaired. in a group consisting of
middle-aged and older adults, audiovisual benefits for the
detection of target words in a continuous speech stream
accompanied by multitalker babble noise tended to be larger
for those individuals with a greater degree of high-frequency
hearing loss (puschmannetal., 2019). however, this positive
association was largely due to a negative correlation between
hearing loss and performance in the auditory-only
presentation condition. this latter relationship is to be

ion was largely due to a negative correlation between
hearing loss and performance in the auditory-only
presentation condition. this latter relationship is to be
expected as even in young adults with normal hearing, lower
recognition scores for auditory-only presentations tend to
lead to larger audiovisual gains. for example, a further
analysis of data from jesseetal. (2000), displayed in fig. 1,
shows a negative correlation between the recognition of cid
(central institute for the deaf) sentences from auditory-only
presentations (presented with speech noise) and the
observed audiovisual gain, measured as the difference in
recognition scores between audiovisual and auditory
conditions (r=-.82, t(69)=11.73, p< .00001). information
obtained from seeing a speaker can, however, help overcome
deficits in speech perception due to age-related high-
frequency hearing loss. for example, puschmannetal. (2019)
found that hearing loss only predicted performance in an
auditory speech-in-noise condition (despite individually
adjusting the speech-to-noise ratio) but not in an audiovisual
condition in their group of middle-aged and older adults.

2. hearing sensitivity in middle-aged adults

most middle-aged adults do not have hearing sensitivity like
they had when they were younger. by the time they reach
middle age, a substantial proportion of adults have
measurable hearing loss. results of the beaver dam offspring
study demonstrate that hearing loss is relatively common
among middle-aged adults, with prevalence of hearing loss
(defined as thresholds in either ear between 500 hz and 4
khz greater than 25 db hl) of about 11% of adults 45-54 years
of age and 26% of individuals 55-64 years of age (nashetal.,
(defined as thresholds in either ear between 500 hz and 4
khz greater than 25 db hl) of about 11% of adults 45-54 years
of age and 26% of individuals 55-64 years of age (nashetal.,
2011). wangetal. (2019) reported results of a cross-sectional
study of hearing in adults between 30 years and 59 years of
age. of their participants in the 50-54 year range, 9% had
thresholds > 25 db hl bilaterally (mean of thresholds for 1
khz, 2 khz, and 4 khz pure tones); in the 55-59-year age
range, prevalence increased to 22%. when considering high
frequency hearing (the average of 4 khz and 8 khz
thresholds), prevalence was even higher, at 14% in the 50-54
group and 44% in the 55-59 group. likewise, the busselton
baby boomer cohort found that 21% of middle-aged adults
(45-66 years) had high-frequency hearing loss (bucksetal.,
2016). results of large epidemiological studies that use
automated speech-in-noise tests instead of pure-tone
threshold assessment also suggest that age-related changes
in these measures begin by middle age in many individuals
(dawesetal., 2014; nacheegaaletal., 2009). taken as a whole,
these epidemiological studies point to the fact that hearing
begins to change relatively early in the aging process in many
(dawesetal., 2014; nacheegaaletal., 2009). taken as a whole,
these epidemiological studies point to the fact that hearing
begins to change relatively early in the aging process in many
adults.

as discussed below, a proportion of individuals who have
what would be considered “normal” audiograms report
considerable difficulty understanding speech in adverse
listening situations. one reason this might be the case is that
clinical audiometric pure-tone testing generally only extends
up to 8 khz. it has long been known that frequencies above 8
khz are vulnerable to both noise exposure and early aging
(eg. jileketal., 2014; yeendetal., 2017). several studies have
demonstrated that pure-tone thresholds above 8 khz, often
referred to as extended high frequency (ehf) thresholds, can
contribute to explaining a portion of inter-subject variability
in speech understanding in noise. badrietal. (2011) compared
the hearing thresholds of two groups of adults between 18
years and 50 years of age who either did or did not self-
report speech perception problems in noisy situations. pure-
tone thresholds at conventional audiometric frequencies did
years sha su yéars of age wno etner aia or aia not seit:
report speech perception problems in noisy situations. pure-
tone thresholds at conventional audiometric frequencies did
not differ significantly between these two groups, but the
group with self-reported hearing problems had higher ehf
thresholds. these results suggest that elevated ehf
thresholds could contribute to people's perceptions of
ificulty understanding speech in noise. other studies
measuring objective speech perception have demonstrated
the value of ehfs for listening to one talker in the presence of
competing talkers (levyetal., 2015; monson etal., 2014;
mooreetal., 2010). accordingly, yeend etal. (yeendetal., 2019)
found that among adults 30-57 years, ehf thresholds
together with working memory explained 41% of total
variance in a composite speech-i

 

noise metric.

 

why should ehf thresholds affect speech understanding,
given that the spectral information that is most important for
speech perception is primarily in lower frequencies, and that
there is only a limited amount of acoustic energy that is
audible in the ehf range when speech is presented at typical
conversational levels? fhf engrev in consonants can be
there is only a limited amount of acoustic energy that is

audible in the ehf range when speech is presented at typical
conversational levels? ehf energy in consonants can be
helpful for perceiving those sounds when information at
lower frequencies is not available (e.g. lippmann, 1996) or
when speech is embedded in noise (apouxand bacon,2004).
ithas been proposed that information in the ehf range
serves as a grouping cue to help individuals segregate target
voice information from background sounds (monson etal.
2014), moreover, providing energy in an extended high
frequency range contributes to speech being perceived as
more natural (mooreand tan,2003). another consideration is
that elevated ehf thresholds maybe a sign of cochlear
synaptopathy or “hidden hearing loss” (libermanetal., 2016)
and so may be a marker for people whose speech
understanding in noise is compromised by the presence of
that condition. the reasons why ehf thresholds are
associated with speech understanding are yet to be
determined, but what is known so far points to the idea that

ificulty understanding speech in adverse listening
situations.

 

  

 

as the research discussed above indicates, many middle-aged
adults have at least some degree of elevation of auditory
thresholds. although measuring pure-tone hearing is of
obvious clinical value, it gives us only limited insight into
how adequately people can understand speech in real-world
situations. next we focus on research that directly examines
subjective and objective speech understanding in middle-
aged adults.
1. introduction

problems with hearing and understanding speech in noisy
environments become increasingly common as people age,
and for the most part these problems do not come on
suddenly. rather, these difficulties often begin to emerge
during middle age. yet most research on aging compares
performance of younger adults to that of older adults (> 60 -
65 years of age) with little consideration of what happens in
the interim age span. this approach leaves researchers and
practitioners with only a limited understanding of the
problems faced by adults in this critical age range and an
the interim age span. this approach leaves researchers and
practitioners with only a limited understanding of the
problems faced by adults in this critical age range and an
incomplete picture of the time frame for changes in various
aspects of auditory functioning and speech understanding.
this article provides a review of what is known about
changes in hearing and speech understanding in the midlife
period (from approximately 45 years of age to 64 years of
age) and concludes with clinical and research implications.

abstract

middle-aged adults often report a decline in their ability to
understand speech in adverse listening situations. however,
there has been relatively little research devoted to ide!
how early aging affects speech processing, as the majority of
investigations into senescent changes in speech
understanding compare performance in groups of young and
older adults. this paper provides an overview of research on
hearing and speech perception in middle-aged adults. topics
covered include both objective and subjective (self-
perceived) hearing and speech understanding, listening
effort, and audiovisual speech perception. this review ends
with justification for future research needed to define the
nature, consequences, and remediation of hearing problems
in middle-aged adults.

highlights
+ changes to subjective and objective hearing are
common among middle-aged adults.

 

+ elevated pure-tone thresholds can explain only a
portion of objective problems.

+ audiovisual speech processing remains intact
with aging.
+ middle-aged adults exert more effort in speech

understanding than younger adults.

+ research on middle-aged adults is important to
discover pathways to healthy aging.
