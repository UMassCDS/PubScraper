4, summary

this study describes five distinct mineral horizons observed
at mawrth vallis in the light-toned, layered units: fe?*/mg-
smectite, ferrous clays, spectral “doublet” materials, al-
phyllosilicates, and np-aluminosilicates. these layered
outcrops observed at mawrth vallis are thicker than in other
regions of mars, but may represent processes that took place
on a wider scale across mars during the noachian time
period, observations at mawrth vallis are consistent with the

 

regions of mars, but may represent processes that took place
on a wider scale across mars during the noachian time
period. observations at mawrth vallis are consistent with the
formation of fe3*-rich smectites in a warm and wet neutral
environment, a transition to alteration in acidic waters during
a period of evaporative settings with wet/dry cycling,
crystallization of al-rich phyllosilicates through pedogenesis
or leaching in warm, acidic waters, followed by colder
conditions where the persistence of np-aluminosilicates
mark the end of the warm and wet clay-forming climate on
mars. poorly crystalline materials including allophane,
imogolite, ferrihydrite, akaganéite, and schwertmannite
would be stable long-term on mars in the absence of liquid
water, but would all alter to form crystalline minerals in
warm and wet environments. because these poorly
crystalline phases are observed at the top of the clay
stratigraphy at mawrth vallis, these signal a long-term dry
and cold climate. the layered clay-bearing outcrops at
mawrth vallis are draped by np-aluminosilicates and covered
by caprock. this stratigraphy is observed today where the
surface has been eroded, . .
mawrth vallis are draped by np-aluminosilicates and covered
by caprock. this stratigraphy is observed today where the
surface has been eroded.

the layered, light-toned phyllosilicate-rich outcrops at
mawrth vallis are indicators of changing chemistry that could
record an ancient active chemical environment supportive of
habitable conditions and would also be able to preserve
evidence of ecosystems, if present on ancient mars, over
geologic timescales. alteration of the fe*/mg-smectite unit
to produce some fe?* in the phyllosilicate at the surface of
this unit could be an indicator of heating due to impacts, of
redox reactions taking place in reduced fluids, or biologic
activity. small outcrops of ca-sulfates, jarosite and alunite are
present in pockets between the thick, lower fe/mg-smectite
unit and the upper al-phyllosilicate unit. a few isolated
regions exhibit spectral properties most consistent with
these sulfates, while most occurrences are mixtures with
phyllosilicates or hydrated silica. comparison with terrestrial
outcrops containing ca-sulfates, jarosite, al-phyllosilicates,
and silica/opal suggests that these acidic or salty units at
phyllosilicates or hydrated silica. comparison with terrestrial
outcrops containing ca-sulfates, jarosite, al-phyllosilicates,
and silica/opal suggests that these acidic or salty units at
mawrth vallis formed in evaporative environments.
alteration in saline and acidic waters could have posed
challenges for life, if present, on early mars; however, such
chemically extreme environments on earth in western
australia and the atacama desert contain active ecosystems,
indicating that life could have been possible as well in the
clay-sulfate assemblages of the martian “doublet” unit
outcrops described here.
one explanation for this doublet feature could be that
mixtures of the sulfate minerals jarosite and gypsum are
present with different relative abundances. these minerals
are not typically co-located because jarosite forms in low-ph
mixtures of the silltate minerals jardsité aiid gypsum are
present with different relative abundances. these minerals
are not typically co-located because jarosite forms in low-ph
environments, while gypsum more typically forms in neutral
waters, however, they are observed together in some high
salt environments such as saline lakes in western australia
(benison and bowen, 2006) and the atacama desert in chile
(flahaut et al., 2017). one region of the painted desert also
features a sulfate hill with co-located jarosite and gypsum
(perrin et al., 2018). vnir spectra of mixtures prepared in the
laboratory also include doublets in the 2.2-2.3ym range for
jarosite-gypsum (perrin et al., 2018), jarosite-nontronite
(usabal and bishop, 2018), and gypsum-opal (miura and
bishop, 2018). another explanation for this “doublet” feature
is acid alteration of the fe-rich smectite unit. lab
experiments with acid-treated smectites (madejova et al.,
1998) and poorly crystalline fe-sio2 phases precipitated in
acidic solutions (tosca et al., 2008) include 2-3 bands in the
2.2-2.34m region that vary in band center and band shape
depending on the reaction conditions. hydrothermal
alteration of ash near cinder cones, fumeroles, and fresh lava
2.2-2.3 im region that vaiy in band ceitter and band shape
depending on the reaction conditions. hydrothermal
alteration of ash near cinder cones, fumeroles, and fresh lava
also produces mixtures of jarosite, hydrated silica, and
smectites (e.g., bishop et al., 2005; bishop et al., 2007; yant et
al., 2017). because of the variation in band centers in addition
to changes in relative intensity observed for this “doublet”
unit at mawrth vallis (fig. 4c), this unit is attributed to a
complex suite of materials rather than a simple mixture.
these “doublet” features are consistent with mixtures of ca
sulfates, oh-bearing sulfates and clays, or acid alteration of
clays. thus, this unit likely represents a time period where
salty, evaporative environments existed. saline lakes (e.g.,
benison and bowen, 2006) or salars (eg., flahaut et al., 2017)
exhibit highly variable mineralogy within tens or hundreds of
meters that is consistent with the spectral variations
observed for this “doublet” unit at mawrth vallis. these salty
evaporite regions also represent a range of acidic to mildly
acidic to neutral waters. the presence of saline and/or aci
waters could have posed challenges for the evolution of life
on early mars; however, shallow, saline ponds on earth are

 

 

acidic to neutral waters. the presence of saline and/or ac
waters could have posed challenges for the evolution of life
on early mars; however, shallow, saline ponds on earth are
enriched with abundant microbial communities (e.g. benison
et al., 2008; conner and benison, 2013; johnson et al., 2015;
benison, 2019; johnson et al., 2020).

 

   

 

in order to evaluate the “doublet” type unit in more detail, we
investigated the tiny outcrops containing potential jarosite-
bearing units (danielsen and bishop, 2018). crism spectra in
fig. 6 attributed to jarosite include bands at 1.47, 1.86 and
2.27 ym (bishop and murad, 2005) and are found in several
tiny outcrops throughout mawrth vallis (bishop et al., 2016;
danielsen and bishop, 2018; usabal et al., 2019). spectra of
jarosite also include a shoulder or weak band near 2.22-
2.23um. many of the doublet-type spectra have bands near
2.22-2.23 and 2.26-2.27ym that are roughly similar to the
positions of the jarosite bands, although the relative intensity
is inconsistent with jarosite, and other diagnostic jarosite
features are missing (e.g., farrand et al., 2009). however,
imilar acid-alteration processes are likely responsible for the
formvianatitha dayblettura mvan7 wag iasevi far vone
features are missing (e.g., farrand et al., 2009). however,
similar acid-alteration processes are likely responsible for the
formation of the doublet-type material and jarosite.
investigation of the sites where jarosite features (1.86, 2.22,
and 2.27pm) are observed and where “doublet” type features
are observed shows that they occur in neighboring deposits.
the small occurrences of jarosite may indicate localities
where acidic conditions persisted longer, thus enabling its
formation. analysis of jarosite mixtures indicate that the
1.86 um band is only present in systems that contain more
jarosite than other sulfate or clay minerals (perrin et al., 2018;
usabal et al., 2018).

  

 

 

spectra of the ca sulfates bassanite and gypsum (bishop et al.,
2014) also contain a doublet near 2.22 and 2.26um, similar to
jarosite features and a band near 1.75 4m, similar to that of
alunite (bishop and murad, 2005). thus, mixtures of these
sulfates can be difficult to distinguish. bassanite was
identified previously in small outcrops in at least one part of
the mawrth vallis region (wray et al., 2010); thus ca sulfates
could be present in other forms as well. additional detailed

in the shape and character of this “doublet” signature within
single crism images, while similar types of features are
noted in the northern, eastern, and southern parts of this
region.

3.3. characterization of the ferrous spectral unit

just above the thick nontronite type unit in many locations
throughout mawrth vallis is a thin horizon containing
weaker fe/mg-smectite features and a positive slope from ~1
to 1.8um that is characteristic of bands due to electronic
excitations in ferrous materials (e.g., burns, 1993). this
enhanced positive slope is caused by a broad band arising
from an fe?*-fe* charge transfer transition in phyllosilicates
(eg. faye, 1968; anderson and stucki, 1979; lear and stucki,
1987). typically, this increase in the ferrous signature is
finwatet resraal gearasier tiasnibir he prpawsiticaces
(eg. faye, 1968; anderson and stucki, 1979; lear and stucki,
1987). typically, this increase in the ferrous signature is
observed at the top of the nontronite unit where both a
positive slope from ~1 to 1.8ym and a nontronite band near
2.29um are observed for only a couple of pixels in the crism
scene (40-60m), then the nontronite band disappears further
up the stratigraphic column. in some cases, only the ferrous
slope is present, while in other cases, bands characteristic of
ferrous clays are present and in others the ferrous slope is
combined with the “doublet” type features, indicating a
mixture of the ferrous material with the “doublet” type unit
above it.

 

this fe?*-bearing unit could be a mixture of nontronite with
ferrous clays such as glauconite (fe2*mg-mica), chamosite
(fe2*-rich chlorite with some mg) and celadonite (mg-rich
chlorite with some fe?*), or it could be a reduced form of
nontronite (e.g., lear and stucki, 1987; stucki, 2006; chemtob
et al., 2015). reduction of fe* in nontronite also causes
deprotonation of the oh bound to octahedral cations and
decreases the intensity of the oh spectral features (manceau
et al., 2015). reduction of fe* in nontronite also causes
deprotonation of the oh bound to octahedral cations and
decreases the intensity of the oh spectral features (manceau
et al., 2000; fialips et al., 2002). mixtures of nontronite and
ferrous clays or other ferrous minerals also exhibit nonlinear
changes in the spectral features, where small amounts of
ferrous minerals produced a prominent effect on the mixture
spectra (saper and bishop, 2011; bishop et al., 2013b). thus,
an fe2*-bearing phyllosilicate could be mixed with the lower
nontronite or upper “doublet” unit, but not be a major
component of this unit and still contribute an increasing
slope from ~1 to 1.8m. studies of nontronites heated to
300°c produced partially irreversible formation of fe?*
species with an upward slope in reflectance spectra from ~1
to 1.8um (morris et al. 2009). these experiments indicate
that alteration due to a heating event such as impacts on
mars could be converting a small portion of the fe?* to fe?* at
the surface of the fe/mg-smectite boundary. this would
change the spectral properties of the material, but not greatly
change the bulk properties of the unit. a ferrous phase could
also have been formed due to a redox process when the
change the spectral properties of the material, but not greatly
change the bulk properties of the unit. a ferrous phase could
also have been formed due to a redox process when the
upper salty, sulfate, and/or al/si-rich units formed, then
intermixed with each of the phyllosilicate units near their
boundary.

achange from a lower fe?* to an upper fe?* unit in the
stratigraphy is rather unusual and implies that the ferric
smectite was present first and then altered to form a ferrous-
bearing material. redox experiments on fe-rich
phyllosilicates in the laboratory have shown that fe** in
phyllosilicate structures can be reduced via chemical or
iological processes (e.g., stucki, 2006; dong et al., 2009);
however, microbial reduction is a common process to convert
fe* to fe?* in clay minerals (e.g., dong et al., 2009, and
references therein). anaerobic microbes facilitate these
reactions in soils, sediments, and hydrothermal environments
on earth, and smectites (e.g., montmorillonite, nontronite)
have been found to provide the highest reduction rates,
which was attributed to their expandable layer structures

have been found to provide the highest reduction rates,

(stucki et al., 1987; gates et al., 1998; dong et al., 2003;
stucki, 2006; jaisi et al., 2007; dong et al., 2009). redox
gradients and chemical disequilibria can provide sources of
energy for microbes and could be an indicator of habitable
environments (bishop et al., 2013a; horgan et al., 2015;
bishop, 2018).

 

 

3.4. relationships between mineralogy and
climate

the 100-200m thick deposit of fe*/mg-smectite plus ferric
oxide-bearing phases likely occurred in a neutral to slightly
basic aqueous environment. in regions such as mawrth vallis,
where this smectite is not accompanied by high temperature
minerals and sedimentary features are observed, this fe?*-
rich smectite likely formed in short-term (tens to 100s of
thousands of years), warm (5-10°c mean annual temperature
with seasonal highs up to 20-30°c) and wet surface
prvsarants au tthe noa sian teth rain and racine of
thousands of years), warm (5-10°c mean annual temperature
with seasonal highs up to 20-30°c) and wet surface
environments during the noachian with rain and leaching of
the basalt (bishop et al., 2018). as described above, alteration
of the fe3*/mg-smectite unit to produce some fe?* in the
phyllosilicate at the surface of this unit could be an indicator
of heating due to impacts, volcanism or magmatic processes,
of redox reactions taking place in reduced fluids, or biologic
activity. if the ferrous clays formed due to reduction and
dehydration through heating, then there was likely an
extended period of dry climate during this time. if the ferrous
clays formed due to redox reactions then the surface of the
100-200m thick fe?*-rich smectite deposit must have been
wet (e.g,, bishop et al., 2013a). this could have been achieved
ina cold, moist environment with transient liquid water. a
fresh supply of fe2*-bearing volcanic ash could also have
been deposited on top of the lower fe?*-rich smectite unit in
an environment with limited water that was too cold for
smectite formation. alternatively, fresh fe2*-bearing ash
soaked in warm, low-ph waters would have supported
frrenvinnatéar ars clayieat ead anaenas wad wr
smectite formation. alternatively, fresh fe2*-bearing ash
soaked in warm, low-ph waters would have supported
formation of ferrous clays rather than nontronite (e.g.,
chevrier et al., 2007).

 

the mawrth vallis clay-bearing stratigraphy contains the
spectral “doublet” material with infrequent, small pockets of
jarosite in a thin unit above the ferrous clays. the variable
nature of the thickness and composition of the “doublet” type
unit implies changing conditions across mawrth vallis to
produce mixtures of sulfates and clay minerals and acid
alteration of the fe3*-rich smectite unit. this is consistent
with an evaporative (e.g., benison and bowen, 2006) or
hydrothermal (eg., bishop et al., 2005) environment. shallow,
saline pools would be easier to explain on mars at the end of
the noachian and beginning of the hesperian period because
liquid water was likely less stable on the surface of the planet
at this time (e.g., fassett and head, 2008; bishop et al., 2018)
and there is no evidence of volcanic activity near mawrth
vallis (robbins et al., 2011). this “doublet” unit is then

 

and there is no evidence of volcanic activity near mawrth
vallis (robbins et al., 2011). this “doublet” unit is then
covered by the al-rich phyllosilicate unit. the transition from
ferrous clays to salty/sulfate/clay mixtures to al-
phyllosilicates could be explained by aqueous alteration in
acidic waters. this was suggested to describe the co-
occurrence of jarosite and alunite with al-rich phyllosilicates
in several locations across mars (ehlmann and dundar, 2015).
related “doublet” type features attributed to mixtures of
jarosite and clays have been identified at lus chasma (roach
et al., 2010; flahaut et al., 2014) and noctis labyrinthus
(weitz et al., 2011). a change from near-neutral waters
supporting formation of fe*-rich smectite to a drier epoch
with occasional acidic waters could explain the observed
stratigraphy at mawrth vallis. because the same trend in
mineral horizons is observed across thousands of km, the
aqueous processes occurring there must have been wide-
spread rather than isolated. these alteration episodes
occurred at the surface and the rocks have not been

‘icantly modified since then by deep burial or high water
activity. :

occurred at the surface and the rocks have not been
ignificantly modified since then by deep burial or high water
activity.

 

 

 

finally, covering the surface of the clay-rich stratigraphy
across mawrth vallis is a unit dominated by poorly
crystalline, nanophase and amorphous materials such as
allophane and imogolite (bishop and rampe, 2016).
formation of allophane and imogolite from volcanic glass is
favored over smectite clay formation in either low water/rock
ratio environments at moderate temperatures or cold
climates with high water/rock ratios (chamley, 1989; parfitt,
2009; rasmussen et al., 2010). other fe oxide-bearing
nanophase and poorly crystalline phases such as ferrihydrite,
schwertmannite, and akaganéite have been identified on
mars (poulet et al., 2008; carter et al., 2015b) and could have
also formed in cooler environments that did not favor
formation of crystalline fe oxides/hydroxides (e.g., bishop
and murad, 2002; cornell and schwertmann, 2003). thus, the
presence of abundant nanophase aluminos
phyllosilicates could mark the end of the warm and wet

and murad, 2002; cornell and schwertmann, 2003). thus, the
presence of abundant nanophase aluminos
phyllosilicates could mark the end of the warm and wet
surface conditions supporting smectite formation (bishop et
al., 2018).

the “doublet” type clay-sulfate assemblages identified in this
study are consistent with precipitates and sediments from
saline lake environments described previously (e.g., benison
and laclair, 2003; benison and bowen, 2006; flahaut et al.,
2017; benison, 2019) and may be related to the acid saline
environment at eagle crater, meridiani, where gypsum- and
jarosite-bearing sediments were identified (squyres et al.,
2004). the saline, acid brine lakes in western australia and
chile are among the most chemically extreme environments
on earth and host many diverse ecosystems of extremophiles
(eg. warren-rhodes et al., 2007; mormile et al., 2009;
wierzchos et al. 2011; johnson et al., 2015; johnson et al.,
2020). the water chemistry of these acid lakes in western
australia fluctuates with flooding and evaporation, producing
acidity levels measured at ~1-7ph and salinities as high as

australia fluctuates with flooding and evaporation, producing
acidity levels measured at ~1-7ph and salinities as high as
32% dissolved solids (benison et al., 2007; bowen and
benison, 2009). minerals in these acid lake environments trap
organic materials and microorganisms and preserve them
over geologically long periods of time (benison, 2019). thus,
continued investigation of these clay-sulfate assemblages on
mars may provide information to help constrain
environments that could have preserved ecosystems if they
in fact developed on mars.

close-up views of the 2.1-2.4um range illustrate the
variations observed for the “doublet” type outcrops at
mawrth vallis (fig. 4b) and the minerals gypsum, jarosite,
gibbsite, and butlerite (fig. 4c). in addition to these minerals,
acid treated smectite (ats) exhibits a doublet feature here
(madejova et al., 1998), as well as some mineral mixtures.
spectra are included in fig. 4c of a lab mixture of equal
weight proportions of jarosite and gypsum and a painted
desert soil sample containing more jarosite than gypsum
(perrin et al., 2018) that are examples of mixtures having a
spectral doublet feature. spectra of poorly crystalline fe-si0
phases (tosca et al., 2008) and some smectites with mixed
cations exhibit a broad shoulder feature in this region (not
shown) that could also be related to the “doublet” unit.

 

 

the spectral features near 2.2-2.3m in smectites vary with
the type of cation that is connected to oh in the octahedral

when al is sufficiently abundant such that nearly all oh
groups have two al cations bound to them (bishop et al.,
2002). this band is broadened or a shoulder develops near
2.23um for smectites with some alfe?*oh sites. similarly, the
oh combination vibration for the fe?* 0h sites in nontronite
occurs at 2.283-2.288ym when fe** is sufficiently abundant
that nearly all oh groups have two fe?* cations bound to
them, and a shoulder occurs near 2.23ym for samples such as
swa-1 ferruginous smectite where some alfe?*oh sites are
present as well as fe?*oh sites (bishop et al., 2002).
sediments containing al-rich nontronite also include this
band near 2.28ym plus a shoulder at shorter wavelengths
(eg. bristow et al., 2018). some regions of mawrth vallis do
exhibit features (oh combination band and shoulder) that
could be consistent with mixed cation smectites; however,
the “doublet” type features that are the focus of this

bottom of the profile. the center column highlights variations
in the “doublet” type unit (green/yellow/orange) in relation
to the nontronite-rich unit (blue). materials with more
jarosite character are mapped in yellow-green and other
“doublet” type phases are mapped in yellow-orange tones.
the right column represents the materials dominated by al
and si in blue and those dominated by fe and mg in red,

while the “doublet” type regions are mapped in white. these
image views on the right clearly show the white “doublet”
unit in between the lower red nontronite type material and
the upper blue al/si type materials. because the “doublet”
unit occurs in between the al/si-rich upper unit and fe/mg-
rich lower unit, a logical assumption would be that the
“doublet” unit is simply a mixture of these two units.
however, the band centers and relative intensities of the two
bands vary widely (figs. 4b, 6). the spectral properties of
these “doublet” materials are thus more complex than simple
mixtures. selected spectra from the mawrth vallis region are
shown in fig. 6 compared with lab spectra of related phases
in order to illustrate the variations among the “doublet” type
units and the differences between the “doublet” type phases
and the other units present. because of the variety of spectral
features observed for the “doublet” unit, there are likely
multiple processes occurring. some areas may actually be

in order to reduce the averaging over multiple surface

1. introduction

investigation of phyllosilicate-bearing deposits on mars
provides an opportunity to evaluate aqueous activity and
changes in climate. the mawrth vallis region lies at the
border of the southern highlands and the northern lowlands
near 22-25°n and 17-21°w. it is defined by the mawrth
vallis channel and the ~100-km wide oyama crater, and has
been modified by numerous impact craters and small outflow
tributaries, as well as volcanism (e.g., 3

analysis of hyperspectral visible/near-infrared (vnir) spectra
acquired by the compact reconnaissance imaging
spectrometer for mars (crism) on board the mars
reconnaissance orbiter (mro) has shown thick, complex
profiles of phyllosilicates at mawrth vallis, consistent with
aqueous alteration and active chemistry (eg.

phyllosilicates occur in finely-layered profiles 300m or more
thick ( ). recent modeling of phyllosilicate

formation conditions suggests that these phyllosilicate-rich
units could have formed during short-term warm and wet
environments in an otherwise cold early mars (

). because of the altered noachian rocks, abundant
phyllosilicates, changing redox conditions, evidence of
habitable conditions, and likely preservation of biosignatures

refined calibrations of crism images are enabling
identification of smaller deposits of unique aqueous
materials on mars that reveal changing environmental
conditions at the region surrounding mawrth vallis. through
characterization of these clay-sulfate assemblages and their
association with the layered, phyllosilicate units of this
region, more details of the aqueous geochemical history can
be gleaned. a stratigraphy including five distinct mineral
horizons is mapped using compositional data from crism
over ctx and hrsc imagery across 100s of km and from

horizons is mapped using compositional data from crism
over ctx and hrsc imagery across 100s of km and from
crism over hirise imagery across 100s of meters. transitions
in mineralogic units were characterized using visible/near-
infrared (vnir) spectral properties and surface morphology.
we identified and characterized complex “doublet” type
spectral signatures with two bands between 2.2 and 2.3m at
one stratigraphic horizon. based on comparisons with
terrestrial sites, the spectral “doublet” unit described here
may reflect the remnants of a salty, evaporative period that
existed on mars during the transition from formation of fe-
rich phyllosilicates to al-rich phyllosilicates. layered outcrops
observed at mawrth vallis are thicker than in other altered
regions of mars, but may represent processes that were more
widespread in wet regions of the planet during its early
history. the aqueous geochemical environments supporting
the outcrops observed here include: (i) the formation of fe3*-
rich smectites in a warm and wet environment, (ii) overlain
bya thin ferrous-bearing clay unit that could be associated
with heating or reducing conditions, (iii) followed by a

transition to salty and/or acidic alteration phases and sulfates
(characterized by the spectral “doublet” shape) in an
evaporative setting, (iv) formation of al-rich phyllosilicates
through pedogenesis or acid leaching, and (v) finally
persistence of poorly crystalline aluminosilicates marking the
end of the warm climate on early mars. the “doublet” type
units described here are likely composed of clay-sulfate
assemblages formed in saline, acidic evaporative
environments similar to those found in western australia and
the atacama desert. despite the chemically extreme and
variable waters present at these terrestrial, saline lake
environments, active ecosystems are present; thus, these
“doublet” type units may mark exciting areas for continued
exploration important to astrobiology on mars.
