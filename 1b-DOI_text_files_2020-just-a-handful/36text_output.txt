4. conclusion

 

this study showed that stable solid lipid nanoparticles (slns)
and nanostructured lipid carriers (nlcs) could both be
successfully produced from candelilla wax. the mean particle
diameter of the lipid nanoparticles in these systems was
below 200nm, which may be useful for many applications.
the lipid phase within the nlcs was solidified by forming an
organogel. the thermal properties and physicochemical
characteristics of the organogel nlcs were characterized.

melting and crystallization peak for the candelilla wax inside

these experiments showed that there was a relatively sharp
melting and crystallization peak for the candelilla wax inside
the nlcs, with crystallization occurring considerably below
melting due to supercooling effects. the viscosity of nlcs
increased as the candelilla wax concentration inside them
increased, which was attributed to the increasing non-
sphericity of the nanoparticles. a simulated gastrointestinal
study of the llcs, nlcs, and slns showed that they all
behaved quite similarly, with aggregation being observed in
the mouth, stomach, and small intestine. finally, a ph-stat
study showed that the digestible lipids (corn oil) in the llns
and nlcs were almost fully digested under simulated small
intestinal conditions. these results may be useful for
designing colloidal delivery systems to protect and release
bioactive components in functional foods.
initially, all three systems contained relatively small mean
particle diameters (130-151 nm) and were strongly negatively
charged (-24 to -47m\). after being mixed with simulated
saliva solution, there was an appreciable increase in particle
size in all the samples, as seen from the light scattering and
microscopy analysis (fig. 6, fig. 8), which may have been due
to the ability of mucin (a large biopolymer) to promote
depletion or bridging flocculation (vingerhoeds, blijdenstein,
zoet, & van aken, 2005). there was an increase in the mean
particle diameter when the different colloidal dispersions

  

depletion or bridging flocculation (vingerhoeds, blijdenstein,
zoet, & van aken, 2005). there was an increase in the mean
particle diameter when the different colloidal dispersions
were incubated in the simulated gastric conditions (fig. 6, fig.
8), which was probably because the surrounding solution
became highly acidic, which reduced the electrostatic
repulsion between the droplets (see later). the particle size
was also relatively large in the small intestine, which was
probably due to the presence of various kinds of colloidal
species in the samples after digestion, such as aggregated
undigested lipid nanoparticles, large vesicles, and calcium
soaps.

there was a large reduction in the magnitude of the negative
charge on the particles in all of the colloidal dispersions after
they were exposed to oral conditions (fig. 7), which may have
been because of the presence of minerals or mucin in the
simulated saliva. the charge on the lipid nanoparticles in all
of the colloidal dispersions was close to zero after they were
exposed to gastric conditions, which is probably because the
highly acidic environment led to some protonation of anionic

st tie cori tis petsions was chose 16 zero aef ey were
exposed to gastric conditions, which is probably because the
highly acidic environment led to some protonation of anionic
groups. asa result, there would have been a reduction in the
electrostatic repulsion between the nanoparticles, which may
account for the nanoparticle aggregation discussed earlier.
the charge was highly negative in all of the samples after
exposure to intestinal conditions, which can be attributed to
the presence of various types of anionic colloidal particles
after digestion, such as undigested nanoparticles, mucin, and
mixed micelles.

 

the gastrointestinal fate of the lns, nlcs and slns was fairly
similar. the mean particle diameters (d32 and dys) of all
samples in the different regions of the git are shown in fig. 6.
initially, the mean particle diameter of the slns was
somewhat lower than that of the llns and nlcs, which may
have been because they were non spherical (section 3.4).
there was a large increase in das but a much smaller increase
in dsp after exposure to the mouth and stomach, which

in dsp after exposure to the mouth and stomach, which
suggests that a limited amount of droplet aggregation
occurred. this effect can be attributed to changes in the
colloidal interactions between the surfactant-coated lipid
droplets, such as bridging, depletion, or electrostatic
interactions caused by the presence of mucin, salts, and acids.
in future studies, it would be useful to elucidate the precise
causes of the droplet aggregation. there were also many large
particles present in the small intestine. the nature of these
particles is likely to depend on the type of lipid nanoparticles
used. the llns were fully digested, the nlcs were partially
digested, and the slns were not digested (see next section).
consequently, one would expect mixed micelles and
insoluble calcium soaps to be present for the llns. in
contrast, one would expect non-digested candelilla wax
nanoparticles to be present for the slns. for the llns, one
would expect a mixture of mixed micelles, insoluble calcium
soaps, and partially digested lipid nanoparticles. in addition,
there may have been some bile salts and aggregated proteins
present in all of the samples.

 

there may have been some bile salts and aggregated proteins
present in all of the samples.

3.6. evaluation of free fatty acid release profiles
of sln, nlc and lln samples

the digestion of the slns, nlcs and llns in the simulated
small intestine was monitored using a ph-stat method. the
volume of 0.1n naoh solution required to neutralize any
ffas released from the samples was measured over time (fig.
9a). the naoh volume remained relatively low at all
digestion times for the slns, which can be attributed to the
fact that they only contained indigestible candelilla wax.
conversely, there was a rapid increase in the naoh volume
titrated into the llns samples during the first five minutes,
followed by a slow increase at longer times, which can be
attributed to digestion of the triglycerides in the corn oil. as
expected, the nlcs gave a profile that was between the llns
and slns because they contained a mixture of digestible and
indigestible lipids. based on the known molecular weight and
masses of corn oil in the different colloidal dispersions, the

 

 

and slns because they contained a mixture of digestible and
indigestible lipids. based on the known molecular weight and
masses of corn oil in the different colloidal dispersions, the
percentage of free fatty acids released was calculated (fig.
98). in both systems containing corn oil (lln and nlc), there
was a rapid increase in ffas released during the first few
minutes followed by a more gradual release later. there was
complete digestion of the lipid phase in both systems, which
suggests that the presence of candelilla wax within the
nanoparticles did not retard lipid digestion. lipase was
unable to hydrolyze the molecules in the candelilla wax,
which accounts for the lack of digestion of the slns in the in
vitro method. a similar behavior has been reported for flavor
oils, which are also resistant to digestion by lipase (zhang et
al,, 2016), the fact that the corn oil in the nlcs was fully
digestible suggests that the presence of the candelilla wax
not inhibit the ability of lipase to contact the
triacylglycerol’s molecules in the systems.

3.4. rheological behavior of candelilla wax based
nlcs

the textural characteristics of colloidal dispersions play an
important role in determining their quality attributes and
functional performance. for this reason, the impact of
candelilla wax concentration on the apparent shear viscosity
of the nlc suspensions was measured. in these experiments,
the total lipid phase concentration was kept constant at 5
w/w% but the ratio of candelilla wax to corn oil inside the
lipid nanoparticles was varied (fig. 4). the viscosity of dilute
colloidal dispersions containing spherical particles is mainly
determined by the disperse phase volume fraction:
n=no(1+2.56), where no is the viscosity of the continuous
phase and @ is the disperse phase volume fraction. candelilla
wax (0.988g/ml) has a higher density than corn oil
(0.928mg/ml) and so the disperse phase volume fraction of

   

phase an phase volu
wax (0.988g/ml) has a higher density than corn oil
(0.928mg/ml) and so the disperse phase volume fraction of
pure wax particles (=0.048) is somewhat higher than that of
pure corn oil particles (6=0.039). this was partly account for
the observed increase in shear viscosity observed as the
candelilla wax concentration increased. however, this effect
would only lead to about a 2% higher viscosity in the llns
than in the slns, whereas we actually observed about a 77%
higher viscosity in the experimental results. this suggests
that some other factor was contributing to the observed
increase in shear viscosity with increasing wax level. we
postulated that the nanoparticles became either non-
spherical and/or more aggregated at his
concentrations, which increased their ability to disturb fluid
flow, thereby increasing the shear viscosity, which is
supported by our tem images (fig. 5).

the particle size distributions of the three types of colloidal
ispersion prepared using pure candelilla wax (slns), pure
corn oil (llns), or a 60:40 mixture (nlcs) were all fairly
similar (fig. 3). the majority of the lipid particles were
between about 40 and 400nm in diameter, with a peak
around 120nm. the main difference was that the slns
contained slightly less larger particles than the nlcs or llns.
the polydispersity index of the slns (0.59+0.03) was slightly
lower than that of the nlcs (0.680.01) and llns
(0,690.00). these results suggest that the particle size
characteristics of the colloidal dispersions used was mainly
determined by the homogenization conditions and emulsifier
type, rather than by the lipid phase composition.

the electrical characteristics of lipid nanoparticles impact
their stability and functional performance, and so the impact
of candelilla wax concentration on their surface potentials
was measured (table 2). the magnitude of the ¢-potential on
the lipid nanoparticles increased as the candelilla wax
concentration was increased, rising from -26 to -47mv when
the wax level was increased from 0 to 100%. all the lipid
nanoparticles were coated with tween 80, which is a non-
ionic surfactant that would not be expected to have a strong
charge (mcclements, 2015). however, studies have shown
that non-ionic surfactant-coated lipid nanoparticles may
have a relatively high negative charge, which may be due to
the presence of free fatty acids or other anionic compounds
in the lipids or surfactants used (‘mcclements, 2011). the fact
that the negative charge increased as the wax concentration
increased may have been because candelilla wax contained
more of these anionic impurities. indeed, the candelilla wax
used in our study was reported to have an acid value of 11-
19mg koh/g, which suggests that it contained anionic fatty
acids.

for each column, data points with different letters are significantly
different from each other (p<0.05).

initially, we compared the thermal behavior of pure
candelilla wax in bulk and emulsified (sln) forms (fig. 2a).
for the bulk wax, a broad melting transition was observed
around 50-75°c when the sample was heated, with a
minimum around 65°c. a number of troughs were observed
during the melting transition, which may be attributed to a
mixture of substances in the wax with different melting
points andjor polymorphic transitions. during cooling, a
broad crystallization transition was observed around 69-
47°c, with a maximum around 60°c. again, a number of
peaks were observed cooling, which corresponded to those
seen during heating, the crystallization temperature range
was therefore slightly less than that of the melting
temperature range, which can be attributed to supercooling

effects, ie,, the free energy barrier associated with creating
liquid area. qualitatively, the candelilla wax slns
exhibited overlapping melting behavior with bulk candelilla
wax, with a broad melting range from around 53 to 67°c, and
a minimum value around 63°c (fig. 2a). however, the
magnitude of the melting transition was much smaller, which
can be attributed to the fact that the slns only contained 5%
candelilla wax. however, the crystallization behavior of the
bulk and sln forms of the wax were quite different. first, the
sln form only exhibited a single peak, whereas the bulk form
exhibited multiple peaks. this effect may have been because
the wax crystallized in a single polymorphic form when the
slns were cooled. second, the crystallization temperature of
the sln form of the wax was considerably lower than that of
the bulk form: the peak crystallization temperature was
around 44°c for the sln form and around 60°c for the bulk
form. this effect can be attributed to the pronounced
supercooling that occurs when li
nanoemulsions (coupland, 2002, gao and mcclements,

2016). in this case, the probability of finding an impurity that

nanoemulsions (coupland, 2002, gao and mcclements,

2016). in this case, the probability of finding an impurity that
can initiate heterogeneous nucleation inside a small lipid
droplet is very small. consequently, homogeneous tends to
occur in small lipid particles, whereas heterogeneous
nucleation tends to occur in bulk lipids (mcclements, 2012).

the thermal behavior of nlc and organogel samples that
both contained a total concentration of 3% candelilla wax was
then compared (fig. 2b). the bulk samples were prepared by
dispersing 3% candelilla wax in corn oil, whereas the nlc
samples were prepared by dispersing 60% candelilla wax in
corn oil and then forming a 5% o
physical form of the wax had a major impact on its thermal
behavior. the bulk organogel exhibited broad melting and
crystallization transitions. in contrast, the organogel slns
exhibited much sharper melting and crystallization peaks,
that were larger in magnitude than for the bulk form. the
observed differences in thermal behavior suggest that the
nature of the crystals formed in the two systems was

ifferent. as mentioned earlier, bulk oils tend to crystallize

observed differences in thermal behavior suggest that the
nature of the crystals formed in the two systems was
different. as mentioned earlier, bulk oils tend to crystallize
via a heterogeneous nucleation mechanism, whereas
emulsified oils tend to crystallize via a homogeneous one
(mcclements, 2012). this is because the chance of finding an
impurity that can promote heterogeneous nucleation
decreases as the particle size decreases.

3.3. influence of wax percentage on particle size
and charge of nlcs

the impact of candelilla wax concentration in the lipid phase
on the characteristics of the particles in the nlc suspensions
was then examined. all samples were prepared by sonicating
pre-warmed aqueous and oil phases using fixed conditions.
the resulting nanoemulsions were then cooled in an ice bath
to crystallize the candelilla wax, brought to room
temperature, and then their particle size and charge were
measured.

the mean narticle diameters (d. 2) of the nics are shown in
temperature, and then their particle size and charge were

measured.

the mean particle diameters (da3) of the nlcs are shown in
table 2 and their particle size distributions are shown in fig.
3. in general, the mean particle diameter was relatively low in
all of the samples (<202nm) but it did depend on lipid phase
composition. interestingly, smaller particles were formed
when the lipid phase was pure candelilla wax (150nm) than
pure corn oil (171nm). the nlcs contained relatively small
nanoparticles (160-172nm) when the lipid phase contained
low candelilla wax levels (1-20%) but larger values (179-
201nm) when it contained high candelilla wax levels (40 or
60%). these results show that lipid phase composition had
some impact on the formation of the nlcs, but that it was not
a major effect. other researchers have reported a similar
effect when formulating other kinds of nlc and sln systems
(saupe et al., 2005, asumadu-mensah et al., 2013).

3.1. gelation properties

initially, we carried out experiments to determine the

generate an organogel in bulk corn oil (fig. 1). these
experiments showed that at least 2 w/w% candelilla wax was
needed to produce a semi-solid structure that did not flow
when the test tubes containing the samples were inverted.
this result is consistent with the results reported by other
authors (toro-vazquez et al., 2007, hwang et al., 2012), who
reported that at least 1-2% and 1% candelilla wax was
required to gel soybean oil and safflower oil, respectively.

initially, simulated gastric fluid stock solution (sgfss) was
prepared by dissolving 2g of nacl and 7ml of hci in distilled
water to reach a final volume of 1 l. this solution was then
stored in a refrigerator. on the day of analysis, 0.064g of
pepsin was added to 20ml of sgfss and the mixture was
stirred for 30min. this sample was then placed in a water
bath at 37°c for 10min. this solution is referred to as
simulated gastric fluid (sgf). the gastric phase digestion was
then started by mixing 20ml of sgf and 20ml of mouth
phase sample, adjusting to ph 2.5, and incubating at 37°c for
2h with continuous swirling at 100rpm.

2.9.3. small intestine phase

at the end of the stomach phase, 30ml of the gastric fluids
were transferred into another beaker. then, pre-prepared
salt, bile salt, and enzyme solutions were sequentially added.
the salt solution was prepared by dissolving 0.055g of
calcium chloride and 0.329¢ of sodium chloride into double
distilled water and stirring until it was dissolved. bile salt
solution was prepared by dissolving 0.1878g bile salt in
phosphate buffer (ph 7) and stirring overnight. enzyme
solution was prepared by dissolving 0.06g lipase in
phosphate buffer (ph 7) and stirring for 30min just before
the initiation of the mouth phase. the beaker containing the
test sample was then submerged in a temperature-controlled
water bath (37°c) and stirred to ensure it was homogeneous.
after the sample had reached 37°c, it was adjusted to ph 7.0
using an automatic titration (ph-stat) instrument (835
titrando, metrohm usa inc., riverview, fl). then, 1.5ml of
salt solution and 3.5ml of bile salt solution were poured into
the beaker, and the sample was adjusted back to ph 7.0.
lastly, the enzyme solution was added. once the lipase was

lastly, the enzyme solution was added. once the lipase was
added into the sample, the volume of 0.1n naoh solution
required to keep the ph at 7.0 was recorded for 2h using the
ph-stat device. the wax used as an organo-gelator was not
digestible by lipase and so it was not taken into account in
the calculations of the amount of free fatty acids released.
the digestion results are presented as the percentage of free
fatty acids released from the digestible fats, as well as the
volume of naoh consumed during digestion. the volume of
naoh consumed during digestion of a blank sample, which
included buffer solution rather than a nlc suspension, was
also recorded and then subtracted from the results of the test
samples.
2.9.1. mouth phase

initially, an artificial saliva work solution (asws) containing
mucin was prepared according to a method described
previously (mao & mcclements, 2012). 20ml of asws and
20ml of nlc suspension were then added to the same flask.
the mixture was then adjusted to ph 6.8 by adding naoh
solution. this mixture was then continuously swirled at a
speed of 100rpm at 37°c for 10min (innova incubator shaker,

the shear viscosity of the lln, nlcs and sln suspensions
were measured at a single shear rate (20s) using a dynamic
rheometer (kinexus rheometer, malvern instruments ltd.,

2.9. simulated gastrointestinal behavior

an in vitro gastrointestinal tract (git) model that included
mouth, stomach and intestinal phases was used to mimic the
passage of the nlcs through the human gut according to the
harmonized infogest method develoned by minelus oral
mouth, stomach and intestinal phases was used to mimic the
passage of the nlcs through the human gut according to the
harmonized infogest method developed by minekus et al.
(2014). each of the phases used in this model was designed to
simulate the conditions of that particular region of the
human gut (such as ph, temperature, agitation, duration, and
composition), as described later. all samples were diluted to a
lipid content of 2wt% using distilled water prior to exposing
them to the git model. after each git stage, microstructure,
particle size, and particle charge measurements were
performed.
2.7.2. transmission electron microscopy

nlcs were prepared for transmission electron microscopy
(tem) analysis by diluting them to a nanoparticle
concentration of 0.05% w/w using deionized water. a small
volume (5p1l) of diluted sample was then deposited onto a
glow-discharged carbon support film (snm thick) on a 400-
mesh copper grid (cf400-cu, electron microscopy sciences,
hatfield, pa). after 30s, any excess sample was blotted off
using filter paper. the grid was then washed with deionized
water and any excess was again blotted off. negative staining
was performed by depositing 5p1l of uranyl acetate solution
(1%, electron microscopy sciences, hatfield, pa) and excess
solution was blotted off after 2min of staining. the grids
were air dried and were then placed in a desiccator for

the electrical characteristics of the particles in the nlcs were
measured using a microelectrophoresis instrument (zetasizer
nano zs, malvern instruments, malvern, uk). before
measurement, 50yl of sample was diluted with 5ml of
double distilled water and then vortexed for 30 sec to ensure
homogeneity. for the samples collected from the simulated
gastrointestinal model, aqueous solutions with ph values
similar to the appropriate gastrointestinal region (mouth,
stomach or small intestine) were used for dilution.

2.7. microstructure analysis
2.2. gel preparation

a series of organogels was prepared by adding different
concentrations (1, 2, 3, 6, 10, 20, 40 and 60 w/w%) of
candelilla wax to corn oil. the resulting mixtures were then
heated to 90°c and stirred for 15min until the candelilla wax
had completely melted. afterward, the samples were moved
to glass containers and cooled down to room temperature,
where they were left lying motionlessly overnight.

2.3. nanoemulsion production

nanoemulsions were produced by sonicating oil and water
phases together using a half-inch horn probe attached to a
high-intensity sonicator (sonic dismembrator, fisher
scientific model 500). the aqueous phase consisted of 2%
tween 80 dispersed in distilled water. this food-grade non-
ionic surfactant was used because it has previously been
shown to be capable of forming small stable lipid droplets (li
& mcclements, 2011). the oil phase consisted of candelilla
wax (1-60%) dispersed in corn oil. control oil phases were

 

shown to be capable of forming small stable lipid droplets (li
& mcclements, 2011). the oil phase consisted of candelilla
wax (1-60%) dispersed in corn oil. control oil phases were
also prepared containing only corn oil (0%) or only candelilla
wax (100%). the oil phase (5 w/w%) and water phase (95 w/w
%) were pre-heated to a temperature above the melting point
of candelilla wax (around 75°c). the aqueous phase and oil
phases were then combined and homogenized for 2min
using a m133/1281-0 high-speed mixer (biospec products,
inc. bartlesville, ok, usa) at 10,000rpm to form a coarse oil-
in-water emulsion. this hot coarse emulsion was then
sonicated (s500w, 60% amplitude, 20khz) for smin, with 3
sec on/3 sec off intervals. during sonication, it was ensured
that the temperature of the nanoemulsion remained above
the melting point of the candelilla wax. as the sonication
process itself promoted extensive heating of the samples, it
was found that an external heat source was not required
during that procedure. after formation, the nanoemulsions
were rapidly cooled to room temperature by placing them
within an ice bath to form nlcs. the particle size and ¢-
potential were then measured.

within an ice bath to form nlcs. the particle size and ¢-

for the sake of brevity, the different types of colloidal
dispersions formed are characterized based on their organo-
gelator concentration in the oil phase: 0% wax=liquid lipid
nanoparticles (llcs); 100% wax=solid lipid nanoparticles
(slns); and, 1-60% wax=nanostructured lipid carriers (nlcs).

2.4. thermal analysis using differential scanning
calorimetry

the melting and crystallization temperatures of bulk
candelilla wax, candelilla wax organogels, and nlcs were
determined using differential scanning calorimetry (q1000,
ta instruments, new castle, de). approximately, 6-10mg of
prepared samples were weighed into aluminum pans and
then hermetically sealed with their lids. a closed empty pan
one was used as a reference. the samples were placed in the
measurement chamber and allowed to equilibrium to the
temperature (20°c). the samples were then heated

from 20 to 100°c at 2°c per minute. after being held at this
temperature for one minute, the samples were then cooled
from 100 to 20°c at 5°c per minute. the dsc enthalpy-
temperature profiles of the samples were recorded
throughout this procedure. the melting and crystallization
temperatures, as well as the enthalpy changes associated
with these transitions, were determined from the heating
and cooling curves using the instrument software.

2.5. particle size measurement

the particle size of the nlcs were measured using a static
light scattering device (beckman coulter ls 12 320, brea, ca,
usa). samples were diluted with double distilled water prior
to analysis to obtain a reliable light scattering signal. results

variety of food components, including proteins,
polysaccharides, phospholipids, and lipids (shishir et al.,
2018, livney, 2015). lipid-based nanoparticles are particularly
suitable as delivery systems for hydrophobi
because they can be manufactured using existing processing
technologies, such as mixers, homogenizers, and sonicators
(fathi, mozafari, & mohebbi, 2012). as a result, this type of
delivery system can be economically produced on a large
scale, which is important for commercial applications.

another advantage of lipid-based nanoparticles formulated
from triglycerides is that they are rapidly digested within the
small intestine leading to the formation of mixed micelles
(mcclements, 2015). asa result, any encapsulated
hydrophobic bioactives are rapidly released from the
based nanoparticles and then solubilized within the mixed
micelles, where they can then be transported to the gut lining
for absorption (mcclements & xiao, 2012).

 

in general, lipid-based delivery systems can be divided into
three main categories: liquid lipid nanoparticles (llns), solid
lipid nanoparticles (slns), and nanostructured lipid carriers
(nlcs) (fathi et al., 2012, kumar, 2019, garcia-pinel et al.,
2019, montes et al., 2019). the nanoparticles in all of these
systems contain hydrophobic domains, which can be used to
entrap hydrophobic bioactives. nevertheless, the physical
state of the hydrophobic interiors of these three types of lipid
nanoparticles varies (akhavan, assadpour, katouzian, & jafari,
2018): completely liquid in llns, completely solid in slns,
and partially solid in nlcs. the main factor impacting the

2018): completely liquid in llns, completely solid in slns,
and partially solid in nlcs. the main factor impacting the
physical state of the interior of lipid nanoparticles is the type
of fats and oils used to fabricate them. in particular, the solid
fat content versus temperature profile of the lipid phase, as
well as the morphology of the crystals formed, determines
the properties of the hydrophobic domains. slns were
originally developed to create a solid lipid matrix around
encapsulated hydrophobic bioactives, with the intention of
better protecting them from their environment and inhibiting
their release (muller, mader, & gohila, 2000). however, it was
found that the highly ordered crystalline structure formed
inside slns can promote expulsion of some hydrophobic
bioactives (qian, decker, xiao, & mcclements, 2013).
moreover, the nanoparticles in slns often adopt highly
irregular shapes after the lipid phase has crystallized,
promoting their aggregation because of the concomitant
increase in oil-water interface (helgason, awad,
kristbergsson, mcclements, & weiss, 2009). these limitations
can be overcome by using nlcs, which contain partially
crystalline lipid phases (fathi et al., 2012, salvi and pawar,

  

kristbergsson, mcclements, & weiss, 2009). these limitations
can be overcome by using nlcs, which contain partially
crystalline lipid phases (fathi et al., 2012, salvi and pawar,
2019). as a result, there are both solid and liquid regions
inside the hydrophobic domains of nlcs, which helps
prevent the expulsion of bioactives and inhibits particle
shape changes.

typically, nlcs are formulated from a mixture solid fat and
liquid oil (ranpise et al., 2014, doktorovova et al., 2014).
however, they can also be created by incorporating organo-
gelators into the oil phase (ghiasi et al., 2019, martin et al.,
2017, palomo et al., 2017, fan et al., 2017). organo-gelators are
hydrophobic substances capable of forming a 3d-network
within the lipid phase, thereby creating solid-like
characteristics (hughes et al., 2009, esposito et al., 2018).
edible natural waxes are commonly used as organo-gelators
in food applications because they are generally recognized as.

compositionally complex lipids whose molecular
composition, physicochemical properties, and functional
attributes depend on their biological origin, as well as
isolation and purification methods (akoh, 2017). candelilla
wax is extracted from candelilla shrubs that grow in the wild
in northern mexico and southwestern texas (co & marangoni,
2012). it is a plant-based edible wax that has gras status for
use as a food additive by the food and drug administration in
the united states. compositionally, it mainly consists of n-
alkanes (about 40-50%), alcohols of penta-cyclic
triterpenoids (about 21-23%), and esters of aliphatic acids
and alcohols (about 6-7.4%) (alvarez-mitre, morales-rueda,
dibildox-alvarado, charo-alonso, & toro-vazquez, 2012).
many of these aliphatic acids (cjg to c34) and aliphatic
alcohols (c4 to c34) are long-chain saturated molecules. due
to the relatively high molecular weight and saturation of
these molecules, candelilla wax has a relatively have high

these molecules, candelilla wax has a relatively have hi
melting point (around 70°c) so that it is solid at room
temperature. when it is mixed with edible oils at sufficiently
high concentrations it forms small crystals that link together
to create a three-dimensional network that traps oil inside
(blake, co, & marangoni, 2014).

  

in our study, we examined the impact of candelilla wax on
the formation, structure, and physicochemical properties of
nlc suspensions, as well as on their potential gastrointestinal

new generation of organogel-based nlcs designed to control
the release of hydrophobic bioactives within the human gut.

abstract

in this study, food-grade nanostructured lipid carriers (nlcs)
were used as delivery systems to overcome some of the
limitations of solid lipid nanoparticles (slns) and liquid lipid
nanoparticles (llns). organogel nlcs were prepared using an
oil phase consisting of a hydrophobic gelator (candelilla wax)
dispersed in liquid corn oil. the oil phase undergoes a gel-to-
sol transition when heated, which means that oil-in-water
nanoemulsions can be used as templates to form the nlcs.
the impact of lipid phase composition on the gastrointestinal
fate of the nlcs was determined using a simulated
gastrointestinal tract (git). the particle size, ¢-potential, and
microstructure of the llns, nlcs and slns were
characterized when they were exposed to model oral, gastric,
and small intestine conditions. the oil phase in the llns and

characterized when they were exposed to model oral, gastric,
and small intestine conditions. the oil phase in the llns and
slns consisted of pure corn oil and pure candelilla wax,
respectively. initially, all samples contained small lipid
particles (d43=150-202nm) with negative surface potentials
((=-26 to -47mv). the llns, slns and nlcs behaved
imilarly in the simulated git in terms of their particle
properties: there was a large increase in particle size and

 

 

decrease in charge magnitude in the mouth, stomach, and
intestine. the candelilla wax in the slns and nlcs was not
igested by lipase, but the corn oil in the llns and nlcs was
fully digested. this phenomenon may be used to create
colloidal delivery systems that can control the release of
encapsulated bioactive agents within the git.
