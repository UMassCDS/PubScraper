multi-omics inference of differential breast cancer-
related transcriptional regulatory network gene hubs
between young black and white patients

2023, cancer genetics

citation excerpt :
...black women have a higher incidence rate prior to 40 years, and a
lower incidence rate after 50 years, relative to white women [6].
‘there is a poorer prognosis in black women relative to white
women 50 years of age or younger and at stage il [7]. the molecular
underpinnings that govern this disparity remains unclear....

transmir is a database of experimentally-validated
transcription factor-microrna regulations (wang et al.,
2009). as micrornas regulate the expression of their target
genes post-transcriptionally, changes in activity of
transcription factors regulating micrornas can have
consequences on the expressions or activities of the genes
regulated by those micrornas. mir- 15a, mir-17, mir- 18a,
mir- 19a, mir-20a, mir-93, mir-106b, mir-141, mir-221, and
mir-429 are among those with increased expression in blacks
relative to whites (fig. 5b). as an example, increased
expression of mir-221, an oncomir that facilitates entry into
the s-phase and promotes the emt (li et al., 2014), is
regulated by myc (which, as noted above, has increased
expression in blacks) (fig. 5b). also, the cell migration and
invasion promoting mirna, mir-135b (zhang et al., 2015), has
increased expression in b/aa compared to caucasian cancer
patients and is regulated by the transcription factors foxm1
and stat3 in our transcriptional regulatory network (figure

patients, while stat3 has decreased expression.

patients, while stat3 has decreased expression.

 

in conclusion, the more aggressive breast cancer biology
reported in b/aa patients likely involves enhanced entry into
the s-phase, and immortalization. a number of likely
molecular participants have been identified here and include
hsf1, tert, hmga1, pqbp1, foxe3, drapi, tafg, ire3,
znf396, creb1, dennd4a, sp1, bdp1, thrb, arid4a, rb1,
and ar. furthermore, the basal-like/tnbc and her2-enriched
molecular subtypes are more common in b/aa patient
samples than in white patient samples. moreover, a number
of genes associated with diminished response to endocrine
therapy (such as sash1, fzd4, kif138, tcf4, ili3ra1, spred1.
cpeb2, epas1, and thes1) have lower expression levels even
among non-responding b/aa patients compared to non-
responding white patients. we observe that prognosis is
poorer in stage ii b/aa patients diagnosed at age 5oyears or
younger. however, enthusiasm is assuaged by the fact that
this observation is based on only three stage i bja and
eleven white patients 5oyears or younger at diagnosis, for

 

 

younger. however, enthusiasm is assuaged by the fact that
this observation is based on only three stage i bja and
eleven white patients 5oyears or younger at diagnosis, for
whom survival data is available. missense mutations in the
e3 ubiquitin ligase gene huwet occur more frequently in
stage ii bja patients 50years old or younger at diagnosis,
and are associated with pten expression loss (which is, itself,
associated with poor prognosis). indeed, the gene expression
profile in this group is distinctly different from that in white
stage ii patients soyears or younger at diagnosis in whom
missense pik3ca mutations occurred more frequently.
several pathways identified here will be examined in future
studies.

2.11. discussion

the results suggest that a major factor in understanding why
breast cancer among b/aa patients tends to be aggressive is
the intrinsic breast cancer subtypes represented. breast
cancer, in reality, has a set of diverse molecular and cellular
presentations and outcomes. the basal-like intrinsic subtype,
in particular, is a more aggressive presentation (alluri and
newman, 2014). her2-enriched breast cancers are also
associated with poor prognoses (brewster et al., 2014). the
intrinsic breast cancer subtype predictor algorithm used in
this study, pamso, has been demonstrated to be a

particularly robust and predictive algorithm (parker et al.,
2009). these results indicate that b/aa patients are more

this study, pamso, has been demonstrated to be a

particularly robust and predictive algorithm (parker et al.,
2009). these results indicate that b/aa patients are more

than two times as likely to harbor the basal-like, and just
about twice as likely as caucasian patients to harbor the
her2-enriched molecular subtype (table 1). the results are
consistent with prior findings showing that the incidence of
triple-negative breast cancers, most of which are basal-like,
high in individuals with african ancestry (afghahi et al., 2016;
bauer et al., 2007).

 

the immortalization gene signature identified by dairkee et
al. (2007) is enriched in b/aa patients (fig. 3) (dairkee et al.,
2007), ie. they are among the most highly expressed (highly
ranked by expression level) genes in samples derived from
b/aa patients. these genes, among which are oxidoreductase
and cell-proliferation pathway genes, have increased
expression upon the transduction of the catalytic subunit of
telomerase (htert). of note, their expression is inversely
correlated with patient survival (dairkee et al., 2007). in line
with this, this key immortalization marker gene, tert, has
correlated with patient survival (dairkee et al., 2007). in line
with this, this key immortalization marker gene, tert, has
increased expression in b/aa patients relative to white
patients (fig. 2a), and is among the leading drivers of the
differences in gene expression between the two phenotypes
(fig. 4). among b/aa patients, the immortalization gene
signature is enriched in tumor samples relative to normal
samples (data not shown).

 

the transition from the typical epithelial phenotype to the
mesenchymal phenotype is associated with an increased
propensity towards metastasis, invasiveness and
aggressiveness (fedele et al., 2017). sarrio et al. (2008)
generated a gene signature associated with the epithelial-
mesenchymal transition (emt) (sarrio et al., 2008).
specifically they showed that the basal-like phenotype,
which has relatively high incidence among b/aa patients in
the tcga data (table 1), was associated with the emt.

as described above, the relative expressions, in b/aa patients,
of rbi, hsa-let-7a, e2f1, c-myc, tert, and others cooperate to

as described above, the relative expressions, in b/aa patients,
of rbi, hsa-let-7a, e2f1, c-myc, tert, and others cooperate to
facilitate entry into the s-phase of the cell cycle (fig. 2d) and,
in part, explains the aggressiveness of cancer in blacks. also
of note, tert and rb1 are differentially expressed
transcriptional factors and master regulators/drivers of
regulons (including differentially expressed targets) within
the transcriptional regulatory network generated (fig. 4).
these help explain the relative aggressiveness of brca in
blacks and are briefly described:

2.11.1. master regulators

a number of top master regulators (ie. differentially active
(between b/aa and white patients) trans
regulators) were identified in this study (fig. 4). among them
is hse1, which has increased expression in brca samples
from baa patients relative to white patients. increased
expression of hsf1 worsens breast cancer by promoting
cancer cell survival and metastasis. hsf1 has a role in

tional

 

 

expression of hsf1 worsens breast cancer by promoting
cancer cell survival and metastasis. hsf1 has a role in
regulating cell stress and heat shock proteins (hsps). of note,
increased hsf1 expression is associated with resistance to
chemotherapeutic drugs, and with the emergence of the
cancer stem cell phenotype (wang et al., 2015). several hsps
like hsp70 and hsp90 have been associated with breast
cancer. hsp70 has been associated with poor tumor
differentiation, increased tumor growth, lack of programmed
cell death (jones et al., 2004), lymph node metastasis as well
as p53 mutations in breast cancer cells (ciocca and
calderwood, 2005). hsp70 has also been linked to increased
era transcriptional activity and growth in mcf-7 breast
cancer cells (spears and barnes, 2003). hsp90 serves as a
shield to her-2/neu and the mutated p53 by preventing the
proteasome from degrading them, which leads to increased
tumor growth in breast cancer (ciocca and calderwood,
2005).

hmgai was also identified as being a master regulator in

b/aa patient brca samples (fig. 4). this affirms the hi
zt fo

   

hmgai was also identified as being a master regulator in
b/aa patient brca samples (fig. 4). this affirms the high
relative incidence of tnbc among b/aa patients as hmga1 is
a known master regulator in tnbc cells (shah et al., 2013)
(table 2). hmga1 directly controls the urokinase
plasminogen activator system whi
pathways in cancer metastasis (resmini et al., 2017). the
urokinase pathway is involved in biological processes such as
inflammation, angiogenesis, remodeling and metastasis,
hence its role in cancer cell migration. there is increasing
evidence that hmga1 plays a role in breast cancer by
inducing emt and metastasis (shah et al., 2013; zhong et al.,
2017), emt is considered to be an essential contributor of the
invasive behavior of tumors during cancer progression
(zhong et al., 2017).

 

one of the hallmark

 

 

also among the master regulators is tert, which has
increased expression in brca samples from baa patients
relative to white patients (fig. 4). one way tert contributes

relative to white patients (fig. 4). one way tert contributes
to cancer cell proliferation is by directly regulating protein
synthesis (khattar et al., 2016). an increase in tert leads to
increased trna expression and this is a mechanism by which
tert contributes to cancer development (khattar et al.,
2016). tert promoter mutations also contribute to tumor
development and have been used as a biomarker for
detection and monitoring of certain cancers (pellatt et al.,
2013). multiple tert single nucleotide polymorphisms
(snps) have been found to be linked directly or inversely to
breast cancer risk because of tert's involvement in the
activation of telomerase (pellatt et al., 2013). the importance
of tert in promoting the proliferative state in breast cancer
was demonstrated by tert crispr/cas9 knockout in mda-
mb-231 cells with resultant inhibition of cell viability and
induction of apoptosis (fig. 5a, b). tert has a positive
reciprocal signaling effect on wnt, which is facilitated by
interaction of tert with the b-catenin-interacting protein
brgi (also referred to as smarcaa). notably, induction of
tert expression in the absence of brg1 failed to stimulate b-

 

interaction of tert with the b-catenin-interacting protein
brgi (also referred to as smarcaa). notably, induction of
tert expression in the absence of brg1 failed to stimulate b-
catenin activity which was restored by upregulating brg1
(park et al., 2009). moreover, myc and its transcriptional
target, tert, are involved in a feed-forward oncogenic
process facilitated via the regulation of degradation and
chromatin stabilization of myc by tert (koh et al., 2015). of
significance is the observation that a marginal decrease in
tert expression resulted in analogous and significant
reduction in the expression of oncoproteins c-myc and
wnti11 in mda-mb-231 and mda-mb-468 cells (fig. 5c-j).
this observation was consistent with studies that highlighted
a co-operative transcriptional relationship between tert and
myc in promoting and sustaining the proliferative state in
tumors (koh et al., 2015; tang et al., 2016).

 
also of note, several of these genes (such as sash, fzd4,
kif138, tcf4, il 13ra1, spred1icpeb2, epas1, and thes1) have
suppressed expression in caucasian non-responders
compared to caucasian responders (figure not shown). as an
example, sash1 is a tumor suppressor whose expression is
linked to breast cancer prognosis (burgess et al., 2016; zeller
et al., 2003), and it is note-worthy that it is suppressed in
non-responding b/aa patients, compared to non-responding
white patients (fig. 8). further muci, which increases
resistance to tamoxifen therapy in estrogen-positive breast
cancer (merikhian et al., 2017), has lower expression in non-
responding b/aa patients, compared to non-responding
white patients (fig. 8).

non-responders include ttn, pik3ca, muci6, and f8.

 

 

2.10.4. bjaa and tnbc

the july 2016 tcga data indicates there is a 56% incidence
rate of tnbc in b/aa patients, compared to 44% in asian
patients, and 29% in caucasian patients (table 2). conversely,
there is a high incidence rate of non-tnbc (71%) in white
patients, compared to 44% in b/aa patients, and 10% in
asians. these observations i.e. that b/aa patients are twice as
likely to present with tnbc than caucasian patients, are
reflected in mutation and gene expression patterns within
those groups.

regarding mutation patterns, there are similarities of
those groups.

regarding mutation patterns, there are similarities of
differential mutations that occur between b/aa and white
patients on the one hand, and tnbc and non-tnbc patients
on the other. pik3ca mutations (mostly missense mutations)
occur more frequently in white stage iii patients (32%) than
in b/aa stage iii patients (20%); they also occur more
frequently in non-tnbc patients (37%), than in tnbc patients
(8%) (fig. 9). at least 75% of all patients with pik3ca
mutations were white and non-tnbc; 9% were b/aa and
non-tnbc. conversely, a variety of tp53 mutations occur
more frequently in stage iii b/aa patients (48%), than in stage
ill white patients (23%); they occur more frequently in tnbc
(73%), than in non-tnbc patients (20%). further among all
patients with tp53 mutations, b/aa patients or tnbc patients
are over-represented. thus, the occurrence of these
frequently mutated genes is a reflection of the high incidence
rates of tnbc among b/aa patients, and high incidence rates
of non-tnbc among white patients (table 2).

2.10.3. response to endocrine therapy

a subset of the expression data was selected for patients who
were on endocrine therapy, identified as re
a combination of the following drugs: tamoxifen, fulvestrant,
anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane, goserelin, or leuprolide.
represented on this list are selective estrogen receptor
modulators (tamoxifen), selective estrogen receptor down-
regulators (fulvestrant), gonadotropin releasing hormone
agonists (goserelin, leuprolide), and aromatase inhibitors
(anastrozole, letrozole, exemestane). patient samples were
grouped according to response status with “responders”
iated with complete response, and “non-responders”
associated with clinical progressive disease or stable disease. of
note, carcinogens such as 2, 3, 7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzodioxin
(tcdd) and benzo(a)pyrene are known to act as ligands to
the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (ahr) and its dimerization
the ahr nuclear receptor (arnt). these two genes

(tcdd) and benzo(a)pyrene are known to act as ligands to
the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (ahr) and its dimerization
partner, the ahr nuclear receptor (arnt). these two genes
were found in our studies to be significantly suppressed
among b/aa patients relative to white/caucasians. thus, this
distinction was probed further.

 

along with the expression data, gene sets associated with
ahr in the molecular signatures database (msigdb) were
used for a gene set enrichment analysis (gsea). a number of
gene sets were enriched in b/aa and caucasian responders
and non-responders. of particular interest are two gene sets
from a study by creighton et al. (2008) in which two mouse
xenograft models of estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer,
one with her2 expansion (“creighton 3”) and another
without her2 expansion (“creighton 5”), acquired resistance
to endocrine therapies. among non-responders, leading edge
creighton 3 and creighton 5 gene set members had
suppressed expression in b/aa patients relative to caucasian
patients (fig. 8). as a collection these genes (captured in fig.
8), which are associated with signaling by interleukins,

circadian clock, regulation of lipid metabolism by ppara,
‘sumoylation of intracellular receptors, foxo-mediated
transcription, regulation of tp53 degradation, etc., are
expressed less in non-responding b/aa patients than in non-
responding caucasian patients.

 
in the subset of patients 5oyears old or younger at diagnosis
with stage ii, the set of master regulators driving the gene
expression differences, as determined using the viper
algorithm (alvarez et al., 2016), overlapped with that
determined across all ages, but also had its unique elements.
in both analyses, pqbp1, hes4, and drap1 were among the
top 20 master regulators with increased expression in b/aa
patients, and creb1, rb1, sp1, arid4a and bdp1 among those

stage ii brca diagnosed at soyears old or younger, taf6l,
patients, and creb1, rb1, sp1, arid4a and bdp1 among those
with suppressed expression. unique to those patients with
stage ii brca diagnosed at soyears old or younger, taf6l,
ddit3, eefid, e4f1, and znf628 were master regulators with
increased expression among b/aa patients, while ddx3x,
ccnt1, rbpj, gabpa, and gtf2a1 had suppressed expression.

 

 

regarding missense mutations, the gene encoding e3
ubiquitin ligase, huwe!, which binds to the brca1 tumor
suppressor and promotes its degradation via the ubiquitin
proteasome pathway (wang et al., 2014), is significantly more
frequently mutated in the b/aaso compared to the wso
group (fig. 7b), and brca1 gene expression is lower in stage ii
b/aa patients. on the other hand, mutations of the pik3ca
gene which are known to counter the poor-prognosis
associated with loss of the tumor suppressor gene pten
(lazaridis et al., 2019), occur significantly more frequently in
the w50 group compared to the b/aaso group. in those
b/aaso patients with huwe1 missense mutations,
expression of the pten gene is severely suppressed compared
to those w50 patients with pik3ca missense mutations
b]aaso patients with huwet missense mutations,
expression of the pten gene is severely suppressed compared
to those w50 patients with pik3ca missense mutations
(supplementary table 3) ie. b/aa5o patients with these
huwel mutations lack the pik3ca mutations which would
otherwise have countered this lack of pten expression.
further, among b/aaso patients with huwe! missense
mutations, master regulators pqbp1, drapi, and taf6l have
higher gene expression, while sp1, arid4a, and ccnt1 have
lower gene expression compared to those w50 patients with
pik3ca missense mutations (supplementary table 3). in
addition, genes encoding upstream mitogen-activated
kinases, the oncogene eras, ras-association domain family
of tumor suppressor proteins rassfi and rassfs, as well as
rasai, and rasef are all dysregulated in b/aaso patients
with huwei missense mutations compared to those w50
patients with pik3ca missense mutations (supplementary
table 3). these findings suggest participatory roles for
huwe! mutations and the pi3 kinase/akt pathways in events
associated with poorer prognosis in younger black breast
cancer patients.

prognosis was decidedly poorer for black/african-american
stage ii breast invasive carcinoma patients diagnosed at age
soyears or younger (b/aaso), compared to white patients of
similar age (w50). survival among the three b/aaso patients
for whom survival data was available was highly significantly
(p<0.001) of shorter duration than those in the eleven w50
patients for whom survival data was available (fig. 7a). in
patients 60 or older at diagnosis, the difference loses its

rna interference of tert using knockout crispr/cas9
plasmid resulted in a significant decrease in mda-mb-231
cell viability (77.39+3.87%) and induction of apoptosis (fig.
5a and b). crispr/cas9-mediated activation and knockout of
tert resulted in a significant upregulation and a marginal
downregulation of tert proteins in mda-mb-231
(148.43+0.54% and 96.98+0.79% respectively) compared to
control (100+3.92%) (fig. 5c and d). tert activation was

(148.43+0.54% and 96.98+0.79% respectively) compared to

concomitant with upregulation of c-myc (139.37£1.21%) and
wnt11 (152.49+4.19%), compared to control (100+1.96% and
100+0.67% respectively). similarly, downregulation of tert
was accompanied by decreased expression of c-myc
(53.11£0184%), and a slight increase in wnt11 expression
(106.60+0.62%) (fig. 5c, e and f). in mda-mb-468 cells, a
marginal activation of tert was achieved (101.56+2.06%),
resulting in a corresponding expression of wnt11
(100.71+1.86%), versus a significant upregulation of c-myc
(149.22+0.54%) (fig. 5g-]). however, significant
downregulation of tert (36.47+ 1.72%) was associated with
corresponding significant decreased expression of c-myc
(17.3420.66%) and wnt (46.02+1.21%).

2104.14. immortalization signature

a set of analyses indicates that genes participating in
pathways associated with proliferation have increased
expression in b/aa patients (fig. 2). notable among these is
the immortalization gene, tert, whose expression is
increased (fig. 2a), and tumor suppressors rb1 and hsa-let-
7a, whose expressions are suppressed in b/aa patients (fig.
2b, c). along with increased expression of e2f1, and proto-
oncogene c-myc in b/aa patients, the differences in gene,
protein, and mir expressions suggests a concerted facilitation
of entry into the cell cycle s-phase in b/aa patients,
compared to caucasian patients (fig. 2d). also, the rppa data
shows processes such as “mitotic g1-g1/s phases”, “s phase”,
“cyclind-associated events in g1”, “g1 phase”, “cyclin
a:cdk2-associated events at s phase entry”, and “cell cycle,
mitotic” are over-represented among proteins

“cyclind-associated events in g1”, “g1 phase”, “cyclin
a:cdk2-associated events at s phase entry”, and “cell cycle,
mitotic” are over-represented among proteins with increased
expression in b/aa patients (supplementary table 1,
supplementary table 2).

moreover, gsea results include an enrichment of an
immortalization gene signature, which includes tert (fig. 3).
using the rna-seq data from 925 white patients, and 189
black patients, at a normalized enrichment score of -1.77 (as
described by (subramanian et al., 2005)), and a nominal p-
value of 0.009, an immortalization gene set (dairkee et al.,
2007) was enriched in b/aa patients in contrast to white
patients. members of this gene set were up-regulated in
breast cancer tumor cultures in which telomerase reverse
transcriptase (tert) expression was induced via a retroviral
vector (dairkee et al., 2007). the leading edge genes for this
gene set as enriched in b/aa patients are ppp2r2d, arhgef9,

plasmids (0.2yg/y1l) were diluted in transfection reagent to a
final volume of 150pl (0.0133 pg/l). transfection reagent
(10pl) was diluted up to 150yl with plasmid transfection
medium and incubated for smin at room temperature (rt).
the plasmid solution was added drop-wise to the
transfection reagent-medium mixture under vortex and
incubated for 30min at rt. cells were refreshed with
antibiotic-free growth media and 18.75yl of plasmid mixture
added drop-wise followed by incubation at 37°c for 24h.
transfection was verified by detection of green fluorescent

the proportion of breast cancer molecular subtypes (i.e.
basal-like, her2-enriched, luminal a, luminal b, or normal-
like) was determined via the pam50 method (fig. 1), using
the rnaseq data and the bioconductor package genefu
(gendoo et al., 2016; parker et al., 2009). the luminal types
like) was determined via the pam50 method (fig. 1), using
the rnaseq data and the bioconductor package genefu
(gendoo et al., 2016; parker et al., 2009). the luminal types
are estrogen receptor- (er-) positive; the her2-enriched type
which has an expanded expression of the human epidermal
growth factor receptor 2; the basal-like types which are
largely triple-negative (i.e. lacking estrogen receptors,
progesterone receptors and her2). the proportion of each
subtype identified in each phenotype was subsequently
computed.

2.7. gsea

subsequently (as shown in fig. 1), a gene set enrichment
analysis (gsea) was performed using rnaseq version 2 data
and curated human gene sets associated with the ahr and
nfe212 in the molecular signatures database, msigdb
(subramanian et al., 2005). both ahr and nfe2l2 have
suppressed expression in black/african-american (b/aa)
patients, relative to white patients. among the phenotypes of
focus were “white” and “b/aa” patients, as well as triple-
negative and non-triple brca samples. the signal to noise
metric was used for ranking genes, and default settings were
used for this analysis. the gene expression compendium
consisting of 5999 genes described above was used.
2.5. protein array data

as shown in fig. 1, reverse phase protein array (rppa) data
derived from 937 samples from the tcga, were processed
using the tcga assembler (mclendon et al., 2008). the
normalized data obtained consisted of proteins associated
with 227 unique antibodies applied to 937 samples, including
165 white patients in stage 3 and 26 black patients in stage 3.
the normalization process involves first subtracting the
median expression value of each protein (across all samples)
from each expression value for the given protein, and then
subtracting the median expression value for each sample
median expression value of each protein (across all samples)
from each expression value for the given protein, and then
subtracting the median expression value for each sample
(across all proteins) from each expression value for the given
sample.

2.6. differential expression

the package, siggenes, was used to identify genes
differentially expressed between the various phenotypes
examined. these include white patients (not hispanic or
latino) and black or african-american (not hispanic or
latino) (schwender et al.). the false discovery rate used for
the rnaseq data was 0.1%; for the rppa data, it was 5%
(benjamini and hochberg, 1995). in the case of the rpa data,
11 proteins (linked with unique antibodies) with at least one
missing expression value from across the 937 samples were
not included in the analysis.

gene expression omnibus, gse47994 », was also analyzed.

gene expression omnibus, gse47994 , was also analyzed.
the arrays were on the affymetrix human genome u219
array platform. the robust multi-array average (rma)
procedure was used for background correction, data
normalization, and log-transformation (irizarry et al., 2003a;
irizarry et al., 2003b). based on associated annotation data,
samples with the triple-negative and non-triple-negative
phenotypes were identified.
2.3. mutation

downloaded brca mutation annotation format text files from
tcga were processed using functions from the maftools
package (mayakonda and koeffler, 2016). differentially
mutated genes i.e. genes with mutations occurring at
different rates between the race- or receptor expression-
based phenotypes of interest, were identified.

 
2.2. mirseq

a transcriptional regulatory network was excerpted from
transmir, a database for transcription factor-microrna
regulations (wang et al., 2009). from tcga (july 2016),
microrna expressed at different levels between b/aa and

 

regulations (wang et al., 2009). from tcga (july 2016),
microrna expressed at different levels between b/aa and
caucasian patients were identified using the siggenes
package (schwender, 2012). the differential microrna
expression data was then superposed on the excerpted
regulatory network.

to download and process the data as described. gene
expression data (rna-seq version 2) were obtained from

assembler. for each sample, six files were generated,
including normalized gene expression values (computed via
the rna-seq by expectation maximization [rsem] algorithm)
(li and dewey, 2011). the normalized count values were
subsequently extracted. ultimately, the resulting gene

african-americans with breast cancer have more aggressive
tumor biology (ihemelandu et al., 2007). hispanic and black
patients tend to have higher tumor sizes and higher mortality
rates than caucasians (patel et al., 2010). compared to
caucasian women from norfolk (united kingdom), black
african patients from jos (nigeria) were found to present
with breast cancer at an earlier age (64 compared to

43.1 years, respectively) (gukas et al., 2006). in a study
comparing breast cancer in black african women from
kinshasa (democratic republic of congo) and caucasian
women from leuven (belgium), black patients tended to have
the more aggressive cancers (i.e. estrogen receptor-negative
and her2/neu-positive) (mvila et al., 2015).

at the molecular level, examples of differences previously
noted include more tp53 mutations and fewer pik3ca
mutations in blacks (keenan et al., 2015). a previous study
using microarrays and reverse phase protein array analysis
(rppa) found no differences in expression in breast cancer
mutations in blacks (keenan et al., 2015). a previous study
using microarrays and reverse phase protein array analysis
(rppa) found no differences in expression in breast cancer
among the racial groups examined (chavez-macgregor et al.,
2014), however, next-generation sequencing technologies
have distinct advantages over microarrays in detecting
transcript abundance; for instance, they are superior in
measuring low-abundance transcripts and detecting the
presence of variants and isoforms (zhao et al., 2014).
furthermore, a study of breast tissues among healthy
european americans and african americans, found
differences in both gene expression and epigenetics (dna
methylation) between the two groups (song et al., 2015).

this work further examines and characterizes the genomic
differences associated with the trait differences already
noted, with a focus on driver genes regulating those
differences. the results from breast invasive carcinoma
(brca) samples presented here are based on next-generation
sequencing technologies (rna-seq version 2 and mirseq) and
protein arrays.

abstract

black/african-american (b/aa) breast cancer patients tend to
have more aggressive tumor biology compared to
white/caucasians. in this study, a variety of breast tumor
molecular expression profiles of patients derived from the
two racial groupings were investigated. breast invasive
carcinoma sample data (rnaseq version 2, reverse phase
protein array, mutation, and mirseq data) from the cancer
genome atlas were examined. the results affirm that b/aa

 

protein array, mutation, and mirseq data) from the cancer
genome atlas were examined. the results affirm that b/aa
patients are more likely than caucasian patients to harbor the
aggressive basal-like or the poor prognosis-associated her2-
enriched molecular subtypes of breast cancer. there is also a
higher incidence of the triple-negative breast cancer (tnbc)
among b/aa patients than the general population, a fact
reflected in the mutation patterns of genes such as pik3ca
and 7p53. furthermore, an immortalization signature gene
set, is enriched in samples from b/aa patients. among stage
ill patients, tert, drap1, and pqbp1, all members of the
immortalization gene signature set, are among master-
regulators with increased activity in b/aa patients. master
regulators driving differences in expression profiles between
the two groups include immortalization markers, senescence
markers, and immune response and redox gene products.
differences in expression, between b/aa and caucasian
patients, of rbi, hsa-let-7a, e2f1, c-myc, tert, and other
biomolecules appear to cooperate to enhance entry into the
s-phase of the cell cycle in b/aa patients. higher expression

 

 

 

    
 

iomolecules appear to cooperate to enhance entry into the
s-phase of the cell cycle in b/aa patients. higher expression
of mir-221, an oncomir that facilitates entry into the cell
cycle s-phase, is regulated by c-myc, which is expressed
more in breast cancer samples from b/aa patients.
furthermore, the cell migration- and invasion-promoting
mirna, mir- 135b, has increased relative expression in b/aa
patients. knock down of the immortalization marker tert
inhibited triple-negative breast cancer cell lines (mda-mb-
231 and mda-mb-468) cell viability and decreased
expression of tert, myc and wnt11. for those patients with
available survival data, prognosis of stage il patients soyears
of age or younger at diagnosis, was distinctly poorer in b/aa
patients. also associated with this subset of b/aa patients are
missense mutations in huwei and pten expression loss.
relative to caucasian non-responders to endocrine therapy,
b/aa non-responders show suppressed expression of a

 

 

 

signature gene set on which biological processes including

signaling by interleukins, circadian clock, regulation of lipid
metabolism by ppara, foxo-mediated transcription, and
regulation of tp53 degradation are over-represented. thus, we
identify molecular expression patterns suggesting
diminished response to oxidative stress, changes in
regulation of tumor suppressors/facilitators, and enhanced
immortalization in b/aa patients are likely important in
defining the more aggressive molecular tumor phenotype
reported in b/aa patients.
