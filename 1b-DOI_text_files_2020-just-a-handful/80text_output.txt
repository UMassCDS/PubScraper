from the cual structure type. interlocking hexagonal networks of b (bi) atoms are
crucial to this structure. (53) these require the shortest b (bi) contact (d}) between
atoms on adjacent antiprism columns to roughly equal the second shortest b (bi)

the upper and lower square faces of each prism. we found that in mobiz at 35.8(5)

electronic structure of mobiz

given the dearth of mo-bi materials and solid-state mo~bi bonds, we turned to
electronic structure calculations to probe the connection between bi-bi distortions in
mobi and its valence electron count. the short bi-bi contacts are readily visualized
in the electron localization function (elf) calculations as discrete dumbbells (figure
4). while these features suggest a charge separated configuration which may be
formally described as mo”*[biz|2~ based on analogous bi zint! compounds, (59) the
absolute elf value suggests little localization relative to an electron gas (elf = 0.5

similar trends of structural distortions with changing electron counts have been
observed in other transition metal-pnictogen systems. in such materials, hoffmann
and co-workers invoked a second-order jahn-teller distortion to explain increased
structural distortion with greater valence electron count. (61) one may expect that as
more valence electrons are added to such structures, there will be a critical point
when the energetic gain for the bonding orbitals through a distortion will be offset by
the filling of antibonding orbitals and an undistorted structure will again be favored

lattice dynamical properties of mobiz

although we concluded that the valence electron count mainly governs the structural
distortions in mobiz, we expected its pressure-dependent properties to be
significantly impacted by steric factors. in particular, we were interested in how the
inclusion of a larger 4d transition metal affected the dynamic stability of the (tm)biz
phase once formed. we therefore performed decompression experiments during
which we collected in situ diffraction patterns as we incrementally decreased
pressure in the dac (figure s7). peaks corresponding to mobiz were observed down
to ~3 gpa. diffraction patterns collected below this pressure contained mgo, mo and
the ambient pressure bi polymorph. while the formation of amorphous materials
could not be ruled out, the observed patterns were indicative of the decomposition of

next, we examined the phonon-band dispersions over a series of pressures between
0-40 gpa (figure 5) to better understand the results of the decompression
experiment and the metastability of mobi, in general. dynamic instability, as seen by
imaginary frequency bands in the phonon spectra, reflects the tendency of a
structure to undergo a vibrationally driven phase change which could provide insight
into the persistence of synthesized phases upon decompression. we found that the

we began by using the ab initio random structure searching (airss) high-throughput
approach (version 0.9.1) to computationally explore high-pressure phase space in
search of stable mo-bi phases for targeted experimental synthesis. (41) airss
integrates with modern density functional theory (dft) packages to allow for the
efficient sampling of potential energy surfaces over vast regions of compositional
space using only a minimal level of sensible biasing of randomly generated
structures (e.g., minimum separation constraints to prevent atomic core overlap,
presence of at least one symmetry element, reasonable starting volumes, etc.)

this procedure requires a careful balance between coverage of

and sufficiently precise calculated energies. our preliminary sez
performed using relatively low cutoff energies and soft pseudopotentials to rapidly
generate a large number of structures that ensures adequate composition sampling
(see the supporting information, si). we ran our first search at 40 gpa, which is near
the upper limit of achievable pressure in the specific diamond anvil cell (dac)
employed in our experiments, generating approximately 10000 relaxed structures
the lowest energy structure was within 25 mev/atom of the elements,
demonstrating the enhanced stability of mo—bi compounds under high pressures
(for reference, in calculations carried out with the same parameters at 0 gpa, the
lowest energy structure had a formation enthalpy of +115 mev/atom).

to gather more accurate energies of the lowest lying structures, and thus better
assess their thermodynamic stability, we performed a second round of higher
accuracy random structure searches. these calculations are detailed in the si and

identity of each layer (a b a’ b' for mobi and a b' a’ b' for mobis) and also leads to a

bi (see figure 1, bottom). the small differences in energy between the most stable
phases at each composition (<20 mev/atom) indicate that we could expect to
access multiple of these related compositions at experimentally relevant
temperatures. the similarities of these predicted phases to each other and to
elemental mo and bi(v) suggest a lack of atomic site preference, which could
manifest experimentally as a bcc substitutional alloy. because these calculations
describe bulk ordered structures (a manifestation of the constrained unit cell size

in addition to these modified bec structures, we found a mobi2 candidate phase at 40

consists of columns of bi square antiprisms with mo chains running through the
center of each column. this structure corresponds to the cual, structure type, one
exhibited by over 200 binary intermetallic compounds, but is distinct from the
elemental structures of either mo or bi. accordingly, this mobiz structure is present in
multiple databases as the result of varied computationally driven material discovery
efforts and is found to have a formation enthalpy of >+300 mev/atom at ambient
conditions. (45,46) more generally, bi does not form materials in this structure type at
ambient conditions but does react with fe above 30 gpa and mn above 8 gpa to
form the analogous febiz and mnbiz structures, respectively. (38,47) similarly, crsba,

to probe how the stabilities of these structures and the overall prase ulagram vary
as a function of pressure, we broadened the computational searches to include
higher and lower pressures. we performed five additional random structure searches
over 0-50 gpa in steps of 10 gpa, a pressure range that fully captures our
experimental capabilities. a summary of the salient structures found across all six
searches is given in table s7. the result of the structure search at 50 gpa was
similar to that carried out at 40 gpa, identifying mobi3 (p4/mmim) as the most stable
predicted structure. although the airss approach identified multiple candidate
structures between 0 and 30 gpa corresponding to local minima on the potential
energy surface and potentially metastable materials, no binary structures were
predicted to be stable relative to the elements(figure s9). this is consistent with the
reported phase diagram for mo~bi, which under ambient pressures demonstrates
immiscibility of the elements up to elevated temperatures corresponding to the
phase change to a mixed gaseous state. (49) we also employed a routine in airss

to target these candidates experimentally, we performed high-pressure experiments
in a dac between 5 and 45 gpa. the transparency of diamond to a wide range of
radiation wavelengths allowed us to simultaneously heat samples with a near-
infrared laser while monitoring their structure with powder x-ray diffraction (pxrd).
we loaded cells with mixtures of elemental mo and bi which had been compressed
into a thin foil. laser-cut discs of single crystal magnesium oxide (mgo) (50) were
used to insulate the sample from the diamonds, as well as serve as a pressure
transmitting medium and the pressure calibrant. (51) all manipulation of samples
was performed under an inert atmosphere to prevent the formation of oxides. prd

the same single phase expressing multiple high intensity peaks. an example of the
diffraction patterns collected while heating in this range is given in figure 2. we
readily indexed these peaks to the /4/mcm space group, and rietveld refinement
confirmed that the new phase was mobiz in the cualz-ype structure (figure 3),

reactivity and miscibility, quantified temperature- and composition-dependent phase
stability, and led to the discovery of thousands of new compounds. (1) although
binary materials are often stoichiometrically simple, generalizable methods for
predicting these structures remain elusive because even small changes in chemical
composition can give rise to a wide variety of structures. (2), in-depth analysis of
known structures has revealed trends in electronic and steric requirements for
specific structure types. (3-10) however, the occurrence of ‘empty’ phase space
