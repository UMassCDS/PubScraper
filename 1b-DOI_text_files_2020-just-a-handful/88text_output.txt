conclusion

our study shows that senescence of individual flowers and senescence of
the plant both result in the breakdown of si and the formation of self-
fertilized seeds, affecting the purity of hybrid seeds in chinese cabbage and
in radish, and probably also other cruciferous family plants. results show that
age-dependent senescence upregulates ethylene, induces the expression of
senescence-associated genes, and causes pcd in stigmatic papilla cells,
which are closely associated with the breakdown of si. our findings are
insightful to further reveal the mechanism underlying senescence-associated
si breakdown, also set the foundation for the prediction of si under other
unfavorable conditions, such as energy deprivation, drought, salinity,
wounding, or various pathogen attacks. knowledge produced here might
help develop strategies to mitigate the impact of these unfavorable
conditions on producing f1 hybrid. our findings also led to the development
of ethephon spray as a new strategy in overcoming si for parental line
propagation.
our findings that senescence-associated pcd demonstrated here and
compatible pollination-induced pcd (sankaranarayanan et al., 2013; su et
al,, 2020) share similar functions and a common regulatory mechanism
represent an important step forward for our understanding of stigmatic
control of pollen germination, tube growth, and penetration. we establish
that pcd in stigmatic papilla cells is essential and sufficient for pollen tube
growth and penetration in senescent stigmas and in compatible pollination
(figures 2~4; su et al., 2020). for example, the percentage of pl-stained
nuclei increased from 5% in 0 dae stigmas to 60% in 3 dae stigmas (figures

3a,b and supplementary figure 28), similar to the level of cell death in
yiowu an pencuauu!! 1h scheolcht suyhias aru hy cupauue pul aut

(figures 2~4; su et al., 2020). for example, the percentage of pl-stained
nuclei increased from 5% in 0 dae stigmas to 60% in 3 dae stigmas (figures
3a,b and supplementary figure 28), similar to the level of cell death in
stigmas at 30 min after cross-pollination when compatible pollen starts to
germinate (su et al,, 2020; supplementary figure 2a). since pl is not
permeant to live cells, pl-stained nuclei reflect the permeability of plasma
membrane and indicate the leak of water and other factors out of the papilla
cells. our finding that stigmas of senescent flowers or senescent plants have
pl-stained nuclei in the papilla cells before pollination, mimicking the effect
of cross-pollination, suggests that papilla cells with porous plasma
membrane cannot seal water and other factors inside; therefore, they are
capable of supporting the germination and tube growth of either self-pollen
or cross-pollen. pcd in compatible pollination and in senescent stigmas also
share regulatory components. we demonstrate that they are both regulated
by brsagi2, brsag29, and brore1 (figure 4) and that stigma senescence is
dependent on ethylene signaling (figures 5c-f). for example, ethephon-
released ethylene induces the expression of brsags and brore1 while
suppressing ethylene response by as-brerf012.1 downregulates the
expression of brsags and brore1 (figure 5f). in su et al. (2020), we
demonstrated that suppressing pcd by the caspase-inhibitor, z-vad-fmk, or
suppressing the expression of regulatory genes of papilla cell pcd effectively
inhibits compatible pollination, whereas inducing pcd by treating stigmas
with ethephon effectively breaks down si and supports the germination and
growth of self-pollen. taken together, our findings reported here and in su

inhibits compatible pollination, whereas inducing pcd by treating stigmas
with ethephon effectively breaks down si and supports the germination and
growth of self-pollen. taken together, our findings reported here and in su
et al. (2020) suggest that stigmatic papilla cell pcd, triggered by cross-
pollination or by senescence, probably facilitate pollen hydration and
germination by secreting water and other factors out of the damaged papilla
cells. the lack of papilla cell pcd after self-pollination indicates that papilla
cells reject self-pollen by preventing an ethylene-mediated pcd process (su
et al,, 2020). it will be interesting to investigate in the future how self-pollen
and cross-pollen selectively modify ethylene-mediated pcd to achieve the
sl and sc response

in a broader context, ethylene and pcd are often found involved in biotic or
abiotic stresses (hinz et al., 2010; huysmans et al., 2017; nascimento et al.,
2018; xiao et al., 2020; noman et al., 2020). these environmental stresses
such as high salinity, low light intensity, drought, pathogen attack, and
nutrient deficiency promote premature senescence (balazadeh et al., 2010;
zhao et al., 2016; gao et al., 2018; suzuki and katano, 2018; aacute et al.,
2020; hu et al., 2020; tian et al., 2020). therefore, these environmental
stresses may cause the upregulation of ethylene signaling and the induction
of pcd in papilla cells and are likely to reduce or completely break down si
in many brassica family plants

the ability to compromise or fully break down si under unfavorable
conditions such as senescence is vital from the perspective of the plants. for
in many brassica family plants

the ability to compromise or fully break down si under unfavorable
conditions such as senescence is vital from the perspective of the plants. for
many brassica family plants, outcrossing is preferred for the fitness of the
progenies and selfing can result in inbreeding depression. over a season,
plant condition, pollinator availability, and environmental factors vary. when
flowers have wasted more than one day waiting for outcrossing or plants
have passed their full-bloom stage, it would seem strategically sensible for
senescent flowers or senescent plants to opt for releasing the inhibition on
self-pollen and produce some self-fertilized seeds rather than keeping
stringent si and producing no seed at all. furthermore, since plants are
sessile and have to survive unfavorable conditions during growth and
reproductive processes, it makes perfect sense that healthy and strong plants
have robust si to favor outcrossing while weak or stressed plants would relax
the control on si to ensure some level of self-propagation. the fact that
ethylene and pcd are often found associated with senescence and
unfavorable conditions also enables plants to co-opt these pathways to
balance si and sc accordingly.

our finding that ethylene-regulated pcd is associated with senescence-
induced si breakdown is an important advance for the horticultural breeding
research and fi hybrid seed production. many of the brassica family plants
are widely cultivated and consumed all over the world; our study of chinese
cabbage and radish therefore has a broad range of applications. from the

persnective of nlant breedina senescence-associated breakdown of si
research and fi hybrid seed production. many of the brassica family plants

are widely cultivated and consumed all over the world; our study of chinese
cabbage and radish therefore has a broad range of applications. from the
perspective of plant breeding, senescence-associated breakdown of si
reduces the purity of hybrid seeds and is better to be avoided or kept as low
as possible. understanding the mechanism of senescence-associated
breakdown of si might generate new approaches to eliminate self-fertilized
seeds and to improve hybrid purity, such as boosting the overall health of the
plants to delay the senescence process.

the breakdown of si is equally important in the breeding industry because
the propagation of si inbred lines is the foundation for hybrid seed
production. in practice, delayed pollination, i.e., pollination carried out on
senescent stigmas, is utilized to overcome si for the propagation of si
parental lines. our finding that pcd is associated with senescence-induced
si breakdown explains the utilization of delayed pollination. based on our
finding that ethylene induces senescence-associated genes in stigmatic
papilla cells (figure 5 and supplementary figure 5; su et al., 2020), we
demonstrated that spraying 3-12 mm ethephon on the inflorescences of
heading chinese cabbage (su et al., 2020), flowering chinese cabbage
(figures 8a-f) and radish (figures 8g-l), all significantly promoted the
formation of self-fertilized seeds. although the optimum concentration of
ethephon need to be tested in different crops, ethephon spray has the
potential to be implemented in the breakdown of si in many cruciferous
family crops (figure 8 and supplementary figure 9).

discussion

pollen—stigma interaction is the first checkpoint in fertilization to facilitate
the germination and penetration of compatible pollen and the rejection of si
pollen or unrelated foreign pollen (jany et al., 2019). for many si plants,
outcrossing introduces genetic diversity but self-fertilization ensures the
production of progeny generations. the regulation of these two seemingly
antagonistic but important processes is crucial for plant survival and for the
breeding industry. it has been suggested that senescent stigmas have much
weakened si in transformed si arabidopsis col-0 plants (nasrallah et al.,
2002, 2004; tantikanjana and nasrallah, 2012). however, how senescence
affects the hybrid seed production and the propagation of si parental lines
had remained poorly understood. therefore, it is important to uncover the
molecular mechanism on how senescence affects si at the level of the
stigma as the earliest interface for pollination. here, as summarized in figure
9, pcd in the papilla cells of senescent stigmas in chinese cabbage and in
radish, is associated with the breakdown of si and the formation of self-
fertilized seeds

spraying ethephon promotes the formation of self-fertilized seeds in
flowering chinese cabbage and radish

the ethylene-releasing reagent, ethephon, is widely used to promote
ripening of many fruits (ampa et al., 2017) or to increase the percentage of
female flowers in cucumis family vegetables (hao et al., 2003; duan et al.,
2008; wang et al., 2010). we showed previously that spraying ethephon
overcomes si in heading chinese cabbage (su et al., 2020). considering the
similarity between radish and chinese cabbage in pcd and the breakdown of
slin senescent flowers and senescent plants, we hypothesize that spraying

overcomes si in heading chinese cabbage (su et al., 2020). considering the
similarity between radish and chinese cabbage in pcd and the breakdown of
slin senescent flowers and senescent plants, we hypothesize that spraying
ethephon overcomes si and promotes the formation of self-fertilized seeds
in flowering chinese cabbage and s| radish. to test our hypothesis, we
sprayed the inflorescences of flowering chinese cabbage plants and
inflorescences of radish plants with different concentrations of ethephon,
pollinated with self-pollen, and observed the number of self-pollen tubes
that penetrated the stigma at 6 hap. results showed that flowering chinese
cabbage stigmas and radish stigmas from the ethephon-sprayed
inflorescences allowed the penetration of bundles of self-pollen tubes
(figures 8a,b,g,h), whereas no self-pollen tubes penetrated stigmas from
mock-sprayed inflorescences (figures 8a,b,g,h). to observe the effect of
spraying ethephon on the formation of self-fertilized seeds in flowering
chinese cabbage and in radish plants, the ethephon-sprayed inflorescences
were pollinated with self-pollen and the pods were observed at 15 dap for
radish and at 20 dap for flowering chinese cabbage. as shown in figure 8,
the pods from ethephon-sprayed inflorescences of flowering chinese
cabbage plants and of radish plants both were significantly longer (figures
8c,d,i,j) and had many more seeds per pod (figures 8e,f,k,l) than those
from mock-treated inflorescences. for example, inflorescences sprayed with
3 mm ethephon produced ~15 seeds per pod in flowering chinese cabbage
and ~7 seeds per pod in radish, whereas mock-treated inflorescences
produced no seeds in these two strong si plants (figures 8e,f.k,l).

furthermore. we examined if spravina ethephon affects the viabilitv of seeds
3 mm ethephon produced ~15 seeds per pod in flowering chinese cabbage

and ~7 seeds per pod in radish, whereas mock-treated inflorescences
produced no seeds in these two strong si plants (figures 8e,f.k,l).
furthermore, we examined if spraying ethephon affects the viability of seeds
seeds from ethephon-sprayed radish plants were germinated and the
germination rate was compared with seeds from bud pollination, i.e.,
pollination carried out on the stigmas at their bud stages when si system is
not active. results showed that the germination rate of seeds from
ethephon-sprayed plants was close to 100%, as good as that of seeds from
bud pollination (supplementary figure 9). together, our results suggest that
spraying ethephon overcomes si and promotes the formation of self-
fertilized seeds in flowering chinese cabbage and radish

we next investigated if pcd is also involved in senescence-associated
breakdown of si in radish. consistent with our findings in senescent chinese
cabbage flowers (figures 3, 4), senescent radish flowers showed increasingly
higher percentage of dead papilla cells with the progress of senescence,
indicated by pl-stained nuclei (figures 7a,b and supplementary figure 8a)
for example, ~40% dead papilla cells were found in 3 dae stigmas whereas
~0% was found in 0 dae stigmas (figures 7a,b). furthermore, self-
pollination aggravated the severity of pcd; for example, the percentage of
dead papilla cells were increased from 40% to 55% after self-pollination
(figures 7a,b). similarly, 0 dae stigmas from old plants showed ~40% dead
papilla cells whereas that from young plants had very low level of papilla cell
death (figure 7c and supplementary figure 8b). similarly, dead papilla cells
indicated as fda-negative were progressively increasing in 0-6 dae stigmas
of radish plants (supplementary figures 8c,d). taken together, these
findings show that senescence-induced pcd may underlie the si breakdown
in chinese cabbage and in radish

response in 0-4 dae stigmas of chinese cabbage. constitutive triple
response 1 (ctr) and ethylene response factors (erfs) in a. thaliana play a
negative and a positive regulatory role in ethylene signaling pathway,
respectively (dubois et al. 2018; binder, 2020; su et al., 2020). among the
brctr1 and brerfs that we analyzed (supplementary figure 5c), the
expression of brctr1 was suppressed or totally abrogated in senescent
stigmas (figure 5c), and the expression of brerfs, such as brerfo12.1,
brerf109, brerfo17, and brerfo12.2, was upregulated (figure 5d). these
results are in line with our previous findings that as-brctr1 treatment
induces papilla cell pcd and the breakdown of si and that as-erfo12.1
treatment suppresses papilla cell pcd and the growth of compatible pollen
(su et al., 2020).

 

to further investigate the involvement of ethylene in flower senescence in
chinese cabbage, we tested whether increasing ethylene in 0 dae stigmas
affects the expression of brore1 and brsags. as shown in figure 5e, the
expression of brctr1 was significantly suppressed and brerfo12.1 was
significantly induced in ethephon-treated stigmas. more importantly, the
expression of brore1, brsag12, and brsag29 was drastically upregulated in
ethephon-treated stigmas (figure 5£). we also examined whether blocking
ethylene response by suppressing brerfo12.1 affects the expression of these
genes. results showed that the transcripts of brore1, brsag29, and brsag12
were greatly reduced in unpollinated 0 dae stigmas treated with as-
brerfo12.1 than that in mock-treated stigmas (figure 5f). together, these

results are consistent with ethylene being an important component in cross-
genes. results showed that the transcripts of broke1, brsagzy, and brsag1z

were greatly reduced in unpollinated 0 dae stigmas treated with as-
brerfo12.1 than that in mock-treated stigmas (figure 5f). together, these
results are consistent with ethylene being an important component in cross-
pollination-triggered pcd and senescence-associated pcd in papilla cells.

papilla cell pcd is associated with senescence-induced si breakdown in
radish

radish belongs to the genus raphanus, but its si is similarly controlled as in
the brassica plant chinese cabbage and also uses si for hybrid seed
production. we therefore examined if the strength of si in radish is also
affected by senescence and whether pcd is involved

to test the effect of senescence on the strength of si in radish, we staged
radish flowers based on the days after anthesis, similar to chinese cabbage
flowers. control radish flowers were marked at 0 d, remained not
emasculated, and grew for another 0-4 days to correlate with the natural
senescent stages (supplementary figure 7a). for experiments, 0-d flowers
were emasculated, waited for 0-4 days (0-4 dae), and then pollinated with
self-pollen grains. as shown in figures 6a,b, 0 dae stigmas had no self-
pollen tubes penetrated, whereas increasingly more self-pollen tubes
penetrated 2-3 dae stigmas. consequently, 2-3 dae pistils showed longer
pod and more seeds per pod than 0 dae pistils at 12 dap (figures 6c-f). we
also found that 4 dae stigmas have fewer self-pollen tubes and the pods

were shorter and produced fewer self-fertilized seeds (figures 6a—f),
penetrated 2-5 dae stigmas. consequently, 2-5 dat pistils snowed longer

pod and more seeds per pod than 0 dae pistils at 12 dap (figures 6c-f). we
also found that 4 dae stigmas have fewer self-pollen tubes and the pods
were shorter and produced fewer self-fertilized seeds (figures 6a-f),
probably due to senescence-caused decrease in stigma receptivity. similarly,
0 dae stigmas from old plants allowed the penetration of more than 30 self-
pollen tubes (figures 6g,h), the pods were longer, and seeds per pod were
more than that from young plants (figures 6!-l). these results together
suggest that senescence compromised the strength of si in radish

we aimed to study the function of brsag29, brsag12, and brore1in papilla
cell death, but an efficient transformation protocol for heading chinese
cabbage is not available. antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotide (as-odn) has
been shown to function as a powerful tool to suppress genes in in vitro
grown pollen tubes (liao et al,, 2013; mizuta and higashiyama, 2014; chai et
al,, 2017; chen et al., 2018) and in the stigma feeding assay that we
developed to manipulate the stigma environment and examine the effect on
pollen germination and penetration (duan et al., 2014; su et al., 2020). we
therefore used as-odn to examine if suppressing the expression of
brsag29 or brore1 would affect the growth and penetration of compatible
pollen tubes in 0 dae stigmas. as shown in figures 4c.e, the abundance of

brsag29 transcript and brorel transcript was significantly reduced in

brsag29 or brore1 would affect the growth and penetration of compatible
pollen tubes in 0 dae stigmas. as shown in figures 4c.e, the abundance of
brsag29 transcript and brore1 transcript was significantly reduced in
stigmas treated with the corresponding as-odn than that in mock-treated
stigmas. cross-pollination triggered 80-90% of papilla cell death in stigmas
pretreated with s-brsag29 or s-brore1 and in mock-treated stigmas
(figures 4d,f). however cross-pollination-triggered papilla cell death
occurred only ~10% in stigmas pretreated with as-brsag29 or as-brore1
(figures 4d,f). meanwhile, the growth and penetration of cross-pollen tubes
were significantly inhibited in stigmas pretreated with as-brsag29 or as-
brore1, which were both only ~1/4 of that in mock-treated stigmas or
stigmas pretreated with s-brsag29 or s-brorei (figures 4g,h). these
results suggest that brsag29 and brore1 are essential for papilla cell pcd
and compatibility responses.

to explore whether brsags are regulated by brorel in papilla cell death,
similar to that in the senescence of arabidopsis leaf or flower (wagstaff et al.,
2009), we treated 0 dae stigmas with as-brore1 and detected the
expression of brsags. results showed that not only brore1 but also
brsag29 and brsag12 were significantly suppressed (figure 4), suggesting
that brore1 functions upstream of brsag29 and brsagi2 in regulating the
senescence of stigma. altogether, these results suggest that senescence
upregulates the bore! transcription factor, promotes the expression of
brsags such as brsag29 and brsagiz, and triggers pcd in papilla cells of

senescence of stigma. altogether, these results suggest that senescence
upregulates the bore! transcription factor, promotes the expression of
brsags such as brsag29 and brsagiz, and triggers pcd in papilla cells of
senescent stigmas or stigmas of young flowers from senescent plants.

ethylene is involved in the senescence of chinese cabbage stigmas

we previously reported that ethylene response is upregulated in cross-
pollinated stigmas and ethylene promotes pcd in papilla cells and breaks
down si in chinese cabbage (su et al., 2020). we also found in this study that
stigma senescence was regulated by brore1 (figure 41), which is a known
transcription factor downstream of ethylene signaling in leaf senescence
(kim et al., 2009, 2014). these results prompted us to test whether
senescence-associated pcd in the papilla cells is regulated by ethylene.

we first analyzed the expression pattern of genes involved in ethylene
biosynthesis in 0-4 dae stigmas of chinese cabbage. the rate-limiting
factor in ethylene production is considered to be the synthesis of 1-
aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (acc), the immediate precursor of
ethylene (yamagami et al., 2003; lee and yoon, 2018; marczak et al., 2020)
genes in b. rapa were named based on their homologs in a. thaliana. among
the acc synthase genes in b. rapa (bracss) that we analyzed
(supplementary figures 64,8), bracs6, bracs9.2, bracs10, and bracs12
were greatly upregulated in senescent stigmas (figure 5a). these four bracs
genes were also upregulated in cross-pollinated stigmas, but their
exnrecsion remained law in uinnallinated stinmas and in self-nollinated

(supplementary figures 64,8), bracs6, bracs9.2, bracs10, and bracs12
were greatly upregulated in senescent stigmas (figure 5a). these four bracs
genes were also upregulated in cross-pollinated stigmas, but their
expression remained low in unpollinated stigmas and in self-pollinated
stigmas (figure 5b).

the change of nucleus is another hallmark of pcd that reflects the progress
of pcd. we therefore observed the shape change of nucleus among the pl-
stained nuclei in 1-6 dae stigmas, to prove that pcd in the papilla cells of
senescent stigmas is an irreversible process. in 1 dae stigmas, which is at the
early stage of pcd, the pl-stained nuclei were usually round (figure 3a). with
the progress of senescence, the nuclei became irregular, presented a bar-
like shape in 2-4 dae stigmas, and became crescent-shaped and distorted
in 5-6 dae stigmas (figure 3a). we then quantified the change of nucleus by
measuring the area, or calculating the ratio of length/width of each pi-
stained nucleus in 1-6 dae stigmas. supplementary figures 3d—f showed
that from 1 dae to 6 dae stigmas, the nucleus became smaller and
slenderer, especially in 5-6 dae stigmas, suggesting that the nucleus
damage become more serious with the progress of senescence. in addition,
the number of pl-stained nucleus was reduced in 5 dae (p< 0.05) and 6 dae
(p< 0.0001) stigmas compared to that in 4 dae stigmas (figure 38),
suggesting that the degradation of nucleus occurred in 5 dae and 6 dae
stigmas. altogether, our results demonstrated that pcd in the papilla cells of
0-6 dae stigmas was an irreversible process.

the finding that papilla cells with pl-stained nucleus were still capable to
support pollen tube growth led us to use the viability probe, fluorescein
diacetate (fda), to test the viability of the cells in 0-6 dae stigmas. fda is a
cell-permeant esterase substrate that requires intracellular esterases to

activate its fluorescence and also reauires cell-membrane intearity for
support pollen tube growth led us to use the viability probe, fiuorescein

diacetate (fda), to test the viability of the cells in 0-6 dae stigmas. fda is a
cell-permeant esterase substrate that requires intracellular esterases to
activate its fluorescence and also requires cell- membrane integrity for
cellular retention. we found that the number of fda-negative papilla cells
was progressively increasing in 0-6 dae stigmas (supplementary figures
3b,c), which is not exactly the same compared to the change of cells with
pl-stained nucleus (figures 34,8). for example, the number of fda-negative
cells increased from 0% in 0-1 dae stigmas to < 10% in 2-3 dae stigmas
and further increased to 20-55% in 4-6 dae stigmas (supplementary
figures 38,c), whereas the number of cells with pl-stained nucleus increased
from 0% in 0 dae stigmas to 40-60% in 2-4 dae stigmas but decreased to
60-40% in 5-6 dae stigmas (figure 38). although the stigmas were not
dual-stained with pi and fda and individual cells were not observed by time-
course confocal microscopy, the p| pattern and fda pattern in 0-6 dae
stigmas suggest that many of the papilla cells in 1-3 dae stigmas showed
both cytoplasmic fluorescein and nuclear pi. this result is similar to rice blast
invasion-caused damage to the host cells, in which both fda and pl are
positive in newly invaded cells but fully invaded cells only have pl-positive
nucleus (jones et al., 2016). we speculate at this stage of senescence, such
as 0-3 dae stigmas, that some papilla cells were in the process of cellular
dismantling with the loss of membrane integrity, gradually allowing both pi
to enter and fluorescein to diffuse out. this also explains our result that 1-3
dae stigmas with pl-stained nucleus still support pollen tube growth

however, with the progress of senescence such as in 4~6 dae stigmas, the
aismantung with the loss of membrane integrity, gradually allowing both fi

to enter and fluorescein to diffuse out. this also explains our result that 1-3
dae stigmas with pl-stained nucleus still support pollen tube growth
however, with the progress of senescence such as in 4~6 dae stigmas, the
papilla cells may become more porous and lost cellular retention of fda as
well as the receptivity to support pollen germination and growth. these
results provided rational explanations for the reduced number of self- or
cross-pollen tubes in 4-6 dae stigmas than that in 3 dae stigmas (figures
1b,c) and for the reduced number of self-fertilized seeds in 4 dae pistils than
that in 2-3 dae pistils (figure 1e). altogether, our results suggest that the
progress of pcd in senescent stigmas is an irreversible process, from the
compromise of plasma membrane integrity in 1-3 dae stigmas to deformed
nucleus in 4-6 dae stigmas.

furthermore, we found that self-pollination triggered more papilla cell death
in senescent stigmas (figures 3a,b and supplementary figure 2b). for
example, the percentage of dead papilla cells in unpollinated 1 dae and 2
dae stigmas was ~25% and ~40%, respectively, but the percentage
increased to ~52% and ~90% after self-pollination (figure 38). it was likely
that some of the papilla cells of the unpollinated senescent stigmas did not
show pl-stained nuclei, but the strength of si was already compromised;
therefore, self-pollination triggered more pcd in these senescent stigmas
(figure 3b), consistent with compatible pollination-triggered pcd in papilla
cells (su et al., 2020, also shown in supplementary figure 2a).

similarly, we compared the percentage of papilla cell death in 0 dae stiamas
(figure 3b), consistent with compatible pollination-triggered pcd in papilla
cells (su et al., 2020, also shown in supplementary figure 2a).

similarly, we compared the percentage of papilla cell death in 0 dae stigmas
from young and old plants in three varieties of si chinese cabbage. the
percentage of dead papilla cells, indicated by pl-stained nuclei, was
significantly higher in unpollinated 0 dae stigmas from old plants than that
from young plants in all three varieties of chinese cabbage plants, and self-
pollination further promoted cell death (figures 3c,d and supplementary
figures 2c-e). together, these results suggest that senescence mimics the
effect of cross-pollen (su et al., 2020) in causing pcd in stigmatic papilla
cells and therefore breaks down si in senescent flowers and young flowers
from senescent plants before pollination

senescence-associated genes are required for papilla cell pcd

to investigate whether the breakdown of si in senescent stigmas is simply
due to age-dependent reduction of srk expression or senescence-
associated pcd in the papilla cells, we first examined the expression level of
srk in 0-4 dae stigmas. as shown in supplementary figure 4, the level of
srk transcripts in 1 dae stigmas was not different from that in 0 dae
stigmas, but it declined to ~60% in 2 dae stigmas and only ~10% in 3 dae
stigmas and 4 dae stigmas. however, the breakdown of si started to occur
in 1 dae stigmas (figures 1b,c), which is before the reduction of srk
expression. our result is consistent with the report that in older brassica
eee eee poe ed eer ee
stigmas and 4 dae stigmas. however, the breakdown of si started to occur
in 1 dae stigmas (figures 1b,c), which is before the reduction of srk
expression. our result is consistent with the report that in older brassica
flowers, srk transcript and protein level decline, but they usually remain
above the threshold required for maintenance of the si response (nasrallah
et al,, 2002). however, 1 dae stigmas had ~20% pl-positive papilla cells, and
allowed the growth of ~10 self-pollen tubes. altogether, the results that the
breakdown of si and pcd both occurred in 1 dae stigmas suggest that
papilla cell pcd is closely correlated to the breakdown of si in senescent
stigmas.

we therefore studied how pcd is regulated in senescent stigmas and
whether disturbing these regulators affect pollen-stigma interactions
among the senescence-related genes we analyzed (supplementary figures
5a,b), brsag29, brsag12, and brore1 were upregulated in unpollinated
senescent stigmas (figure 4a). interestingly, the expression of these genes
was also significantly (p< 0.01) higher in cross-pollinated stigmas than that
in self-pollinated stigmas (figure 48), suggesting that senescence-associated
pcd and cross-pollination-triggered pcd are likely to be regulated similarly
by these genes.
the change of nucleus is another hallmark of pcd that reflects the progress
of pcd. we therefore observed the shape change of nucleus among the pi-

to examine whether flower senescence has any impact on the strength of si,
we pollinated the 0-6 dae stigmas from young chinese cabbage plants with
self- or cross-pollen grains and counted the number of pollen tubes that

had penetrated the stigma. we found that cross-pollinated 0-4 dae stigmas
were penetrated by comparable number of pollen tubes, suggesting that the

stage difference in 0-4 dae stiamas does not cause obvious difference in
self- or cross-pollen grains and counted the number of pollen tubes that

had penetrated the stigma. we found that cross-pollinated 0-4 dae stigmas
were penetrated by comparable number of pollen tubes, suggesting that the
stage difference in 0-4 dae stigmas does not cause obvious difference in
receiving compatible pollen tubes (figures 1b,c). in the case of self-
pollination, no self-pollen tubes grew or penetrated the 0 dae stigmas,
whereas significantly more self-pollen tube penetration of 1 dae stigmas
was already observed, and with the progress of senescence, the increase of
self-pollen tubes became progressively more dramatic in the 2-4 dae
stigmas (figures 18,c). for example, ~18, 60, and 100 self-pollen tubes
penetrated the 1, 2, and 3 dae stigmas (figures 18,c). these results suggest
that si was stringent in 0 dae stigmas for self-pollen rejection, but was
weakened to completely broken down in 1-4 dae stigmas as self-pollen
tubes were allowed to grow and penetrate the senescent stigmas. as
senescence progresses further, the number of self-pollen tubes and cross-
pollen tubes were both significantly reduced in 5 dae stigmas (p< 0.0001)
and 6 dae stigmas (p < 0.0001) relative to their counterparts in 3 dae
stigmas (figure 18). this was accompanied by notably shrunk stigmas
reflecting collapse of papilla cells in 5 and 6 dae stigmas (figure 1),
suggesting that the functional life span to receive pollen tubes has started to
end in 5 and 6 dae stigmas (figure 18). to test the effect of senescence on
the formation of self-fertilized seeds in si chinese cabbage, we pollinated
0-4 dae pistils from young plants with self-pollen grains and compared pod
length and seed setting at 12 dap. we found that 0 dae pistils showed the

shortest pods (figure 1d) and almost no seeds in the pods (figure 1e), an
the formation of selt-tertilized seeds in si chinese cabbage, we pollinated

0-4 dae pistils from young plants with self-pollen grains and compared pod
length and seed setting at 12 dap. we found that 0 dae pistils showed the
shortest pods (figure 1d) and almost no seeds in the pods (figure 1), an
indication of robust si in young pistils. in contrast, the pods became longer
and had more seeds per pod with the progress of senescence in 1-3 dae
pistils (figures 10,€), but the pods became shorter and had fewer seeds in 4
dae pistils than 2-3 dae pistils (figures 1d,£). considering that there are
only ~30 ovules in each pistil, 2-4 dae pistils have more than enough pollen
tubes, whether self- or cross-pollen tubes, to fertilize each ovule in the pistil
however, some ovules in 4 dae pistils might be too old to form seeds. we
therefore did not record the self-fertilized seeds in the withered 5 and 6 dae
pistils, although a few self-pollen tubes managed to penetrate (figures 1b,c)

to examine whether plant senescence has any impact on the strength of si,
we pollinated 0-5 dae stigmas from old plants with self- or cross-pollen
from young plants. results showed that the number of self-pollen tubes and
cross-pollen tubes in 0-4 dae stigmas from old plants were all more than
60, except that neither self- nor cross-pollen tubes germinated on 5 dae
stigmas (supplementary figures 18,c). in contrast to 0 self-pollen tubes in 0
dae stigmas from young plants, the finding that there were more than 60
self-pollen tubes in 0 dae stigmas from old plants prompted us to verify
whether the breakdown of si in 0 dae stigmas from old plants is common in
other varieties of chinese cabbage. we emasculated 0-d flowers from three
varieties of young and old chinese cabbage plants (figure 2a and

whether the breakdown of si in 0 dae stigmas from old plants is common in
other varieties of chinese cabbage. we emasculated 0-d flowers from three
varieties of young and old chinese cabbage plants (figure 2a and
supplementary figure 1d), pollinated them with self-pollen grains, and
observed the number of self-pollen tubes that had penetrated each stigma
results showed that while no self-pollen germinated or penetrated the 0
dae stigmas from young plants, an average of 50-100 self-pollen tubes
penetrated that from old plants in all three varieties of s| chinese cabbage
plants (figure 2b and supplementary figure 1e). for the pod growth and
seed formation, 0-d flowers from young and old plants of three varieties of
chinese cabbage were emasculated and pollinated with self-pollen, and the
pod length and seed setting were compared at 12 dap. similar to our
findings in senescent flowers, self-pollinated pistils from old plants showed
significantly longer pods and many more seeds per pod than those from
young plants in all three varieties of chinese cabbage (figures 2c,d and
supplementary figures 1f,g). taken together, our results suggest that flower
senescence and plant senescence behave similarly in breaking down si in
chinese cabbage.

 

senescence leads to pcd in stigmatic papilla cells in chinese cabbage

we previously found in chinese cabbage that pcd in stigmatic papilla cells is
induced by and required for cross-pollination but is abrogated in self-
pollinated stigmas (su et al., 2020; supplementary figure 2a). we therefore
tested whether pcd is involved in senescence-associated breakdown of si in

induced by and required for cross-pollination but is abrogated in self-
pollinated stigmas (su et al., 2020; supplementary figure 2a). we therefore
tested whether pcd is involved in senescence-associated breakdown of si in
chinese cabbage. we first tested the compromise of plasma membrane
integrity, which is a morphological feature of pcd (kabbage et al., 2017). pl
was used as a cell death indicator, with pl-stained nuclei reflecting plasma
membrane permeability in dead papilla cells (su et al., 2020). we found that
the percentage of pl-stained nuclei was lower than 5% in unpollinated 0 dae
stigmas, whereas it increased to 20% and 60% in 1 and 3 dae stigmas,
respectively (figures 3a,b and supplementary figure 2b). another cell death
indicator, trypan blue, showed that ~45% papilla cells in 4 dae stigmas were
stained blue whereas no blue papilla cells were found in 0 dae stigmas
(supplementary figure 3a). altogether, our finding that the increasing
number of dead papilla cells in 0-3 dae stigmas was in line with the
increasing number of self-pollen tubes in 0-3 dae stigmas suggests that
water and other factors might leak out of the porous papilla cells to support
the germination and growth of self-pollen. meanwhile, the comparable
number of cross-pollen tubes in 0-3 dae stigmas (figure 18) suggests that
pcd in 0-3 dae stigmas does not significantly compromise the receptivity
of the stigma.

senescence induces breakdown of si in chinese cabbage

to examine the effect of senescence on si in chinese cabbage, we first
characterized the stage of flowers and the stage of plants. in field and
greenhouse experiments, flowers from brassica family plants senesce within
1 day after cross-pollination, whereas flowers that have not been pollinated
by compatible pollen last 2-5 days on the inflorescence even after they pass
the prime pollination stage. flowers that are just open and have indehiscent
anthers are designated as 0-d flowers (figure 1). for experiments in this
study, we emasculated 0-d flowers and allowed them to grow for another
0-6 days before pollination or analysis. for brevity, these pistils or stigmas
were referred to as 0-6 dae pistils or 0-6 dae stigmas. to correlate with
the naturally senescent flowers, we marked the 0-d flowers and observed
their morphologies at 1-6 days after anthesis. as shown in figure 1a, 1-d
flowers have dehiscent anthers full of yellow pollen grains and anthers above
the stigma; 2-d flowers have withering anthers and anthers as tall as the
stigma; 3-d flowers have withered anthers and petals start to close; 4-d
flowers are completely closed (figure 1a); 5-d and 6-d flowers have a
withered pistil and all other floral organs are abscised (figure 1a). for the
stage of plants, plants from early bolting stage to full-bloom stage were
designated as young plants (figure 2a and supplementary figures 1a,d) that
have been growing for 35-65 days after vernalization under our growth

heading chinese cabbage double haploid "14 cr," which is an s4g
haplotype, and high-generation inbred line "6683" were from henan
academy of agricultural sciences. heading chinese cabbage dhb848 is a
commercial variety of chinese cabbage. if not specified, 14 cr was used
radish high-generation inbred line "weixianging 40” was from shandong
academy of agricultural sciences. flowering chinese cabbage high-
generation inbred line "youging 49 caixin” was from zhejiang university. all
of these plants—chinese cabbage, radish, and flowering chinese cabbage—
possess strong si, with no more than five self-pollen tubes penetrating the
stigma. chinese cabbage seeds and radish seeds were germinated in pots of
soil for 1 week, vernalized in ~7°c for ~1 month, and then planted in a
greenhouse. no vernalization process is needed for flowering chinese

reproduction phenotype observation and compatibility analysis

for pollen tube observation in the senescent flowers of chinese cabbage
and radish, 0-d flowers from just-bolted plants (young) were emasculated,
remained on the inflorescence for 0-6 days after emasculation (dae), and
pollinated with self- or cross-pollen. for pollen tube observation in flowers
of young or old plants of chinese cabbage and radish, 0-d flowers from just-
bolted plants (young) or from plants passed their full-bloom stage (old) were
emasculated and pollinated with self-pollen right away. stigmas at 6 h after
pollination (hap) were fixed in canoy’s fixative, softened in 10 m naoh, and
stained in 0.1% aniline blue. pollen tubes were visualized by epifluorescence
(ex375-328/dm415/ba351p) on a nikon eclipse ni and captured by a ds-ri2
digital camera. strong si was defined as when stigmas were penetrated with
0-5 self-pollen tubes, and medium si was defined as when stigmas were
penetrated with 5-30 self-pollen tubes. breakdown of si or compatible
response was defined as when stigmas were penetrated with more than 30
self- or cross-pollen tubes, respectively. the impact of senescence,
chemicals, or related genes on compatibility was presented as number of
pollen tubes that had penetrated the stigma

pistils at 12 days after pollination (dap) were measured for pod length and
counted for the number of seeds per pod. strong si was defined as when the
average seed number was fewer than one per pod

pistils at 12 days arter pollination (vap) were measured for pod length ana
counted for the number of seeds per pod. strong si was defined as when the
average seed number was fewer than one per pod

transient gene suppression using anti-sense oligodeoxyribonucleotide
(as-odn)

for transient gene suppressing using as-odn, stigmas mock treated or
treated with s-odn were used as control. protocol followed that of su et al.
(2020). in brief, ~1 mm of the unpollinated 0 dae stigmas were cut and
placed on the pgm medium (5 mm caclp, 5 mm kcl, 0.01% h3boz, 1 mm
mgso4-7h20, 10% sucrose, ph 7.5, and 1% agarose) containing the
corresponding s- or as-odn, or mock solution for 1 h, then pollinated with
cross-pollen. the stigmas were maintained in a small well and kept in an
incubator with 22.5°c/45% humidity. treated stigmas were then fixed in
canoy’s fixative at 2 hap, softened in 10 m naoh, and stained in 0.1% aniline
blue to check for pollen tube growth and pcd in the stigma.

 

s- or as-odn was designed based on the analysis by sfold") and rnafold?,
and blast program® was used to assess potential off-target effect. to
maintain odn stability, 3 bases at both ends of s- or as-odn were
phosphorothioate modified. odns were synthesized in beijing genomics
institution (bgi). at least three pairs of as-odn and s-ogn were tested, and
sequences that are most effective are listed in supplementary table 2.

stigmatic papilla cell death detection

for the detection of pcd in the stigma, propidium iodide (pi) or trypan blue
was used as cell death indicators. for pi staining, stigmas were stained in 50
him pi (pbs, ph7.5) for 20 min, washed three times in pbs, and observed in
the red channel (ex 535 mm/ba 615 nm) on a nikon eclipse ni, and images
were captured by a ds-ri2 digital camera. for the demonstration of nucleus
change with the progression of senescence, pl-stained nuclei in 1-6 dae
stigmas were measured for area and also for the ratio of length/width. for
trypan blue staining, 0 dae stigmas and 4 dae stigmas were stained in 0.01%
trypan blue at 40°c for 30 min, washed in water three times, decolorized in
carnoy's fixative for 3 days, and washed in water before observation under
brightfield on a nikon smz18, and images were captured by a ds-ri2 digital
camera. for the effect of self- or cross-pollination on pcd in the stigma, o-d
flowers were emasculated, remained unpollinated, or pollinated with self- or
cross-pollen. for the effect of senescence on pcd, pistils at 0-4 dae from
young plants or 0 dae pistils from young or old plants were kept
unpollinated or pollinated with self-pollen. for the effect of as-odn on
pcd, 0 dae stigmas were mock treated or pretreated with s- or as-odn for
1h and then pollinated with cross-pollen. stigmas at 1 hap were used for pi
staining.

ethephon spray to promote the formation of self-fertilized seeds

inflorescences from young plants of flowering chinese cabbage (brassica
campestris l. spp. chinensis var. utilis tsen et lee) and radish (r. sativus) were
used for ethephon spray. senescent flowers and the floral buds together
with the shoot meristem were removed and only 0-d flowers remained on
the inflorescences. inflorescences were sprayed twice at a 30-min interval
with different concentrations of ethephon supplemented with 0.0125%
tween-20 for better permeability. inflorescences sprayed with water
containing 0.0125% tween-20 were used as control. when the stigmas were
dried, which takes ~1 h, pistils were pollinated with self-pollen grains and
the inflorescences were put in mesh bags. pod length and seed number per
pod were recorded after 12 dap.

introduction

self-incompatibility (si) is a genetic mechanism widely adopted by flowering
plants and present in roughly half of the species to promote outcrossing and
prevent inbreeding (de nettancourt, 1977). a prevalent system is the
sporophytic si system in the brassicaceae vegetable plants, such as brassica
rapa, brassica oleracea, and raphanus sativus (nasrallah, 2019; jany et al,
2019). as the brassicaceae have dry stigmas, only compatible pollen grains
are capable of inducing the stigma to release necessary resources, such as
water and other factors, but the absence of surface secretions prevents si
pollen or unrelated foreign pollen from adhering, hydrating, and germinating
at the earliest stages of pollination (samuel et al., 2009; jany et al., 2019).
brassicaceae s| is controlled by two genetically linked polymorphic s loci:
the pollen-coat-expressed s-locus cysteine-rich protein (sp11/scr) and the
stigma-specific s-locus ser/thr receptor kinase (srk) (nasrallah, 2019). the
recognition of self-pollen is dependent on the interaction of srk with
spli/scr of the same s haplotype (takayama et al., 2001; kachroo et al.,
2001; ma et al., 2016). subsequent intracellular signaling pathways in the
papilla cells ultimately lead to the rejection of self-pollen either by blocking
hydration and germination of pollen or by restricting pollen tube growth into
the stigma (samuel et al., 2009; indriolo et al., 2012; sankaranarayanan et

self-incompatibility is used as a breeding tool for f1 hybrid production in a
broad range of the brassicaceae crops (nou et al., 1993), as hybrid vigor is
highly valued in the agricultural industry. for hybrid seed production, ideal si
inbred lines are required to have strong and stable si to prevent self-fertilized
seeds. for the propagation of si inbred lines, si is required to be broken
down in order to form self-fertilized seeds. however, the underlying
mechanism regulating si strength remains largely unknown. it has been
reported that transforming the cognate pair of scr-srk into arabidopsis
ecotype col-0 transits the self-compatible (sc) arabidopsis thaliana into si,
but senescent flowers, i., at late stage 14, in these transformed plants have
considerably weakened si (nasrallah et al, 2002, 2004; tantikanjana and
nasrallah, 2012). in wild radish and in other species, older unpollinated
flowers or flowers from older plants discriminate less between outcrossed
pollen and self-pollen and are more prone to self-fertilize (marshall et al.,
2010). in the breeding industry, these old unpollinated flowers and flowers
from old plants would allow the production of self-fertilized seeds, thus
compromising the purity of desired hybrid seeds. therefore, it is important to
understand the underlying mechanism regulating senescence-associated
breakdown of si, which has not been characterized at all.

breakdown of si, which has not been characterized at all.

programmed cell death (pcd) is known to be important and highly regulated
during plant growth and development, successful sexual reproduction, and
response to biotic and abiotic environmental stresses (wu and cheung,
2000; xie et al., 2014; gong et al., 2015; daneva et al., 2016; huysmans et
al,, 2017; noman et al, 2020; su et al., 2020; zhang et al., 2020). for
example, in the senescence of leaf or flower in a. thaliana, senescence-
associated genes (sags) are highly upregulated (shahri and tahir, 2014)
upstream regulator involves the key transcription factors triggering the
senescence process, such as oresara1 (ore) (wagstaff et al., 2009),
which functions as part of a regulatory network downstream of ethylene
signaling (kim et al., 2009, 2014). in the stigma, ore1-mediated pcd in the
papilla cells terminate floral receptivity in aging unpollinated flowers (gao et
al,, 2018). based on transcriptional analysis of compatible and incompatible
pollinations in brassica napus, it has been suggested that a rapid stigma
senescence response followed compatible pollination (sankaranarayanan et
al,, 2013). however, whether the stigma senescence plays a role in the
compatible pollination or has merely resulted from compatible pollination,
which is common in many angiosperms (weber and goodwillie, 2007;
spigler, 2017), was not clear at that time. we showed earlier in b. rapa that
pcd in the stigmatic papilla cells is triggered by cross-pollination and
suppressing pcd inhibits compatible pollination, resulting in a process that

spigler, 2017), was not clear at that time. we showed earlier in b. rapa that
pcd in the stigmatic papilla cells is triggered by cross-pollination and
suppressing pcd inhibits compatible pollination, resulting in a process that
resembles the si responses (su et al., 2020). we also showed that treating
stigmas with ethephon, an ethylene-releasing reagent, induces pcd in the
stigmatic papilla cells and breaks down si in heading chinese cabbage (su et
al,, 2020). these results suggested a close relationship between pcd in the
stigmatic papilla cells and pollen germination and penetration of the stigma.

   

in this study, we utilized chinese cabbage (b. rapa l. spp. pekinensis) and
radish (r. sativus) to investigate the molecular mechanism regulating the
strength of si in senescent flowers and flowers of senescent plants. we
focused on the stigmatic papilla cells as the earliest interface for pollen
germination and penetration of compatible pollen, or rejection of si pollen.
we show that si was significantly compromised or completely lost in
senescent flowers and young flowers of senescent plants, which is closely
associated with senescence-induced pcd in papilla cells. expression of
brsag29 and brsag12 and the transcription factor brore1 were
upregulated, suppressing them by antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotide (as-
odn) in young flowers abrogated compatible pollination-triggered pcd and
consequently inhibited the growth and penetration of compatible pollen
furthermore, ethylene biosynthesis genes and ethylene response genes were
upregulated in senescent stigmas, and manipulating the level of ethylene or
its response affected the expression of brsags and brore1. our findings

overcome si for the propagation of parental inbred lines.
self-incompatibility (si) is a genetic mechanism flowering plants adopted to
reject self-pollen and promote outcrossing. in the brassicaceae family plants,
the stigma tissue plays a key role in self-pollen recognition and rejection. we
reported earlier in chinese cabbage (brassica rapa) that stigma tissue
showed upregulated ethylene responses and programmed cell death (pcd)
upon compatible pollination, but not in si responses. here, we show that si
is significantly compromised or completely lost in senescent flowers and
young flowers of senescent plants. senescence upregulates senescence-
associated genes in b. rapa. suppressing their expression in young stigmas by
antisense oligodeoxyribonucleotide abolishes compatible pollination
triggered pcd and inhibits the growth of compatible pollen tubes.
furthermore, ethylene biosynthesis genes and response genes are
upregulated in senescent stigmas, and increasing the level of ethylene or
inhibiting its response increases or decreases the expression of senescence-
associated genes, respectively. our results show that senescence causes
pcd in stigmatic papilla cells and is associated with the breakdown of si in
chinese cabbage and in radish
