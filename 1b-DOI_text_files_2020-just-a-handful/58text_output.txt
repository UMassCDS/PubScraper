8.5. conclusions

despite limitations, the present study is among the first to
directly compare the effect of social versus non-social
stressors on emotional reactivity and regulation among those
with high bpd features in daily life. the present findings
suggest that social stress may exacerbate urges for
dysfunctional behavior, and attenuate functional emotion
regulation in the presence of elevated bpd features,
inpointing important areas for potential prevention or
intervention efforts among individuals with a range of bpd
features. further, they offer critical implications for the
treatment of bpd features that may be emerging in the
context of an undergraduate sample. undergraduate studies
can be a period of heightened social pressure for many. our
treatment of bpd features that may be emerging in the
context of an undergraduate sample. undergraduate studies
can be a period of heightened social pressure for many. our
findings suggest that helping young adults with elevated bpd
features effectively cope with stressful social situations by
engaging in effective regulatory behaviors (e.g,, calling a
friend, engaging in exercise, distracting with music) or
employing communication skills may help prevent the
engagement of behaviors that may escalate bpd features as
well as social and emotional problems over time.
furthermore, identifying students who may be struggling in
these areas is essential for more targeted, and potentially
preventative, intervention. further, whereas many efficacious
treatments for bpd features focus on training clients on more
functional approaches to responding to emotionally stressful
situations (blumetal., 2008; gratzetal., 2012; gratzand
gunderson,2006; linehan, 1993), the present findings suggest
that focusing these trainings specifically to challenging social
contexts where skills deficits may emerge could optimize
treatment outcomes. finally, examining and targeting the

8.4. limitations

 

several limitations of this study warrant mention. first, this
study relied on a relatively racially and ethnically
homogeneous, non-treatment-seeking college student
sample. although this is a relevant sample, given that college-
aged individuals exhibit relatively elevated rates of bpd
(trull, 1995), future work is needed to ascertain whether
these findings hold in clinical samples or in diverse
populations. related, as we did not measure which
participants did and did not have diagnoses of bpd,
thése riiaings noid in ciiniéai sanpies grin averse
populations. related, as we did not measure which
participants did and did not have diagnoses of bpd, it is

icult to determine whether “clinical” populations with
bpd might differ meaningfully in the relationships studied
compared to individuals with less severe bpd features.
second, we relied on brief assessments of emotions and
emotion regulation in daily life. this approach reduced
participant burden, given the daily assessment, but it likely
reduced the reliability of these measures. third, although our
use of a daily diary method may have reduced retrospective
recall bias, it was not eliminated completely. furthermore,
the relatively coarse daily assessments do not permit a more
nuanced understanding of the interplay of emotional and
interpersonal dynamics over the course of a typical day.
indeed, this method makes it difficult to disentangle the
temporal precedence of the variables under study, and it is
therefore unclear whether the negative emotion, urges to
engage in behavior, and actual engagement of behavior are
related and occurred in the same or distinct moments
throughout the day. ecological momentary assessment

paradigms may be used to further refine and disentangle the
temporal nature of the relationships in the present study,
with minimal retrospective recall bias.

 

   
8.2. bpd features and urges to engage in emotion
regulatory behavior

unlike with emotional reactivity, stressor type emerged as a
moderator of the effect of bpd features on urges for
dysfunctional emotion regulatory behaviors. in particular,
individuals with elevated bpd features reported greater urges
for dysfunctional behaviors and less functional behaviors in
response to social versus non-social stress. these findings
were generally apparent across overt and covert
dysfunctional behaviors (although only a trend emerged for
the former). as such, these findings generally align with work
indicating that individuals high in bpd features exhibit more
dysfunctional behaviors in response to social stressors (e.g.,
rumination in adults, napolitanoetal., 2020; poor problem
solving, dixon-gordonetal., 2011, or aggressive tendencies in
college students, tragesseretal., 2008) than their
counterparts with lower bpd features.

dixui-guluulelal., zu11, uf azzlessive lehuehues
college students, tragesseretal., 2008) than their
counterparts with lower bpd features.

it is unclear why bpd features predicted differential urges to
engage in dysfunctional emotion regulatory behavior
following social relative to non-social stress, but this effect
was not evident for the negative emotional reactivity that
these behaviors supposedly regulate. indeed, this discrepancy
in findings suggests that the association between bpd and
more dysfunctional emotion regulation urges in social
contexts is not likely accounted for by differences in the
emotion experienced in response to these distinct stressors.
given the relatively coarse retrospective timeframe, it is
possible that the emotion regulation attenuated any
differences in emotional reactivity. it is also possible that,
given some evidence that bpd features are associated with
lower tolerance for negative emotions in student samples
(kiselicaetal., 2014), even relatively small or undetectable
increases in negative emotion may prompt efforts to avoid or
escape such emotions. it is also worth noting that, although
participants reported engaging in the emotion regulatory
increases in negative emotion may prompt efforts to avoid or
escape such emotions. it is also worth noting that, although
participants reported engaging in the emotion regulatory
behaviors assessed in response to stress, it is possible that
these behaviors did not, or only partially functioned to,
regulate emotion. indeed, research suggests that some
destructive behaviors such as non-suicidal self-injury, can
function for both intrapersonal (e.g,, to regulate emotion) and
interpersonal (e.g. to influence or communicate to others)
reasons (klonskyetal., 2015). such interpersonal functions of
dysfunctional behaviors may be particularly salient for
individuals with high bpd features given the hi
interpersonal dysfunction in community and clinical samples
iiagnoses with bpd (bouchardetal., 2009; hilletal., 2011).
dysfunctional behaviors may therefore be maintained for
individuals with high bpd features not only because they
regulate emotion, but also because they may result in
interpersonal needs being met. further research should
consider assessing the consequences of emotion regulatory
behaviors in bpd to better understand their functions.

contrary to study hypotheses, bpd features predicted higher
urges to engage in functional emotion regulatory behaviors,
although this did not differ across stressor type. such findings
are consistent with other daily diary research suggesting that
higher bpd features predicts higher use of functional emotion
regulation strategies in college students (fitzpatricketal.,
2018), as well as data suggesting that bpd features is linked
to greater use of a range of emotion regulation strategies,
both functional and dysfunctional, among college students
(dixon-gordonetal., 2015). research suggests that bpd is
characterized by avoidance of emotional states among young
adults (eg., iversonetal., 2012). individuals high in bpd
features may therefore deploy any and all emotion regulatory
strategies available in response to distress as an attempt to
avoid or eradicate it. notably, fitzpatricketal.(2018) found
that, although high bpd features predicted more frequent use
of functional emotion regulation strategies among college
students, it also predicted lower perceived effectiveness of
that, although high bpd features predicted more frequent use
of functional emotion regulation strategies among college
students, it also predicted lower perceived effectiveness of
these strategies. individuals high in bpd features may
therefore have the urge to cycle quickly between different
emotion regulation strategies, functional or otherwise, and
ultimately “default” to wanting to engage in dysfunctional
ones because they do not perceive functional strategies to be
effective. it is alternatively possible that, whereas the
dysfunctional strategies are likely consistently dysfunctional,
the functional strategies defined here may only be functional
when the precise strategy fits the context. this heterogeneity
of functional strategy effectiveness in a given situation may
contribute to the low internal consistency of this measure,
and aligns with past data showing that adaptive strategies are
only inconsistently or weakly associated with
psychopathology (aldaoand nolen-hoeksema,2012).

8.3. bpd features and the engagement of emotion
regulatory behavior

 

 

although there was a significant interaction between stressor
type and bpd features predicting urges to engage in
dysfunctional behavior, this interaction did not translate to
greater engagement in dysfunctional behaviors - whether
overt or covert - in social contexts. despite this, higher bpd
features predicted greater use of dysfunctional emotion
regulation behaviors, consistent with other daily diary
studies that similarly suggest that bpd features are associated
with greater dysfunctional emotion regulation strategy use
among college students (e.g., fitzpatricketal., 2018). it is
possible that the relatively low rate of dysfunctional
behaviors, and potentially low severity of our sample,
reduced our ability to detect this effect. it is therefore critical
that this question be addressed in a sample at risk for more
frequent dysfunctional behaviors, such as within clinical
samples. alternatively, although individuals with bpd
features may want to engage in dysfunctional behaviors more
so in response to social than non-social stressors, they may

features may want to engage in dysfunctional behaviors more
so in response to social than non-social stressors, they may
also perceive there to be greater consequences of doing so.
engaging in dysfunctional behaviors in the presence of, or in
response to, others may result in social consequences
including ostracism, loss of employment, or the loss of
relationships. individuals high in bpd features may therefore
both experience heightened urges and heightened reluctance
to engage in dysfunctional emotion regulation behaviors in
response to social stress, which culminate to an absence of a
differential effect of stressor type on these behaviors.

there was an interaction between stressor type and bpd
features predicting the engagement of functional behaviors
such that those with higher bpd features were less likely
than those with lower bpd features to use functional emotion
regulation strategies in response to social compared to non-
social stress. that is, social stress appeared to “suppress”
functional emotion regulation behaviors for those with high
bpd features. this was particularly the case for exercise, with
a trend towards similar effects for rethinking an emotional
functional emotion regulation behaviors for those with high
bpd features. this was particularly the case for exercise, with
a trend towards similar effects for rethinking an emotional
situation and allowing or accepting feelings. whereas
dysfunctional emotion regulation behaviors may occur
impulsively, functional behaviors may not elicit immediate
interpersonal responses, and requires recognizing that
emotion is high and that such behaviors may be warranted.
this taxing behavioral sequence may be particularly
challenging in the face of competing social information and
input. as well, both of the functional behaviors that had a
trending interaction between stressor type and bpd features
(eg., rethinking an emotional situation, allowing or accepting
feelings) involve engaging with emotion and thus tolerating
distress. even if the degree of emotional reactivity elicited in
social versus non-social situations is comparable for
individuals with high bpd features, their capacity to tolerate
that distress may not be. accordingly, individuals with high
bpd features may have greater difficulty persisting with
approach-oriented emotion regulation strategies in response
to social stressors. importantly, the suppression of functional
bpd features may have greater difficulty persisting with
approach-oriented emotion regulation strategies in response
to social stressors. importantly, the suppression of functional
behaviors in response to social stress may have long-term
deleterious consequences on interpersonal relationships
among those with elevated bpd features. future work should
examine how use of specific emotion regulation strategies
affects relationship quality to offer a road for enhancing
interpersonal functioning in bpd.

 

 
 

stressors that do and do not elicit differential heightened

emotional reactivity in bpd with greater granularity.
8.1. bpd features and emotional reactivity

partially aligned with our hypotheses, bpd features predicted
higher negative emotional reactivity. in addition, there was
evidence of greater positive emotional reactivity. as such,
these data align with other research suggesting that bpd is
associated with heightened emotional reactivity in daily life
(glaseretal., 2008). the positive emotion reactivity contrasts
with past findings of attenuated positive emotional reactivity
in bpd compared to controls in daily life (houbenetal., 2018).
however, contrary to hypotheses, the elevated negative
emotions were not more pronounced in response to social
stress, relative to non-social stress, in contrast with
experimental studies that pointed to greater emotional
reactivity to social stressors relative to comparison stressors
among participants diagnosed with bpd (e.g., elicesetal.,
2012; saueretal., 2013) and college students with elevated
bpd features (e.g., chapmanetal., 2015, 2014). whereas the
social stressors utilized in experimental paradigms often

bpd features (e.g., chapmanetal., 2015, 2014). whereas the
social stressors utilized in experimental paradigms often
depict highly distressing themes (e.g., abuse, abandonment,
sexual assault; elicesetal., 2012; saueretal., 2013) or involve
irect negative evaluation or rejection (e.g., chapmanetal.,
2015, 2014), it is possible that the daily social stressors were
more mild in nature. indeed, review of the content of these
social interactions revealed some bpd-relevant themes (e.g.,
social rejection, conflict), but also themes that may not
necessarily be more distressing or potent to individuals with
high vs. low bpd features (e.g., learning of the death of an
important other; giving a class presentation or interviewing
for a new job; preparing for a date; discussing financial
struggles with a family member; managing difficult dynamics
in the context of a group project). such potent social stressors
may indeed differentially elicit exaggerated emotional
reactivity, whereas more minor daily social stressors may not.

 

 

   

 

relatedly, it is also possible that the type of social stress
matters. the present study conceptualized social stress
broadly, whereas much of the existing work that has found
relatedly, it is also possible that the type of social stress
matters. the present study conceptualized social stress
broadly, whereas much of the existing work that has found
elevated emotional reactivity to social stress in diagnosed
bpd and elevated bpd features samples focused on
interpersonal rejection in particular (chapmanetal., 2014;
limbergetal., 2011) as well as traumatic interpersonal
content (e.g., abuse, assault; elicesetal., 2012; saueretal.,
2013). perhaps, given the high rates of relationship
issolution, dysfunction (bouchardetal., 2009; hilletal.,
2011), and interpersonal traumas such as sexual assault
(westphaletal., 2013) in bpd, content that mirrors
rejection/abandonment or interpersonal traumas specifically,
rather than social stress broadly, is uniquely evocative for this
group. such cues are meaningfully distinct from other forms
of social stress (e.g., presentation at work), which may not be
particularly evocative to individuals with elevated bpd
features. future research is advised to probe the social
differential heightened
emotional reactivity in bpd with greater granularity.

8. discussion

the aim of this study was to examine whether individuals
with higher bpd features exhibited greater emotional
reactivity and regulation processes than those with low bpd
features, especially in response to daily social versus non-
social stressors. we hypothesized that bpd features would
predict greater negative emotional reactivity and decreases in
positive emotions, greater urges for and engagement in
dysfunctional emotion regulatory behaviors, and less urges
for and engagement in functional emotion regulation.
furthermore, given the interpersonal sensitivity theorized to
underlie bpd (gundersonand lyons-ruth,2008), and the
wide-ranging social
(lazarusetal., 2014), we expected these associations would be
exaggerated in response to daily social stressors.

in order to probe the specific types of dysfunctional behavior

 

in order to probe the specific types of dysfunctional behavior
impacted by social stress and bpd features, we also examined
whether the direction and si
varied on the basis of whether the behavioral urges were for
overt (ie., eat a lot of food, drink alcohol, argue with others,
avoid the situation altogether, harm yourself or self-injure,
hit someone or throw things, spend money you don't have,
use drugs, purge (vomiting, laxatives, etc.), and have
impulsive or risky (e.g., unprotected) sex) or covert (i.
feelings from others, worry or ruminate, avoid thinking about
the situation) behaviors. we computed two variables, overt
and covert dysfunctional behaviour urges, which summed up
urges to engage in behaviors in their relative categories, and
re-ran primary study analyses with these two variables as
outcomes. there was a trend towards a significant stressor
typexbpd features interaction predicting overt dysfunctional
urges (b=-0.002, se=0.001), x2 (1)=3.20, p=.074, and a
significant stressor typexbpd features interaction predicting
covert dysfunctional urges (b=-0.013, se=0.006), y? (1

covert dysfunctional urges (b=-0.013, se=0.006), y?(1)=4.28,

dysfunctional urges to a greater extent in response to social
than non-social stress.

7. results
6.4. data analytic strategy

primary study analyses were conducted using generalized
estimating equations (gee; burtonetal., 1998; diggleetal.,
2013; hubbardetal., 2010), a semi-parametric analysis
derived from generalized linear modelling. gee
accommodates both repeated measures and participants with
missing data while being robust to misspecification of the
covariance structure. six gee models were run for six
outcomes: negative emotion, positive emotion, urges for
dysfunctional emotion regulatory behavior, urges for
functional emotion regulatory behavior, engagement in
dysfunctional emotion regulatory behavior, and engagement
in functional emotion regulatory behavior. there was notable
positive skew in the positive emotion (skew=1.65), urges for
dysfunctional behavior (skew=1.99), and engagement in
dysfunctional behavior (skew=2.14) variables. data from
positive skew in the positive emotion (skew=1.65), urges for
dysfunctional behavior (skew=1.99), and engagement in
dysfunctional behavior (skew=2.14) variables. data from
other outcome variables approximated a normal distribution
(skew=0.45-1.11). positive emotion and urges for
dysfunctional behavior variables were logarithmically
transformed (base 10, adding one unit to urges) to yield more
normal distributions (skew=0.82 and -0.08, respectively).
given that engagement in dysfunctional behavior is a count
variable, it was not transformed; analyses were instead run
using a negative binomial distribution, which accommodates
positively-skewed count variables. we re-ran all analyses
with day as a covariate, and the significance of results was
unchanged with one exception which is noted below. given
the lack of hypotheses pertaining to this variable, we retained
final models without its inclusion.

  

 

 

 

across all analyses, bpd features, stressor type (social versus
non-social), and stressor typexbpd feature interactions were
entered as predictors. for emotional reactivity, trait emotion

considered, and the model with the lowest quasilikelihood
information criteria was retained.

this 24-item questionnaire is a widely used measure of bpd
features in undergraduate samples (e.g., trull,2001) and is
associated with interview-based diagnoses of bpd
(jacoboetal., 2007). internal consistency was excellent for the
overall scale (a=0.92).

6.3.2. baseline emotions

the positive and negative affect schedule (panas;
watsonetal., 1988) was used to assess trait negative and
positive emotions. this measure contains 10 negative and 10
positive adjectives, comprising the negative and positive
affect scales, respectively. each item is rated on a scale from 1
(very slightly or not at all) to 5 (extremely). internal
consistency was excellent for both scales (negative: a=0.91;
positive: a=0.91).

 

6.3.3. daily emotion and emotion regulation
assessment

at the start of each daily assessment, participants were asked

assessment

at the start of each daily assessment, participants were asked
to identify the most stressful social and non-social events
since the previous report, and to consider these events in
subsequent ratings. social and non-social events were not
defined and were left up to the interpretation of the
participant. participants were asked to describe the “content
of the event (what were you doing? what happened?)” for
non-social events, and the “content of the interaction (what
were you doing and talking about?)” for social events. an
informal review of the identified content revealed that
77.32% of the reported social events explicitly identified
involved interactions with another person (e.g. “my mom
lectured me,” “i was fighting with my sister over a piece of
clothing”), whereas this was only the case for 8.96% of the
reported non-social events. the majority of non-social events
were related to managing workloads and stressors (e.g.,
“getting an exam back with a non-satisfactory grade,”
“getting my chemistry homework done”). participants
completed the panas (watsonetal., 1988) in reference to
“getting an exam back with a non-satisfactory grade,”
“getting my chemistry homework done”). participants
completed the panas (watsonetal., 1988) in reference to
each stressor. internal consistency on this scale across days
was good to excellent for the negative (as=0.84-0.92) and
positive (as=0.85-0.93) affect scales.

participants were prompted to rate their urges to act and
identify actions they took that day “in order to feel better” in
response to their most stressful social and non-social events
that day (based on chapmanetal., 2009). dysfunctional
emotion regulation behaviors were assessed across
intrapersonal strategies (aldaoetal., 2010; aldaoand dixon-
gordon,2014), including: (1) hide your feelings from others,
(2) worry or ruminate about the situation, and (3) avoid
thinking about it. we also assessed overt dysfunctional
emotion regulation behaviors (aldaoand dixon-
gordon,2014), including: (4) eat a lot of food, (5) drink
alcohol, (6) argue with others, (7) avoid the situation
altogether, (8) harm yourself or self-injure, (9) hit someone or
throw things, (10) spend money you don't have, (11) use
dlconof,(b) argue witn others, ( /)'avoid the situation’
altogether, (8) harm yourself or self-injure, (9) hit someone or
throw things, (10) spend money you don't have, (11) use
drugs, (12) purge (vomiting, laxatives, etc.), and (19) have
impulsive or risky (e.g., unprotected) sex. functional emotion
regulation behaviors were also assessed across intrapersonal
strategies (aldaoetal., 2010; aldaoand dixon-gordon,2014),
including (1) come up with ideas to change the situation, (2)
think of the situation differently in order to feel better, (3)
allow or accept your feelings, and overt behaviors, including
(4) exercise, and (5) seek advice from others. across days,
internal consistency was questionable to excellent for
dysfunctional («s=0.68-0.90) and functional (as=0.62-0.78)
urges.

for all dysfunctional and functional emotion regulation
behaviors, participants rated their urges to engage in any of
these behaviors on a scale from 0 (not at all) to 4 (extremely).
participants indicated whether they engaged in any of these
behaviors (present/absent). across days, internal consistency
was poor to acceptable for dysfunctional (as=0.48-0.84) and

6.1. participants

participants were 183 undergraduate students in a large
northeast united states public university who were recruited
as part of a larger study of emotion regulation in college
students (dixon-gordonetal., 2017; dixon-gordonand
laws,2019; haliczeretal., 2020). of the 183 participants that
provided baseline data, only 152 were compliant with the
study protocol (i.e., provided 24 days of data; > 83.06%
response; see procedure). compliance with the protocol was
not associated with age, t(176)=0.96, p=.337, race, °(5)=5.98,
p=.308, but was associated with disproportionately more
female-identified participants, °(1)=6.75, p=.009.

the final sample of 152 participants (mage=20.08, sd=2.31)
was predominantly female (86.18%), and white (65.79%). a
relatively smaller proportion endorsed a minority
racial/ethnic identity, including 15.13% asian, 5.92% black,
4.61% latinx, 5.92% multiracial, and 2.63% another
racial/ethnic category. participants’ average annual household
racial/ethnic identity, including 15.13% asian, 5.92% black,
4.61% latinx, 5.92% multiracial, and 2.63% another
racial/ethnic category. participants’ average annual household
income was $53,167.40 (sd=35,022.84). most participants
were full-time students (67.11%) and single (94.74%).
although this was a nonclinical sample, 21.71% of participants
endorsed a history of psychiatric treatment, and 16.45%
endorsed currently taking medications for a psychiatric
disorder.

5. current study

the present study therefore examined whether bpd features
predict differential emotional reactivity and regulation (ie.
urges for and engagement in functional and dysfunctional
emotion regulation behaviors) responses following real-life
social versus non-social stressors. we hypothesized that, in
response to daily stressors, bpd features would be associated
with (1) greater negative emotional reactivity and decreased
positive emotions; (2) greater urges for dysfunctional
emotion regulation behaviors, and lesser urges for functional
emotion regulation behaviors; and (3) more dysfunctional
emotion regulation behavior, and less functional emotion
regulation behavior. importantly, we predicted that all of the
aforementioned hypothesized effects would be particularly
pronounced in response to social compared to non-social
stressors.

 

  
4. the role of social contexts in emotional
responses in bpd

given the key role of interpersonal sensitivity in bpd
(gundersonand lyons-ruth,2008), the emotional reactivity
and regulation deficits that characterize bpd may be
especially pronounced in response to social stressors. data
show that social rejection or abandonment are among the
most common precipitants for distress in bpd (stiglmayretal.,
2005), and negative interpersonal experiences in daily life
were associated with greater negative emotions among
viduals with bpd than non-bpd clinical or healthy
participants (heppetal., 2018; houbenetal., 2018;
sadikajetal., 2010; steppetal., 2009). although general_
individuals with bpd than non-bpd clinical or healthy
participants (heppetal., 2018; houbenetal., 2018;
sadikajetal., 2010; steppetal., 2009). although general
emotional reacti mixed, experimental
paradigms that have utilized social stressors to elicit emotion
more consistently document heightened emotional reactivity
in bpd. for example, the exaggerated negative emotional
reactivity (across some emotions) seen in college students
with elevated (vs. low) bpd features was more pronounced in
response to social rejection stressors than a writing
evaluation (chapmanetal., 2014) or a stressful arithmetic task
(chapmanetal., 2015). likewise, bpd features were associated
with greater negative emotional reactivity to social exclusion,
but not to a sad film (napolitanoetal., 2020). compared to
healthy controls, individuals with bpd demonstrate higher
emotional reactivity to negative feedback (gratzetal., 2010),
and greater self-reported (elicesetal., 2012; saueretal., 2013)
and physiological reactivity in response to
rejection/abandonment-related cues (limbergetal., 2011), but
not more general stressors. although these findings suggest
that bpd is more consistently linked to negative emotional
rejection/abandonment-related cues (limbergetal., 2011), but
not more general stressors. although these findings suggest
that bpd is more consistently linked to negative emotional
reactivity in response to social stressors, it remains unclear
whether this differential effect on emotional reactivity is
present in individuals’ daily lives.

 

 

if emotion reactivity is particularly pronounced in response
to social stressors in bpd, then the dysfunctional emotion
regulation strategies deployed to modulate it may similarly
occur more specifically in these contexts. there is some
evidence that individuals with bpd may engage in more
dysfunctional and less functional emotion regulation in
response to social stressors. for instance, individuals with
elevated bpd features demonstrate impaired social problem-
solving (dixon-gordonetal., 2011) following a social stressor.
furthermore, individuals with elevated bpd features exhibit
more dysfunctional emotion regulation in the form of
rumination in response to social stressors, namely a
laboratory-based social exclusion paradigm, than other
stressors (i.e., a sad film; napolitanoetal., 2020). such
rumination in response to social stressors, namely a
laboratory-based social exclusion paradigm, than other
stressors (ie., a sad film; napolitanoetal., 2020). such
laboratory-based studies are limited in their reflection of how
individuals may respond to daily experiences of social stress
in their lives. one of the few studies in this area found that
bpd features were associated with greater rumination in
response to negative interpersonal stressors in daily life
(yaroslavskyetal., 2019). however, no studies to our
knowledge have examined whether the engagement of
dysfunctional and functional emotion regulation strategies is
ifferentially prompted by social versus non-social stressors
in daily life, given that social stressors utilized within lab
paradigms often lack ecological validity, it is necessary to
improve our understanding of the effect of real-life stressors
on real-life emotional reactivity and regulation processes in
relation to bpd.

 

 
3. dysfunctional emotion regulation in bpd

in addition to having altered emotional reactions to stimuli,
bpd is theorized to be linked to more dysfunctional
responses to managing these emotions (linehan, 1993).
emotion regulation can be deficient in several ways,
including having low emotional awareness, problematic
emotion regulation goals, and using ineffective or
dysfunctional emotion regulation strategies (grossand
jazaieri,2014). in general, the field has defined dysfunctional
emotion regulation strategies as those that demonstrate
positive associations with psychiatric symptoms or poorer
wellbeing, whereas functional emotion regulation strategies
refers to strategies that are inversely linked to psychiatric
symptoms (aldaoetal., 2010). to this end, dysfunctional
emotion regulation strategies can be covert, such as
emotional avoidance. suppression of emotional exvressions.
symptoms (aldaoetal., 2010). to this end, dysfunctional
emotion regulation strategies can be covert, such as
emotional avoidance, suppression of emotional expressions,
worry, and rumination, as well as overt, such as aggressive
behaviors, self-injury, substance use, binge eating, risky sex,
and other actions that serve to avoid or escape distress
(aldaoand dixon-gordon,2014). individuals with high (vs.
low) bpd features report more frequent use of dysfunctional
emotion regulation strategies (such as suppression and self-
punishment) and less perceived effectiveness of functional
strategies (involving processing emotions) in daily life
(fitzpatricketal., 2018), and bpd is associated with use of
dysfunctional regulatory strategies including rumination
(baerand sauer,2011), suppression (bebloetal., 2013), alcohol
use, situation and thought avoidance (aldaoand dixon-
gordon,2014), as well as emotional avoidance (iversonetal.,
2012). other data likewise suggests that bpd is linked to
dysfunctional overt emotion regulation strategies. for
instance, negative emotions predict use of alcohol use

2937).amone.those. with bpd. taken tneethes. bed tends to he
instance, negative emotions predict use of alcohol use
(jahngetal., 2011) and nonsuicidal self-injury (houbenetal.,
2017) among those with bpd. taken together, bpd tends to be
characterized by use of dysfunctional emotion regulation
strategies and heightened negative emotionality in response
to stressors both in the laboratory and in real-world contexts.
2. altered emotional reactivity in bpd

although emotional dysfunction is one of the core domains of
isturbance in bpd (gundersonetal., 2018), the literature
characterizing emotional reactivity in bpd remains mixed.
studies generally support that bpd symptoms are associated
with more frequent, intense, and persistent negative
emotions (chuetal., 2016), and individuals with bpd report
staates penetany sappor-diat wriyyynpinits aieuwwerace
with more frequent, intense, and persistent negative
emotions (chuetal., 2016), and individuals with bpd report
greater negative emotional intensity and instability (ebner
priemeretal., 2015; santangeloetal., 2012), and larger
increases in negative affect and decreases in positive affect in
response to stressors (glaseretal., 2008) in their daily lives
than those without bpd. other studies, however, paint a more
complicated picture of emotional reactivity and bpd. for
instance, although individuals with bpd report more intense
negative emotions than healthy participants in daily life
(kockleretal., 2020), this is not necessarily unique to bpd.
findings from laboratory-based examinations of emotional
reactivity in bpd have yielded more mixed results, with some
studies suggesting that bpd is associated with greater
subjective emotional reactivity (at least in some emotions) to
laboratory stressors (gratzetal., 2010), and other work
finding that bpd was associated with greater reported
negative emotions overall, but not greater negative emotional
reactivity to angry, joyful, or neutral stories than participants

substantial economic costs to society (vanasselt etal., 2007).
undergraduate student samples tend to have
disproportionately higher rates of bpd (trull, 1995), and bpd
and the engagement of life-threatening behavior (e.g., non-
suicidal self-injury) are strongly associated in undergraduate
samples (vegaetal., 2017). these findings suggest that bpd
processes may be particularly important to study in
undergraduate samples given this population's heightened
vulnerability to bpd and its adverse outcomes. indeed, even
at subthreshold levels (thompsonetal., 201
zimmermanetal., 2013), bpd is associated with emotional
(carpenterand trull,2013; rosenthaletal., 2008) and social
(lazarusetal., 2014) dysfunction. studying bpd features
zimmermanetal., 2013), bpd is associated with emotional
(carpenterand trull,2013; rosenthaletal., 2008) and social
(lazarusetal., 2014) dysfunction. studying bpd features
imensionally, rather than categorically, and in a sample that
is particularly vulnerable to them (ie., undergraduate
students) is therefore germane to illuminating key treatment
targets to reducing the social and emotionality dysregulation
linked with this pathology.

 

 

 

 

the biosocial theory of bpd (crowelletal., 2014, 2009;
linehan, 1993) proposes that disrupted emotion processes
such as a biological propensity for greater emotional
sensitivity, reactivity, and a slower recovery from emotional
reactions, coupled with deficits in modulating emotions, or
emotion regulation (grossand thompson,2007), characterizes
bpd. decades of research has particularly focused on
emotional reactivity and emotion regulation deficits.
although some (but not all) research suggests that bpd is
associated with altered emotional reactivity and emotion
regulation difficulties (rosenthaletal., 2008; santangeloetal.,
2012), less is known about whether this dysfunction is
associated with altered emotional reactivity and emotion
regulation difficulties (rosenthaletal., 2008; santangeloetal.,
2012), less is known about whether this dysfunction is
pervasive across contexts, or whether it is particularly
pronounced in the presence of distressing social cues, with
minimal research investigating this context-dependent
dysfunction in real life. given that bpd symptoms peak
during young adulthood (grantetal., 2008) and are especially
prevalent in college samples (up to 32.1%; meaneyetal.,
2016), it is particularly relevant to examine the associ
between bpd features and emotional responses in this
population.

conclusions

these findings suggest that individuals with elevated bpd
features may have less functional emotion regulation in social
contexts.

of these findings.

 
limitations

this study was limited by its focus on past-day retrospective
recall. further, the student sample limits the generalizability
of these findings.
results

generalized estimating equations revealed that bpd features
predicted greater negative and positive emotions in response
to daily stressors, and interacted with type of stressor in
predicting urges and behaviors. elevated bpd features was
associated with greater urges for dysfunctional emotion
regulatory behaviors and fewer functional emotion
regulatory behaviors to a greater extent in response to social
(versus non-social) stressors.
background

borderline personality disorder (bpd) is associated with
emotional dysfunction and interpersonal sensitivity. yet, little
work has characterized how bpd features predicts emotional
reactivity and emotion regulation behaviors in response to
interpersonal stress relative to other forms of stress.

methods

participants were 152 university students who completed
baseline measures of bpd features and complied with two-
week daily diary procedures assessing daily emotion
regulation strategy use in response to social and non-social
baseline measures of bpd features and complied with two-
week daily diary procedures assessing daily emotion
regulation strategy use in response to social and non-social
stressors.
