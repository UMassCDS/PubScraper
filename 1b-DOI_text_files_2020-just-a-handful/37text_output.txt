4. conclusions

in this study, we showed that multilayer emulsions could be
formed by sequential adsorption of anionic emulsifier,
cationic polypeptide, and anionic polysaccharide layers onto
the surfaces of lipid droplets. our original hypothesis was,
that the multilayer emulsions would have better resistance to
environmental stresses than the single-layer emulsions,
because they would generate stronger steric and electrostatic
that the multilayer emulsions would have better resistance to
environmental stresses than the single-layer emulsions,
because they would generate stronger steric and electrostatic
repulsion amongst the lipid droplets. in practice, we found
that lipid droplets coated by only quillaja saponin had the
best resistance to ph changes and salt addition. this effect
was mainly attributed to the fact that acid
addition weakened the electrostatic attraction between the
cationic polylysine molecules and the underlying anionic
saponin-coated droplets, which promoted droplet
flocculation through charge neutralization and bridging
flocculation. the presence of an outer polysaccharide layer in
the tertiary emulsions improved their stability compared to
the secondary emulsions, but they were still not as stable as
the primary emulsions. all of the emulsions were relatively
stable to thermal processing.

can be formed from the cationic polypeptide and two anionic

advantage over single-layer emulsions in terms of their
resistance to environmental stresses. in future studies, we
intend to determine whether forming these multilayer
coatings may have advantages in terms of other functional
attributes, such as their ability to inhibit lipid oxidation.

3.4.3. thermal-stability

the thermal stability of the emulsions was determined by
measuring their charge, size, and appearance before and after
heating at 90°c for 30min, and then cooling back to ambient
temperature (fig. 8). these heating conditions were selected
measuring their charge, size, and appearance before and after
heating at 90°c for 30min, and then cooling back to ambient
temperature (fig. 8). these heating conditions were selected
to represent thermal conditions that may be used in some
food processing operations. in general, it is important to
study the precise thermal conditions that a specific food or
beverage product experiences, such as pasteurization (e.g.,
63°c for 30min or 72°c for 15s) (cabrera et al., 2009). the
thermal processing conditions used in our study were more
severe than typical pasteurization conditions and therefore if
the samples were stable to these conditions, then they should
also be stable to commercial pasteur
change in the ¢-potential, mean particle diameter, or
appearance of the emulsions after the thermal treatment,
which suggested that they all had good heat stability. this
phenomenon is attributed to the relatively strong steric and
electrostatic repulsion between the droplets under these
conditions, i., ph 4 and no added salt.

primary emulsions: the saponin-coated lipid droplets in the
primary emulsions remained negatively charged at all salt
concentrations tested (fig. 6a.). however, the magnitude of
the ¢-potential diminished as the ionic strength was raised
due to accumulation of cationic counter-ions (na*) around
the anionic groups on the lipid droplet surfaces (mcclements,
2015). the size of the particles in the primary emulsions
increased slightly as the salt concentration was increased
(fig. 6b), which is indicative of droplet aggregation promoted

by a reduction in the electrostatic repulsion between the lipid
droplets. the primary emulsions were relatively stable to
creaming up to 200mm nacl, but then underwent rapid
creaming at higher salt levels (fig. 6c). this suggests that the
droplets may have formed large flocs that creamed rapidly,
but that were broken down when the emulsions were diluted
for the light scattering experiments.

secondary emulsions: the ¢-potential of the secondary
emulsions went from highly positive in the absence of salt to
slightly negative in the presence of any level of added salt,
ie., 50-350 nacl (fig. 6a). the charge on the secondary
emulsions at these high salt levels was similar to the
corresponding primary emulsions. these results suggest that
the presence of even low levels of salt were enough to cause
the cationic pll molecules to be displaced from the surfaces
of the saponin-coated lipid droplets. in the presence of any
level of salt, the secondary emulsions underwent extensive
aggregation and rapid creaming (fig. 6b and c). the primary
emulsions were relatively stable to creaming from 50 to
200mm nacl, whereas the secondary emulsions were highly

emulsions were relatively stable to creaming from 50 to
200mm nacl, whereas the secondary emulsions were highly
unstable. this suggests that the pll molecules may have been
weakly attached to the saponin-coated droplets in the
secondary emulsions and promoted bridging flocculation.
similar results were obtained in our previous study with a
related system (mundo et al., 2020).

 

 

tertiary emulsions: there was a progressive decrease in the
magnitude of the negative ¢-potential on both tertiary
emulsions as the salt concentration was increased (fig. ga),
which is attributed to electrostatic screening effects. in
addition, there may have been some desorption of the
polysaccharides (and possibly polypeptides) from the lipid
droplet surfaces due to the weakening of the electrostatic
attraction between the cationic polypeptide and anionic
polysaccharide layers. in general, the magnitude of the ¢-
potential was higher in the tertiary emulsions containing
carrageenan than in the ones containing pectin, which may
have been due to the higher charge density of the
carrageenan molecules. there were some differences in the
carrageenan than in the ones containing pectin, which may
have been due to the higher charge density of the
carrageenan molecules. there were some differences in the
impact of salt on the stability of the two tertiary emulsions.
both emulsions were relatively stable to droplet aggregation
and creaming at relatively low salt levels (0 to 100mm), but
exhibited extensive creaming at higher salt levels (fig. 6b and
c). this was surprising because there actually appeared to be
a decrease in the mean particle diameter in the tertiary
emulsions containing pectin at high salt levels (fig. 6b). this
effect may have been because the pectin layer, and possibly
also the pll layer, may have been displaced from the lipid
droplet surfaces due to weakening of the electrostatic
attraction between the biopolymer molecules in the
multilayer coatings. as a result, there was a decrease in
particle size, but the droplets were not stable to aggregation
and creaming.

icroscopy images of the emulsions in the presence
of 0. and 150mm nacl were also acquired to examine the
impact of the interfacial layers on the aggregation stability of
the lipid droplets (fig. 7). these images showed that the
primary emulsion was relatively stable to droplet aggregation
at this salt level, whereas all of the multilayer emulsions were
highly unstable. overall, these results show that the
aggregation and creaming stability of this kind of multilayer
emulsion is highly sensitive to salt.

secondary emulsions: the lipid droplets in the secondary
emulsions exhibited very different behavior to those in the
primary emulsions when the ph was changed. the ¢-
potential of the lipid droplets was strongly positive at ph 4
and 5 but decreased in magnitude as the ph was either
lowered or raised. the decrease observed upon lowering the
ph is ascribed to the saponin-coated lipid droplets losing
their negative charge and so the cationic pll molecules no
longer adsorbed to the droplet surfaces. conversely, the
decrease observed upon increasing the ph is caused by amino
groups on the pll molecules becoming partly deprotonated
above their pk, values and therefore losing their positive
charge.

moreover, the secondary emulsions appeared to be stable to
aggregation and creaming from ph 9 to 3 but aggregated
appreciably at ph 2. the aggregation observed under the
most acidic conditions is attributed to the fact that the pll
molecules had desorbed from the surfaces of the saponin-
coated lipid droplets. as a result, they behaved in a similar
manner as those in the primary emulsions. the aggregation
molecules had desorbed from the surfaces of the saponin-
coated lipid droplets. as a result, they behaved in a similar
manner as those in the primary emulsions. the aggregation
stability of the lipid droplets in the secondary emulsions at
all higher ph values, even though they had very different
surface potentials, is probably because the saponin-pll layer
generated a strong steric repulsion between the droplets.

tertiary emulsions: the electrical characteristics of the
droplets in both tertiary emulsions were similar across the
entire ph range. the droplets had a high negative charge from
ph 9 to 4, but a relatively low one from ph 3 to 2 (fig. 5a).
the anionic nature of the droplets at higher ph values are
attributed to the outer layer of negatively charged
polysaccharide molecules. the reduction in the magnitude of
the ¢-potential at lower ph values may have been because the
adsorbed polysaccharides lost some of their negative charge
and/or because they fully or partially desorbed from the lipid
droplet surfaces. the anionic groups on the pectin molecules
(carboxyl, pk:=3.5) would be expected to become protonated
at a higher ph than those on the carrageenan molecules
a¥oplét siittaces 1he anionic groups on thie pectin moleciiles
(carboxyl, pk:=3.5) would be expected to become protonated
at a higher ph than those on the carrageenan molecules
(sulfate, pk3=2.0). however, the charge on the droplets was
similar in both tertiary emulsions, suggesting that this effect
was not particularly important. therefore, it seems likely, that
the multilayers were fully or partially dissociated from the
droplet surfaces under highly acidic conditions.

despite the similarities in their ¢-ph characteristics, there
were appreciable differences in the dependence of the
particle size and creaming of the two tertiary emulsions on
ph (fig. sb). both emulsions were relatively stable to droplet
aggregation at high ph values, which is attributed to the
strong electrostatic and steric repulsion between the 3-layer
coated droplets. the emulsion with an outer carrageenan
layer only aggregated and creamed at ph 2, whereas those
with a pectin outer layer aggregated and creamed from ph 2
to 4, indicating that they were less stable under acidic
conditions. this may have been because the pectin was
attached to the lipid droplets less strongly than the

conditions. this may have been because the pectin was
attached to the lipid droplets less strongly than the

sharing of individual polysaccharide molecules amongst a
number of droplets.

 

3.4.2. salt-stability

in these experiments, the impact of salt addition on the
stability of the lipid droplets in the primary, secondary, and
tertiary emulsions was assessed (fig. 6). our hypothesis was
that the presence of the mineral ions would screen any
electrostatic interactions in the system. these interactions
may have been between the various charged surfactants and
biopolymers in the multilayer coatings, as well as between
the different lipid droplets. the ionic strength of the aqueous
solution surrounding the lipid droplets was increased by
adding increasing amounts of salt (0-350mm nacl).

3.4.1. ph-stability

primary emulsions: for the primary emulsions, the ¢-potential
was strongly negative from ph 9 to 4 but was close to zero
from ph 3 to 2 (fig. 5a). this effect is attributed to
progressive protonation of the carboxylic acid groups on the
adsorbed quillaja saponin molecules when the ph was
reduced below their pk, value, which would be expected to
be around ph 3.5 (yang, leser, sher, & mcclements, 2013).
the mean particle diameter of the primary emulsions was
relatively low from ph 9 to 3 but increased appreciably at ph
2 (fig. 5b). moreover, these emulsions were relatively stable
to creaming from ph 9 to 3 but exhibited extensive creaming
at ph 2 (fig. 5c). the instability of the emulsions to creaming
at the lowest ph is attributed to a reductic
electrostatic repulsion between the saponin-coated droplets,
which should promote droplet aggregation. droplet

at the lowest ph is attributed to a reduction in the
electrostatic repulsion between the saponin-coated droplets,
which should promote droplet aggregation. droplet
aggregation and creaming were also expected to occur at ph
3 because the ¢-potential was also relatively low under these
conditions. this suggests that some other factor may also
have contributed to the instability of the emulsions at ph 2.
for instance, the ester bond holding the hydrophilic sugar
groups to the non-polar regions of the saponin molecules
could have been hydrolyzed under acidic conditions (cleland
et al,, 1996), thereby reducing the steric repulsion between
the droplets.

 
3.4. impact of environmental conditions on
multilayers’ stability

in these experiments, the resistance of the primary,
secondary, and tertiary emulsions to changes in ph, salt
addition, and heating was determined. all the emulsions
were diluted to the same final oil level (1.0% w/v) so they
could be compared at a similar droplet concentration. the
particle size, charge, and microstructure of each emulsion
was then analyzed after being subjected to these
compra sheeees sumer aropiee couccuurac
particle size, charge, and microstructure of each emulsion
was then analyzed after being subjected to these
environmental stresses.

 
the dependence of the particle size on polysaccharide
concentration was also similar for both pectin and x-
carrageenan (fig. 3b). extensive droplet aggregation was
observed at intermediate polysaccharide concentrations,
where the net charge was close to zero, which is attributed to
charge neutralization and bridging effects. at sufficiently high
observed at intermediate polysaccharide concentrations,
where the net charge was close to zero, which is attributed to
charge neutralization and bridging effects. at sufficiently high
concentrations, however, relatively small coated lipid
droplets were formed for both polysaccharides (d3=0.47 pm).
the overall appearance of the tertiary emulsions also
indicated that they tended to undergo rapid creaming at
intermediate polysaccharide concentrations (fig. 3c), which
is consistent with an increase in particle size due to droplet
aggregation. conversely, tertiary emulsions that appeared
fairly homogeneous were formed at sufficiently high
polysaccharide concentrations, suggesting that they were
relatively stable to aggregation and creaming.

the surface load of the polysaccharides used to form the
outer layers of the tertiary emulsions was calculated using
the same model discussed earlier (fig. 4). for pectin, the csat
value that gave the best fit between the experimental
measurements and the theoretical predictions was 0.00330
w/v% (fig. 4a), which corresponds to a surface load of around
1.1mgm. for k-carrageenan, the csar value that gave the best
iéasurements and the theoretical predictions was 0.00330°
w/v% (fig. 4a), which corresponds to a surface load of around
1.1mgm. for k-carrageenan, the csar value that gave the best
it between the experimental measurements and theoretical
predictions was 0.0027 w/v% (fig. 4b), which corresponds to
a surface load of around 0.90mgm”?. for both calculations, it
was assumed that the disperse phase volume fraction was
0.02 (2% oil droplets) and the mean droplet diameter (d32)
was 0.40ym (the measured size of the droplets in the
secondary emulsions at saturation). taken together, these
results show that the lipid droplets can by successfully nano-
laminated using food-grade ingredients, such as saponins,
polypeptides, and polysaccharides.

the impact of the pll concentration on the size of the
particles in the secondary emulsions was also measured (fig.
2b). ideally, we aimed to form secondary emulsions
containing small non-aggregated lipid droplets. initially, the
saponin-coated lipid droplets had a relatively small size
(d32=0.20ym), because the saponin molecules adsorb rapidly
to the droplet surfaces during homogenization and stabilize
them against aggregation. when small amounts of the pll
were added, the droplet size remained small, presumably
because there was still a high enough negative charge to
inbihitdrantet flocgulatian, hawevns there wvas alarees
were added, the droplet size remained small, presumably
because there was still a high enough negative charge to
inhibit droplet flocculation. however, there was a large
increase in droplet size at intermediate pll concentrations,
which is attributed to charge neutralization and bridging
flocculation. at sufficiently high pll concentrations, the
droplet size decreased again, because the lipid droplets were
completely covered by biopolymer and had a strong net
positive charge. as a result, there was a strong electrostatic
and steric repulsion between the droplets, which inhibited
their aggregation.

the overall appearance of the secondary emulsions after
storage was consistent with the particle size measurements.
the emulsions were stable to creaming at low and high pll
concentrations but underwent rapid creaming at
intermediate values. this effect is attributed to droplet
aggregation, which increases the effective particle size,
thereby increasing the magnitude of the gravitational forces
acting upon the lipid droplets.

thereby increasing the magnitude of the gravitational forces
acting upon the lipid droplets.

based on these results, a pll concentration of 0.01 w/v% was
used to form the secondary emulsions in the subsequent
experiments. these droplets had a high positive charge
(around+40mv) and a small diameter (around 0.4ym).

3.3. optimization of tertiary emulsion formation

tertiary emulsions were formed by electrostatic deposition of
anionic pectin or x-carrageenan onto the surfaces of the
cationic pll-saponin-coated lipid droplets (ph 4.0). similar
trends were observed for both polysaccharides (fig. 3). the ¢-
potential on the lipid droplets went from highly positive to
highly negative as the polysaccharide concentration in both
tertiary emulsions was increased (fig. 3a), indicating that the
anionic polysaccharide molecules had adsorbed to the
surfaces of the cationic lipid droplets. for both systems, the
surfaces of the lipid droplets became saturated around 0.03%
w/v polysaccharide. at saturation, the ¢-potential was more
strongly negative for the lipid droplets coated by x-

surfaces of the lipid droplets became saturated around 0.03%
w/v polysaccharide. at saturation, the ¢-potential was more
strongly negative for the lipid droplets coated by x-
carrageenan (-48mv) than by pectin (-41 mv), which is
attributed to the higher charge density of the carrageenan
molecules.

3.2. optimization of secondary emulsion
formation

in our previous study, we found that lipid droplets coated
with saponin-pll layers could be formed at ph 4 (mundo et
al., 2020). in this series of experiments, our aim was to
establish the pll concentration required to saturate the
surfaces of the saponin-coated droplets, without having a
high level of free pll in the surrounding aqueous phase
(guzey and mcclements, 2006, giizey and mcclements,
2006, von goeler and muthukumar, 1994). any excess
cationic pll might bind to the anionic polysaccharides used
(cfeey sha tavérenems! dope, gazey aintafeciements, ro"
2006, von goeler and muthukumar, 1994). any excess
cationic pll might bind to the anionic polysaccharides used
to form the tertiary emulsions, thereby interfering with their
ability to successfully coat the lipid droplets.

as the pll concentration was increased, the -potential on
the lipid droplets went from highly negative (-42mv) to
highly positive (+35mv), which is consistent with the
adsorption of the cationic polypeptides onto the surfaces of
the anionic saponin-coated droplets (fig. 2a). the ¢-potential
reached a relatively constant positive value when the pll
concentration exceeded about 0.01%, which suggests that
saturation occurred somewhere around this value. a more
quantitative analysis was carried out by fitting the following

initially, the optimum concentration of quillaja saponin
required to form the primary emulsions was established
using ¢-potential and particle size measurements. ideally, the
emulsifier concentration should be high enough to create
small oil droplets during homogenization but not so high that
there is a high concentration of free emulsifier in the aqueous
phase (mundo et al., 2020). if there is too much free
emulsifier, then it will interfere with the formation of the
next layer by forming electrostatic complexes. the change in
the surface potential of the lipid droplets with increasing
saponin concentration was measured by
microelectrophoresis (fig. 1a). the magnitude of the ¢-
potential remained relatively high and constant for all
saponin concentrations applied, suggesting that the droplet
surfaces were always completely covered by the surfactant.
nevertheless, there was a noticeable decrease in lipid droplet
size with increasing saponin concentration (fig. 1b), which
can be attributed to the fact that a greater surface area of oil
can be covered at higher surfactant concentrations. based on
these experiments, a saponin concentration of 1.0% w/v was

3. results & discussions
2.6. microstructural analysis

confocal scanning fluorescence laser microscopy was used to
characterize the structural organization of the lipid droplets
within the emulsions (nikon d-eclipse c1 80i, nikon,
melville, ny, us). prior to analysis, a fixed volume (200pl) of
emulsion was mixed with a fixed volume (10pl) of nile red
within the emulsions (nikon d-eclipse c1 80i, nikon,
melville, ny, us). prior to analysis, a fixed volume (200pl) of
emulsion was mixed with a fixed volume (10pl) of nile red
solution (1 mg/ml ethanol) to dye the oil droplets. an
appropriate emission wavelength (543nm) and excitation
wavelength (605nm) was used to detect the nile red.

 

 

 

2.7. statistical analysis

all data were collected from at least three separate
experiments with three measurements per sample. the
results were then combined, and the mean and standard
deviation calculated using excel (microsoft, redmond, va,
usa).
2.4. environmental stress tests

 

initially, the primary, secondary, and tertiary emulsions were
diluted with ph-adjusted distilled water or salt solution (ph
4,0), so that they had the same final oil droplet concentration
(1.0 w/v). the influence of ph, salt addition, and heating on
diluted with ph-adjusted distilled water or salt solution (ph
4,0), so that they had the same final oil droplet concentration
(1.0 w/v). the influence of ph, salt addition, and heating on
the stability of the emulsions was then examined using the
same conditions described previously (mundo et al., 2020). in
summary, the emulsions were exposed to different ph values
(2-9), salt concentrations (0-350mm nacl), and heating
conditions (90°c, 30min). after each treatment, the
emulsions were stored for 24h at ambient temperature
before being analyzed.

 

 

2.5. surface potential and particle size
measurements

microelectrophoresis and light scattering were used to
determine the surface potential and particle size of the lipid
droplets in the emulsions as described previously (mundo et
al., 2020). the ¢-potential was measured by electrophoresis
(zetasizer nano-zs, malvern instruments, malvern,
worcestershire, uk) while the mean particle diameter was
measured by laser diffraction (mastersizer 3000, malvern
(2etaser nand" wrivenrninstuitedty malveiles ter or
worcestershire, uk) while the mean particle diameter was
measured by laser diffraction (mastersizer 3000, malvern
instruments). all samples were diluted with distilled water or
salt solution (adjusted to the required ph) prior to analysis to
ensure optimized light scattering conditions for reliable
measurements. in the salt-addition experiments, the
emulsions were diluted with salt solutions (ph 4.0) with the
same ionic strength as for the ¢-potential measurements, but
with distilled water (ph 4.0) for the particle size
measurements (because of the large volume of water
required). all measurements were conducted on at least two
freshly prepared samples and repeated three times per
sample.

 

 
2.2. solution preparation

all solutions were prepared at ambient temperature, unless
stated otherwise. the aqueous emulsifier solutions were
prepared by dispersing quillaja saponin (0.5-3.0% w/w) in

led water adjusted to ph 4.0 and stirring for at least 1h.
an aqueous pll solution was prepared by dispersing 0.1% w/v
of powdered epsilon-poly-l-lysine into double distilled water
and then stirring continuously for at least 2h. an aqueous
pectin solution was prepared by dispersing 0.4% w]v of
powdered pectin into distilled water and stirring for at least
2h. aqueous x-carrageenan solutions were prepared by

temperature, and then stirring for at least another 1h. finally,
all of the biopolymer solutions were adjusted to ph 4.0 using
naoh and/or hci solutions (0.1m).

2.3. emulsion preparation

emulsions were prepared using the same method described
in our previous article (mundo et al., 2020), and so only a
brief description is given here with any modifications
described.

primary emulsions: oil-in-water emulsions were prepared by
homogenizing 10wt% oil phase with 90wt% aqueous
emulsifier solution (ph 4.0). the oil and water phases were
blended together using a high-shear mixer and then passed
through a high-pressure microfluidizer (12,000 psi, 3 passes)
to form small anionic saponin-coated lipid droplets. at the
end of this process, the pri is were adjusted _

through a high-pressure microfluidizer (12,000 psi, 3 passes)
to form small anionic saponin-coated lipid droplets. at the
end of this process, the primary emulsions were adjusted
back to ph 4.0, if required. initially, a range of saponin
concentrations (0.5-3.0% w/v) was used to establish the
optimum emulsifier concentration to formulate the primary
emulsions. the optimum saponin concentration (0.1% w/v)
for further studies was then selected based on the ¢-potential
and particle size data: this concentration gave small highly
charged droplets at a relatively low emulsifier concentration.

secondary emulsions: secondary emulsions were prepared by
adding a fixed volume (2ml) of primary emulsion (ph 4.0)
into a fixed volume of (8ml) of pll solution (ph 4.0) with
constant mixing. a series of pll solutions with different
polypeptide concentrations (0-0.025%, w/v) were used in this
experiment to establish the surface saturation concentration
of the pll. the final solutions therefore contained 2 w/v% oil
droplets and 0 to 0.02 w/v% pll. the secondary emulsions
were then stored for 24h to allow pll to bind onto the qs-
coated oil droplet surfaces.

tertiary emulsions: tertiary emulsions were formed by adding
sml of secondary emulsion (ph 4.0) to sml of aqueous
polysaccharide solution (ph 4.0) and then mixing. the
polysaccharide solutions contained a range of pectin (0 to
0.2%) or x-carrageenan concentrations (0 to 0.15%) so that the
surface saturation concentrations of the polysaccharides
could be established. the final systems contained 1 w/v% oil
droplets and 0 to 0.075 w/v% (kc) or 0 to 0.080 w/v% (pe)

at ambient temperature for 24h to allow them to come to

2. materials and methods
1. introduction

there has been great interest in improving or extending the
functional properties of emulsions by coating the lipid
droplets with coatings consisting of numerous layers of
ferent biopolymers (bortnowska, 2015, chuah et al., 2009,

 

 

fiinctional properties of émulsions by coating the fipid~
droplets with coatings consisting of numerous layers of
different biopolymers (bortnowska, 2015, chuah et al., 2009,
dickinson and pawlowsky, 1997, giizey and mcclements,
2006). the stability and functionality of these multilayer
emulsions can be tuned by careful selection of the type,
number, and sequence of biopolymer molecules within the
coatings. (giizey and mcclements, 2006, ogawa et al., 2003).
coating oil droplets using the layer-by-layer (lbl) deposition
method has been shown to have many potential benefits for
food applications, including the ability to control or trigger
the release of encapsulated components, the ability to
improve the resistance of emulsions to processing and
storage conditions (such as ph changes, salt addition, heating,
freezing, and dehydration), and the ability to modulate the
igestibility of lipids within the gastrointestinal tract (evans

 

et al., 2013, grigoriev and miller, 2009, guzey and
mcclements, 2006). furthermore, multilayer coatings can be
designed to retard lipid oxidation in emulsions due to their

 

ability to alter both the charge and thickness of the interfacial
layer around the oil droplets (lesmes et al., 2010, shaw et al.,

  

désighed fo retard lipid oxidation in emulsioiis due to their
ability to alter both the charge and thickness of the interfacial
layer around the oil droplets (lesmes et al., 2010, shaw et al.,
2007). the electrical properties of the first layer of a
multilayer emulsion are determined by the emulsifier, and
they can therefore be controlled by selecting different types
of emulsifier (burgos-diaz et al., 2016, zhou et al., 2008).
these multilayer coatings can be assembled from food-grade
charged emulsifiers and biopolymers, like ionic surfactants,
phospholipids, proteins, or polysaccharides, using a
sequential electrostatic deposition method (bortnowska,
2015, carpenter et al., 2019, hamidon et al., 2019, zang et al.,
2019). however, the selection of the most appropriate
combination of coating materials is critical to forming a
stable system with the desired functional attributes
(mcclements, 2014).

in this study, we used an anionic plant-based food-grade
surfactant, quillaja saponin (qs), to form the first layer
around the lipid droplets. a cationic polypeptide, epsilon-

 

 

around the lipid droplets. a cationic polypeptide, epsilon-
poly-l-lysine (pll), was then used to form the second layer
because it has a strong positive charge across a wide ph
range, since the amino groups have pk, values around 10
(ball et al., 2009, chang et al., 2011, chang et al., 2014, shih et
al., 2006). the ability of cationic pll to coat anionic saponin-
coated lipid droplets was recently demonstrated in our
earlier study (mundo, zhou, tan, liu, & mcclements, 2020).
the resulting 2-layer emulsions contained cationic droplets,
but they were highly unstable to aggregation when exposed
to environmental stresses, such as ph changes and salt
addition. this is because counterions, such as h*, oh”, na* or
cl, can bind to oppositely charged groups on the surfactants
or polymers, thereby weakening the molecular interactions
holding the multilayers together. for this reason, we
examined the possibility of improving the functional
performance of these 2-layer emulsions by further coating
the droplets with an anionic polysaccharide using the
saturation method (mundo et al., 2020). in this method, just
enough polysaccharide is included in the aqueous phase to
comoletelv.cover all of.the.droplen.surfaces. thereby leaving
saturation method (mundo et al., 2020). in this method, just
enough polysaccharide is included in the aqueous phase to
completely cover all of the droplet surfaces, thereby leaving
little free polysaccharide in the system. the presence of any
free polysaccharide could interfere with the formation of any
subsequent layers or promote depletion flocculation. we
examined the potential of two different anionic
polysaccharides, pectin (pe) and x-carrageenan (kc), to form
the outer layer around the lipid droplets.

 

pectin is a branched polysaccharide with a linear backbone
containing many ionizable carboxylic acid groups (pk, = 3.5),
as well as numerous “hairy regions” consisting neutral side
chains extending from the backbone (leroux et al., 2003,
maroziene and de kruif, 2000). «-carrageenan is a linear
polysaccharide with many sulfate groups (pk, ~ 2.0)
providing a strong negative charge across a broad range of ph
values (dickinson and pawlowsky, 1997, gu et al., 2005, sun
et al., 2020). we hypothesized that the ability of these two
polysaccharides to form and stabilize multilayer emulsions
would be different based on the distinct differences in their
et al., 2020). we hypothesized that the ability of these two
polysaccharides to form and stabilize multilayer emulsions
would be different based on the distinct differences in their
molecular characteristics. this knowledge could then be used
to select the most appropriate polysaccharide to use in food
applications where products are often exposed to alterations
in ph, ionic strength, or temperature during their
manufacture, storage or utilization.

negatively charged lipid droplets was created using quillaja
saponin (qs) as an anionic emulsifier. second, these anionic

cationic droplets were coated with a negatively-charged
polysaccharide, either pectin (pe) or x-carrageenan (kc), to
form anionic droplets. overall, the 1-layer emulsions had the
best resistance to salt, ph, and heat, indicating that quillaja
saponins were effective emulsifiers. the 2-layer emulsions
had better ph-stability than the 3-layer emulsions, which
tended to strongly aggregate under acidic conditions.
conversely, the 3-layer emulsions had better salt-stability
than the 2-layer emulsions, which tended to aggregate
strongly even at low salt levels (50-100mm nacl). all the
emulsions were relatively stable to heating (90°c, 30min).
