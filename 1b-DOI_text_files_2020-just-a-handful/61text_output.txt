in summary, our results show that both high-intensity
ultrasound and high-pressure homogenization can be used to
prepare nanocellulose ingredients from okara with improved
functional performance, such as thickening, gelling, and
thermal stability. the mean particle diameter and
polydispersity decreased, while the ¢-potential and swelling
ratio increased, when the strength of the mechanical
treatment was raised (e.g., increased duration or intensity of
the disruptive forces). of the treatment conditions tested,
sonication at 600 w for 15 min led to the smallest mean.
particle diameter, lowest polydispersity, and highest swelling
ratio. overall, this study showed that either sonication or
homogenization could be used to create functional
nanocellulose ingredients with tunable properties. the use of
okara to prepare high performance nanocellulose to achieve
high value utilization of agricultural waste provides new
ideas and new methods for the preparation of nanocellulose.

3.7. scanning electron microscope analysis

the impact of sonication and homogenization on the
microstructure of the okara cellulose was assessed using
electron microscopy (fig. 6). compared with non-treated
cellulose, the microstructure of okara cellulose changed
significantly after ultrasonic and high-pressure
homogenization. the non-treated cellulose contained
irregular fibrous structures and smooth surface (fig. 5a~c).
after either sonication or homogenization, these relatively
thick cellulose fibers were disrupted and thinner fibers (fig.
5d-h). meanwhile, the mechanical treatments also appeared
to have caused some surface erosion ("fluffing”) of the
surfaces of the cellulose fibers (fig. 5d and g), the electron
microscopy images also indicated that the fibers in the
cellulose samples were agglomerated, which was probably
caused by strong hydrogen bonding between the cellulose
fihcrostopy atkges mstrnacacatorcine versie"
cellulose samples were agglomerated, which was probably
caused by strong hydrogen bonding between the cellulose
fibers during the sample preparation process, which involves
a drying step (wang et al., 2018), overall, the electron
microscopy analysis indicated that both sonication and
homogenization were effective at disintegrating the okara
cellulose.

 
after mechanical treatment, the main thermal decomposition
range of the okara cellulose increased, and the temperature at
which the maximum weight loss value occurred increased
(fig. 5b). for sonication, the initial pyrolysis temperature
increased from 212 to 224 °c, while the pyrolysis residue
decreased from 26 % to 12 %. these effects can be attributed
to a number of phenomena: (i) sonication increased the
increased from 212 to 224 °c, while the pyrolysis residue
decreased from 26 % to 12 %. these effects can be attributed
to a number of phenomena: (i) sonication increased the
crystallinity of the cellulose (as discussed earlier), which
meant that it had to be heated to a higher temperature before
breaking down (lin et al., 2020); (ii) sonication reduced the
amount of pectin, hemicellulose, and lignin in the samples,
thereby increasing their thermal stability (ilyas et al., 2019);
(iii) sonication increased the surface area and surface
hydroxyl content of the cellulose, thereby making it easier to
volatilize once heated above the pyrolysis temperature (wu
et al., 2020, yang et al., 2019). compared to the sonicated
sample, the homogenized sample had a narrower main
pyrolysis range and the higher residue content, which may be
due to differences in their fine structure. after the whole
thermal decomposition process, the pyrolysis residue content
of non-treated, sonicated, and homogenized samples were 22
%, 8%, and 19 %, respectively. the greater final residue content
of the non-treated cellulose can be attributed to its larger
particle size and lower surface area, which would have

ited the volatilization process (ullah et al., 2018).

of the non-treated cellulose can be attributed to its larger
particle size and lower surface area, which would have
inhibited the volatilization process (ullah et al., 2018).

both the storage and loss modulus (g' and g”) of all the
samples increased with increasing frequency and the storage
modulus was always higher than the loss modulus (fig. 4).
these results are consistent with a cellulose suspension in
which the elastic properties dominate the viscous properties
(cespi, bonacucina, mencarelli, casettari, & palmieri, 2011;
ding, huang, pang, duan, & zhang, 2018). the g' and g”
values of the sonicated and the homogenized cellulose
suspensions were significantly higher than those of the non-
ding, huang, pang, duan, & zhang, 2018). the g' and g”
values of the sonicated and the homogenized cellulose
suspensions were significantly higher than those of the non-
treated samples, indicating that these mechanical treatments
enhanced both the elastic (solid) and viscous (liquid)
properties of the system. this phenomenon has been
attributed to an increase in the number of cellulose
nanofibers present after mechanical treatment, which greatly
enhances the hydrogen bonding between them (ma et al.,
2019), notably, the g' and g” values decreased slightly under
the most extreme sonication (2600 w, 15 min) and
homogenization (2120 mpa) conditions used, suggesting that
over-processing may disrupt the nanofibers and reduce their
structure forming ability (yang, liu, li, & tang, 2019).

3.6. thermal stability analysis

the impact of sonication and homogenization on the thermal
stability of okara cellulose was studied by thermogravimetric
analysis (fig. 5a).the cellulose sample exhibited three main
weight-loss stages during heating. the first stage occurred
from around 25-150 °c, which has been attributed to the
analysis (fig. 5a).the cellulose sample exhibited three main
weight-loss stages during heating. the first stage occurred
from around 25-150 °c, which has been attributed to the
evaporation of any adsorbed water and the thermal
degradation of small and medium molecular weight
components (taflick, schwendler, rosa, bica, & nachtigall,
2017). the second stage occurred from around 210-500 °c,
which has been attributed to pyrolysis of cellulose (ilyas et
al,, 2019). in this stage, the mass loss was the greatest and a
lot of heat was released due to the breaking and
rearrangement of chemical bonds of the cellulose molecules
caused by thermal depolymerization, decomposition and
dehydration. the third stage occurred from around 500-800
°c, which can be attributed to the volatilization of the
remaining residue.

3.5. rheological property analysis

the impact of sonication and homogenization on the
theological properties of aqueous suspensions of the okara
cellulose was also assessed (fig. 4). the apparent shear
viscosity versus shear rate profiles of all the cellulose
suspensions showed distinct shear-thinning behavior, with a
steep drop in viscosity as the shear rate was increased. shear
thinning may have occurred due to the rupture of weak
attractive bonds between the nanofibers or the alignment of
the nanofibers with the shear field. ata fixed shear rate, the
thinning may have occurred due to the rupture of weak
attractive bonds between the nanofibers or the alignment of
the nanofibers with the shear field. ata fixed shear rate, the
apparent viscosity of both the sonicated and homogenized
cellulose suspensions increased with increasing treatment
strength (ie,, higher intensity or longer time). nevertheless,
the viscosity of the sonicated samples was significantly
greater than that of the homogenized samples. the observed
increase in viscosity after the two mechanical treatments can
be attributed to the generation of a greater number of fibrils
when the cellulose structure is degraded. as a result, the
effective volume fraction of the disperse phase in the
cellulose suspension increased, leading to a higher viscosity
(qietal., 2016), presumably, more nanofibers were formed by
sonication, as demonstrated by their smaller dimensions.

analysis
the xps spectra of okara cellulose before and after

mechanical treatment were displayed in fig. 3. obviously, the
samples of oxygen carbon ratio (o/c) were near at 0.68,

 

cellulose macromolecules did not change significantly after
mechanical treatment of ultrasonic or high-pressure
homogenization. the peaks near at 285, 286 and 289 ev in
the c; s spectra (fig. 3ia, b and c) of okara cellulose can be
assigned to c—h and cc, coh and oco————,
respectively (dorris & gray, 1978). similarly, the peaks at
528.5 and 532.5 in the o; s spectra (fig. 31d, e and f) of okara
cellulose can be assigned to c—oh---o and co—h,
respectively. as shown in table 2, the type of chemical bond
of c; s in okara cellulose macromolecules remains unchanged
after ultrasonic or high pressure homogenization and the
relative content fluctuates, such as the relative content of c;
2 (c—oh) slightly increases (41%-43%). in addition, the
binding energies of the bonds closely related to hydrogen
hands (surhas craqhaed, 1com-a) showman increasint -,
2 (c—oh) slightly increases (41%-43%). in addition, the
ding energies of the bonds closely related to hydrogen
bonds (such as c—oh and oco——) show an increasing
trend, which may be due to the promotion of the binding
state of these bonds after mechanical treatment, which
effectively improves the chemical bond energy of cellulose
macromolecules. it is worth mentioning that the huge
hydrogen bond network formed by a large number of
hydroxyl groups in cellulose macromolecules directly leads to
the formation of dense structure with high crystallinity.

 

 

 

 

a
the characteristic peaks in the ft-ir spectra provided some
insights into the nature of the bonding in the okara cellulose.
there were broad absorption peaks at 3600-3200 cm” and
2899 cm respectively, which is linked to the o—h
stretching vibration groups and c—h bond in methyl and
methylene group presence of cellulose and hemicellulose
structures in the samples (wu et al., 2020). the absorption
peak at 1049 cm’! is caused by the stretching vibration of the
c—o and cc— bond in cellulose and the mixed vibration of
—oh bond in hemicellulose (jabli, tka, ramzi, & saleh, 2018;
tka, jabli, saleh, & salman, 2018). the absorption peaks
observed around 897 cm” are linked to the bending
vibration of the c—1 group and related to the amorphous
region of cellulose. an absorption peak at around 1391 cm™
is indicative of the presence of crystalline regions, which
could beattributed to lignin degradation. notably, no infrared

is indicative of the presence of crystalline regions, which
could beattributed to lignin degradation. notably, no infrared
peak was observed at 1540 cm"!, which suggests that none of
the okara cellulose samples contained protein (ma et al.,
2019; singh, gaikwad, park, & lee, 2017). the absorption
peaks at 1604 cm’! is the bending vibration peak of the h—
oh— group, which is the signal peak of adsorbed water in
cellulose sample.

3.3. x-ray diffraction analysis (xrd) analysis

x-ray diffraction analysis was carried out to examine the
effect of sonication and homogenization on the crystal
structure and degree of crystallinity of okara cellulose (fig.
2b), strong peaks were observed at 28 diffraction angles of
13° and 23°, while a weak one was observed at 35’, indicating
that the okara cellulose contained both crystalline and
amorphous regions. the xrd patterns of both the sonicated
and the homogenized cellulose coincided closely with that of
the non-treated cellulose, suggesting that most of the
cellulosicfine structure was maintained after these

and the homogenized cellulose coincided closely with that of
the non-treated cellulose, suggesting that most of the
cellulosicfine structure was maintained after these
mechanical treatments (ullah et al., 2017), the crystallinity
index of the okara cellulose was estimated by comparing the
crystalline and total diffraction areas in the xrd patterns
(cleven, van den berg, & van der plas, 1978). the crystallinity
index was estimated to be around 70 % for the treated
cellulose and 60 % for the non-treated cellulose, which
suggests that part of the amorphous structure was
transformed into crystalline structure by sonication or
homogenization. meanwhile, it is also possible that the
increase in the crystallinity index is associated with the
transfer of the amorphous part of cellulose into solution. a
similar phenomenon has also been reported by other
researchers on cellulose after mechanical treatment (wang et
al., 2018).
3.2. fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ft-
ir) analysis

 

the impact of high-intensity ultrasound or high-pressure
homogenization treatments on the ft-ir spectra of okara
nanocellulose was investigated to provide some insights into
the nature of the molecular interactions involved (fig. 2a).
overall, all okara cellulose samples had fairly similar ft-ir
spectra after either of the mechanical treatments, but there
were some noticeable changes in the peak intensities for
several characteristic bands. these results show that the
characteristic functional groups of okara cellulose were not
destroyed by the intense disruptive forces (cavitation,
turbulence, and shear) associated with sonication or
homogenization.

the particle size, polydispersity index, and surface potential
values of okara nanocellulose samples prepared using
different methods were measured (table 1). the mean
particle diameter (2.43 pm) and polydispersity index (0.9) of
the non-treated okara cellulose (no homogenization or
sonication) were relatively large, which can be attributed to
the fact that the cellulose structure had not been adequately
disrupted. compared to the nanocellulose samples, the ¢-
potential of the non-treated cellulose samples was less highly
negatively charged (-25.6 mv), which may have been
because less surface groups were exposed. in addition, the
swelling ratio of the non-treated cellulose was significantly
lower than that of the nanocellulose samples. this effect may
have been because the magnitude of the capillary forces was
less in the non-treated sample because it consisted of fewer
but thicker fibers. moreover, its lower surface potential may
have reduced the amount of water molecules that bound to

 

its surface.

140 mpa (h).

after high-pressure ultrasound or high-pressure
homogenization treatments, the mean particle diameter and
polydispersity index decreased (table 1), which is consistent
with greater disruption of the cellulosic material by the
intense mechanical forces generated by these devices, such as
cavitation, turbulence, and shear forces. meanwhile, the
decreased polydispersity index also suggested that okara
cellulose became more uniform when higher power or longer
time ultrasound treatment was applied (li et al., 2020). the
treated samples had greater negative charges (~30 to -36
mv) than the non-treated ones (-26 mv), which may have
been because more anionic surface groups were exposed
when the cellulose nanofibers were released or because of
modifications in surface chemistry caused by the mechanical
treatments. there was also a substantial increase in the
swelling ratio of the cellulose after the mechanical
treatments, with the value increasing from around 3.8 to
around 5.8-76 (table 1). this effect can be attributed to the
fact that the number of fibers present would have increased,
treatments, with the value increasing from around 3.8 to
around 5.8-76 (table 1). this effect can be attributed to the
fact that the number of fibers present would have increased,
while their thickness would have decreased. as a result, they
could form a biopolymer network with smaller pores able to
hold more water via capillary forces.

of all the treatments, the production of nanocellulose using
sonication at 600 w for 15 min led to the smallest the mean
particle diameter (0.22 um) and polydispersity index (0.21),
and the highest swelling ratio (7.64). however, li et al. (2020)
indicated that cnfs with smaller z-average (27 nm) were
obtained using high pressure homogenization (60 mpa, 15
times) after pretreatment of okara with choline chloride
oxalic acid type solvent. the reason for this difference may be
due to li et al. (2020) using more times of high pressure
homogenization process and the potential chemical
degradation of cellulose by ionic liquids, resulting in higher
mechanical energy consumption. this treatment may
therefore have advantages for certain applications with low
cost processing of the nanocellulose.

the okara powder obtained was dispersed in distilled water

2. materials and methods
1. introduction

cellulose, which is a biopolymer composed of repeating
-1,4-glycoside-linked p-glucopyranose units, is an abundant
and renewable natural resource (xiao et al., 2020).
traditionally, cellulose-based ingredients have mainly been
used for a variety of purposes in the textile, paper, and fine
chemical industries, but more recently they are being
explored for their potential application in various other fields,
including the food, agricultural, pharmaceutical, medical,
envirnamantab ard, annrmundeevingy unep lb ue alg7h 207
explored for their potential application in various other fields,
including the food, agricultural, pharmaceutical, medical,
environmental, and energy industries (zhao, zhou, & zhang,
2019). in particular, there has been a major focus on the
preparation, characterization, and utilization of nanocellulose
as a functional ingredient. nanocellulose is a biodegradable
and renewable material that can be obtained in high purity,
which is characterized by a high aspect ratio, high young's
modulus, high crystallinity, high mechanical strength, and
low thermal expansion coefficient, which are beneficial
attributes for many commercial applications (nagano, arai,
yano, aoki, & nishinari, 2020). nanocellulose materials
obtained from different sources have been shown to have
istinctively different physical and chemical properties, such
as differences in their dimensions, specific surface areas,
water-dispersibilities, and rheological properties (abitbol et
al,, 2016). as a result, nanocellulose ingredients with different
functional attributes can be produced for different
applications.

 

  

one of the main challenges in this area has been to produce

applications.

one of the main challenges in this area has been to produce
nanocellulose ingredients with well-defined structural,
physiochemical, and functional properties from native
cellulose, which can mainly be attributed to the strong
hydrogen bonds between cellulose molecules and fibrils.
these hydrogen bonds must be disrupted in a controlled
manner to produce nanocellulose materials with the desired
properties. consequently, there is interest in developing
simple, inexpensive, and sustainable processing methods to
convert cellulosic resources into functional nanocellulose
ingredients suitable for commercial appli

 

tions.

 

traditionally, chemical and/or mechanical methods are
commonly used to prepare nanocellulose. the chemical
methods used typically involve controlled acid or enzymatic
hydrolysis of the cellulose (benini, voorwald, cioffi, rezende,

& afantes, 2018; ilyas, sapuan, sanyang, ishak, & zainudin,
2018). researchers have reported that nanocellulose with
good structural, physicochemical and functional properties
can be formed by acid hydrolysis (benini et al., 2018).
however, there are some potential disadvantages in using
this approach for the commercial production of
nanocellulose, including chemical degradation of the
cellulose, corrosion of processing equipment, environmental
damage, and safety issues. for this reason, there has been
interest in using safer and more environmentally-friendly
enzymatic methods. nanocellulose fibers produced by
enzymatic hydrolysis have been shown to have a higher
aspect ratio than those produced by acid hydrolysis, which
leads to improved performance in some applications (yassin,
gad, ghanem, & rehim, 2019).

the mechanical methods used to produce nanocellulose
include high-speed shearing, ball milling, ultrafine grinding,
microfluidization and homogenization (aklog et al., 2016;
llyas et al., 2018; ma et al., 2019). electrospinning has also
been used to prepare nanocellulose in the polymer and
matesialssciance gald.(dlabgi milad & sabie 202e
llyas et al., 2018; ma et al., 2019). electrospinning has also
been used to prepare nanocellulose in the polymer and
materials science field (mehri, milad, & sabihe, 2021).
recently, high-pressure homogenization and high-intensity
ultrasound have been reported to be effective mechanical
treatments to create nanocellulose (ilyas, sapuan, ishak, &
zainudin, 2019; raquel, silva, ekaette, el-bialy, & saldafia,
2020). high-pressure homogenization generates a number of
jisruptive forces that can partially disintegrate the structural
organization of cellulosic materials, including cavitation,
turbulence, and shear effects (ilyas et al., 2019). high
intensity ultrasound treatments can also break down
cellulosic materials by generating intense cavitation forces
(wang, yan, chang, ren, & zhou, 2018).

 

nanocellulose can be produced from a variety of agricultural
crop residues, including soy pods, rice straw, grape skins,
pineapple leaves, and cotton stalks (garcia, gandini, labidi,
belgacem, & bras, 2016; nagano & yano, 2020; nagano,
hirano, kurihara, & nishinari, 2020). as mentioned earlier,
the functional properties of the nanocellulose obtained
belgacem, & bras, 2016; nagano & yano, 2020; nagano,
hirano, kurihara, & nishinari, 2020). as mentioned earlier,
the functional properties of the nanocellulose obtained
depend on its biological origin, as well as the isolation
procedure employed (benini et al., 2018). okara, the residue
of the production of tofu and soybean milk, is rich in dietary
fibers (dfs) and phytochemical components such as cellulose.
at present, the world soybean processing volume (mainly
tofu and soybean milk production) is substantial, which
results in generation of considerable amounts of okara as a
byproduct (nsoratindana et al., 2020; changling et al., 2020).
meanwhile, most of okara is used as animal feed or burnt as
waste in asian countries (nagano, arai et al., 2020). thus, this
byproduct may be a good source of nanocellulose.

the aims of this study were, therefore, to isolate
nanocellulose from okara using a combination of
intensity ultrasound and high-pressure homogeni:
treatment, and then to characterize the effects of these

treatments on the molecular structure, microstructure,
thermal behavior, physicochemical properties, and functional
treatment, dnd then to charactefize the eftects‘of thes ~~
treatments on the molecular structure, microstructure,
thermal behavior, physicochemical properties, and functional
attributes of the nanocellulose fibers produced. overall, this
research introduces a simple method to create value-added
ingredients from soybean processing by-products, as well as
reducing waste and environmental pollution caused by
burning okara, which would promise for the potential health
benefits of producing and selling cellulose products in the
future.

abstract

nanocellulose was isolated from okara using either
ultrasound or high-pressure homogenization treatments.
dynamic light scattering, fourier transform infrared
spectroscopy, x-ray diffraction, x-ray photoelectron
spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, swelling
behavior, rheological properties, and thermal analysis were
used to characterize the physical-chemical and structural
properties of the cellulose obtained. sonication at 600 w for
15 min led to a cellulose material with a small mean particle
jiameter (d =0.22 ym), narrow polydispersity index (pdi =
0.21), strong negative charge (¢ = -36 mv), high swelling ratio
(sr = 7.6), high crystallinity index (ci = 72 %), and formed
viscous solutions. the initial pyrolysis temperature of the
cellulose increased from 212 to 225 °c, while the pyrolysis
residue decreased from 26 to 12 %, after the
sonication/homogenization treatment. the cellulose material
produced in this study may be applied in various food and
non-food applications as a texture modifier, stabilizer,
sonication/homogenization treatment. the cellulose material
produced in this study may be applied in various food and
non-food applications as a texture modifier, stabilizer,
structural component, or digestion modifier.
