4. conclusion

in this study, our findings suggested that different se species
and sphs-2 fraction significantly enhanced the cell viability
of (pb2*}-induced raw264.7 macrophages, and effectively
decrease no release via protecting cells against (pb?*)-
induced cytotoxicity and inflammation. moreover, sphs-2
dramatically decreased the secretion levels of pro-
inflammatory cytokines tnf-a, nf-«b, il-1f, myd88, il-6 and
il-8 when compared to the other se species groups. western
blot results revealed that sphs-2 effectively downregulated
the expressions of ixb, ikk, p38, and erk1/2, and the
phosphorylation of these protein kinases were successfully
blocked. the inhibitory effects of sphs-2 could be achieved
through regulating the nf-xb/mapk signaling pathway to
attenuate inflammatory response. the underlying
immunomodulatory mechanism of sphs-2 might be
attributed to the synergistic effects between se and the
attenuate inflammatory response. the underlying
immunomodulatory mechanism of sphs-2 might be
attributed to the synergistic effects between se and the
special peptides. these findings may indicate the potentials
of sphs-2 peptides as ingredients in functional food to
improve immune activity of macrophages.

3.7. sphs-2 and different se species inhibited
expression of related protein kinases in (pb?*)-
induced raw264.7 macrophages

in the present study, western blot analysis was conducted to
analyze translocation of nf-kb and mapk into the nucleus
and confirm the immunoregulatory mechanism of different
se species in (pb?*)-induced raw264.7 macrophages.
translocation of nf-«b and mapk are required to enable
phosphorylation of ikb, ikk, p38, and erk1/2, thus, p-ixb, p-
ikka/b, p-p38, and p-erk1/2 in the cytosol are also analyzed
by western blot. as illustrated in fig. 7, pb?*-only treatment
increased the expression levels of ikb, ikk, p38, erk1/2 and
corresponding phosphorylation about 2-4 folds compared to
by western blot. as illustrated in fig. 7, pb?*-only treatment
increased the expression levels of ikb, ikk, p38, erk1/2 and
corresponding phosphorylation about 2-4 folds compared to
control group in raw264.7cells (p<0.05). by contrast, sphs,
rphs, sel’ and semet decreased the expression of related
protein kinase. however, sphs-2 effectively downregulated
the expressions of ixb, ikk, p38, and erk1/2, and inhibited the
phosphorylations of ikb, ikk, p38, and erk1/2. these results
could reveal sphs-2 attenuates inflammatory response via
iting nf-xb/mapk signaling pathways. hence, a
schematic diagram may be proposed to depict the potential
immunomodulatory mechanism of sphs-2 peptides in fig. 8.
one of the speculations is that sphs-2 peptides regulate pro-
inflammatory mediator production and inhibit the
immunotoxicity of pb?* on raw264.7 macrophages via
regulating nf-xb/mapk signaling pathways. as a result,
associated consequences were inhibited, including
inflammatory response (tnf-a, il-18, nf-kb, myd88, il-8 and
il-6), the related protein kinases expression (ixb, ikk, p38,
and erk1/2) and corresponding phosphorylation (p-ikb, p-
ikka/b, p-p38, and p-erk1/2). it indicated that sphs-2 had the
il-6), the related protein kinases expression (ixb, ikk, p38,
and erk1/2) and corresponding phosphorylation (p-ikb, p-
ikka/b, p-p38, and p-erk1/2). it indicated that sphs-2 had the
immunoregulatory effects as well as protected cells against
(pb2*)-induced cytotoxicity. furthermore, many studies have
reported that met is supposed to be of great importance to
improve immune activity and met-enkephalin can modulate
stress-induced alterations of the immune response in mice
(zhao et al., 2016). se can regulate the inflammatory immune
changes and alleviate heavy metal-induced toxicity. based on
se species analysis results (fig. 3), the main form of se
species is semet in sphs-2. therefore, our study
demonstrated that combination of se and met were
synergistic for improving immune activity of macrophages.
this finding further substantiated that sphs-2 may provide
an additional benefit for improved efficacy against (pb2*)-
induced inflammation and toxicity. moreover, it is possible
that the immunoregulatory mechanism involves in the amino
acid sequence and structure characteristics of sphs-2
peptides, resulting in higher biological activity than other se
species. for the first time, we provide evidence that sphs-2
acid sequence and structure characteristics of sphs-2
peptides, resulting in higher biological activity than other se
species. for the first time, we provide evidence that sphs-2
peptides could inhibit the immunotoxicity of pb2* on
raw264.7 macrophages in the context of regulating nf-
xb/mapk signaling pathways. further investigations will
focus on immunomodulatory activity in animal trials.

the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines in macrophages
is an important factor in upregulating inflammatory
processes and immune response. it has been reported that
macrophages participate in immune response regulation,
inhibit the cytokines production, and attenuate inflammation
(he et al., 2019; varin and gordon, 2009). among them, nf-
xb and mapk could be activated by external factors, which
would interact with its receptors to trigger downstream
activation of inflammatory gene expression and cause
inflammatory disorder (simsek et al., 2010). kim et al. (2016)
has reported that the levels of tnf-a, il-1, and il-6 were
remarkably increased in lps-induced raw264.7
macrophages. meanwhile, il-6 was critically involved in
experimentally induced autoimmune diseases. therefore,
evaluating the effect of se-containing peptides on the
secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and their potential
mechanism is a good strategy to manipulate inflammatory
conditions and immunoregulation. the present study
demonstrates that the se-containing peptides sphs-2 fraction
mechanism is a good strategy to manipulate inflammatory
conditions and immunoregulation. the present study
demonstrates that the se-containing peptides sphs-2 fraction
are able to efficiently inhibit the secretion of pro-
inflammatory cytokines in (pb?*)-induced raw264.7
macrophages.

to further explore the immunoregulatory mechanism of
different se species, the change in the expression of pro-
inflammatory cytokines were investigated. we selected the
nf-b, and mapk pathways to assay se species how to exert
their immunoregulatory capacity. in this section, the effect of
ifferent se species on pro-inflammatory cytokines, including
tnf-a, il-1, nf-kb, myd88, il-8 and il-6, were investigated
in (pb?*)-induced raw264.7 macrophages. as shown in fig.
6, incubation of macrophages with (pb2*)-only significantly
(p<0.05) increased the secretion of pro-inflammatory
cytokines il-1, tnf-a, and nf-«b by 2.4, 2.2, and 3.9-fold
when compared to untreated control group. meanwhile,
myd88, il-8 and il-6 expression were also markedly
increased after pb?* treatment compared to control group.
however, the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines
myd88, il-8 and il-6 expression were also markedly
increased after pb?* treatment compared to control group.
however, the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines
exhibited different degree of decline in raw264.7cells
incubation with se-containing components (p<0.05)
compared to the (pb?*)-only treatment. similar inhibitory
activities were observed in the se-enriched phycocyanin that
inhibited the activation of macrophages by suppressing the
nuclear translocation of nf-b, which is involved in the pro-
inflammatory cytokines il-6, tnf-a production (zhu et al.,
2016). as expected, the greatest inhibitory activity was
recognized in sphs-2 among the samples, followed by semet,
se'v, sphs and rphs. these results suggested that the
activation of pro-inflammatory cytokines were inhibited in
the presence of se-containing components. however,
difference results might be attributed to the fact that the
composition of special amino acid, amino acid sequence,
molecular weight of se-containing peptides, in which the
carboxyl active hydrogen atoms and amino active hydrogen
atoms as active sites play the critical role in the anti-
inflammatory capacity.

3.5. inhibitory effect of different se species on
no production in inflammatory raw264.7 cells

no has been recognized as an important molecule involved
in the regulation of cell viability as well as the characteristic
of the inflammatory response. therefore, the level of no
indirectly reflects the course of the inflammatory reaction
and the immune response (nnafees et al., 2015). as illustrated
in fig. 5a, compared with control group, the levels of no

of pb2*-only group has been increased to 1.80-fold as.
compared with the control group (p<0.05), indicating that
pb?* treatment produced inflammatory response or the
immune damage. similar results could be observed in kim's
study, and they reported that no concentration significantly
increased in inflammatory model of lipopolysaccharide
induced raw264.7cells (kim et al., 2016). in contrast, the
levels of no significantly decreased after the addition of
three se-enriched components compared with pb?*-only
treatment group (p<0.05). in sphs-2 group, no content was
decreased by 150+0.23%, which was lower than other groups,
indicating that the se-containing peptides protected
raw264.7cells from (pb2*)-induced damage. this
concentration decrease would contribute to regulating
immune cell activity, which meant that the synergistic effects
between se and peptides might play an important role in the
inflammatory response and immune regulation. this result is

inflammatory response and immune regulation. this result is
consistent with the aforementioned. indeed, the elevated no
release is attributed to the up-regulation of pro-
inflammatory cytokines. these inflammatory factors activate
inos or further induce the overexpression of nos synthase,
which in turn promote no release (ding et al., 2018). garrido
et al. (2017) demonstrated that inos is a pro-inflammatory
enzyme which is associated with chronic inflammation and
synthesizes no. besides, park et al. (2013) revealed nf-xb
activation directly induced inos expression and led to no
generation. and this occurs through a mechanism that
involves the expression of related protein kinases in
inflammatory cells. therefore, it is reasonable to speculate
that se-enriched components could protect cells against
(pb2*)-induced inflammation and cytotoxicity. thus, the
mechanisms of macrophage activation and the possible
pathway of no release were proposed in fig. 5b. the
following sections would further explore this underlying
mechanism that causes the changes of related enzymes and
cytokines.

our previous studies have shown that the major se species in
sphs was semet and a small amount of se!” (fang et al.,
2017). therefore, semet and sel” were selected in this study.
to check the impact of different se species on the viability of
(pb?*)-induced cells, this section investigated rphs, sphs,
sphs-2, se'v and semet incubation with (pb?*)-induced cells.
as shown in fig. 4b, the viability of pb?*-only group
significantly decreased, while rphs and sphs were incubated
with raw264.7cells, and they did not obviously improve the
cell viability. however, when sphs-2, se” and semet were
added to (pb?*)-induced cells, they significantly enhanced the
cell viability, especially in sphs-2. the results demonstrated
that the components containing se were the major

added to (pb“*)-induced cells, they significantly enhaiiced the
cell viability, especially in sphs-2. the results demonstrated
that the components containing se were the major
contributors to both cytotoxicity and viability of (pb?*)-
induced cells. numerous studies have reported that se has an
antagonistic effect on this damage (jin et al., 2018). in
addition, sphs-2 increased the viability of cell. it may be due
to sphs-2 peptides possess the excellent biochemical
functions and specific antioxidant activity for short-chain
peptides.

moreover, in our previous study reported that sphs-2 showed
surprisingly effective inhibition of pb?* absorption and
reduced the (pb?*)-induced cytotoxicity (zhu et al., 2020). it
may possibly explain the reason for increased cell activity.

of sphs-2 peptides

the obtained sphs-2 peptides were further separated by rp-
hplc into four peaks (supplement fig. 1). according to the
peak time, it is named f1, f2, f3 and f4. the four fractions
were collected and analyzed, respectively. then, the amino
acid sequences and the molecular masses of four fractions
were identified by triple-tof ms/ms. in this study, we
tracked se and found that se is mainly exists in three
peptides. therefore, the secondary mass spectrum of se-
enriched peptides in sphs-2, molecular masses and the
amino acid sequence are shown in fig. 3a, b, 3c. the
secondary mass spectrum at the m/z of peptides were
determined to be 383.13da, 312.31 da, and 312.25da,
respectively. for the ion signals at m/z 383.13 and 203.03 in
fig. 3a, which can be explained that the absence of semet

fragment with m/z of 203.03 was -pro-ser-(y3). thus, the
amino acid sequence was identified to be semet-pro-ser.
imilarly, for the ion signals at m/z 443.11 and 312.31 in fig.
3b, which can be explained that the absence of met residues
(m/z 130.80) and the fragment ion form was [mesecys-
glujh*(y2). according to the database, the amino acid
sequence was identified to be met-mesecys-glu. finally, for
the ion signals at m/z 490.41 and 312.25 in fig. 3c, which also
can be explained that the absence of semet residues (m/z
196.00) and the fragment ion form was [mesecys-glu] h*.
the two fragments were dehydrated and form a tripeptide
fragment with the structure of [semet-mesecys-glu]h*.
thus, the amino acid sequence was identified to be semet-
mesecys-glu. accordingly, the amino acid sequence of
tripeptide was identified to be semet-pro-ser, met-mesecys-
glu, and semet-mesecys-glu. the detected molecular masses
of 383.13da, 312.31da, and 312.25da agreed well with the
theoretical mass calculated by the sequences.

the raw264.7cells were exposed to different concentrations

of the control group (with ommol/l pb2*) was expressed as

viability was gradually decreased (from 0.05mmol/l to
0.9mmoljl). the cell viability of (pb2*)-induced
raw264.7cells was reduced to 51.3% of the control group
values at 0.5mmol/l pb?* exposure (p<0.05). the results
indicated that higher concentration of pb?* treatment
resulted in excessive cell death, and similar phenomenon was
also observed in the work of husejnovic et al. (2018). mu et
al. (2019) found that (pb2*}-induced increased the levels of
reactive oxygen species (ros) in raw264.7cells led to
decreased activity of cells. our previous results proved that
the cell viability was dose-dependently decreased by pb2*
treatment, and it can cause the production of ros as well as
cells apoptosis (xu et al., 2016). therefore, we chose a
concentration of 0.5mmol/l pb?* treatment and the
constructed damage model was used to carry out the
subsequent experiments.

3.1. quantitative analysis of se and separation of
sphs-2 fractions

sphs fractions were initially isolated from se-enriched rice
hydrolysates. as shown in fig. 1, a clear separation into four
main fractions were obtained by sephadex g-15 column,
named sphs-1, sphs-2, sphs-3 and sphs-4, respectively.
then, four main fractions were collected and the content of
total se was analyzed. firstly, the total se content of se-
enriched rice and se-enriched rice hydrolysates are detected,
0.970mg/kg and 3.625mg/kg, respectively. as shown in fig. 1,
sphs-2 is the highest content of se (4.154+0.049mg/kg),
which decreased in the following trend: sphs-3>sphs-
1>sphs-4 (sphs-1, 1.45120.065mg/kg, sphs-3,
1.938+0.035mg/kg, sphs-4, 0.875 +0.044mg/kg). the content
which decfeased in the following trend: sphs-3>sphs- *
1>sphs-4 (sphs-1, 1.45120.065mg/kg, sphs-3,
1.938+0.035mg/kg, sphs-4, 0.875 +0.044mg/kg). the content
of se significantly decrease in sphs-4 compared with other
fractions. these differences in the content of se may be due
to the molecular structure and amino acid composition of
hydrolysate peptides, which influence its ability to bind to se.
in the present study, we mainly focused on sphs-2, since our
previous study has showed that sphs-2 showed the great
functional activity (xu et al., 2016). therefore, sphs-2 was
isolated from the sphs for the following investigation.

the regular rice protein hydrolysates (rphs) were obtained
by same method above mentioned. the freeze-dried sphs
were purified using a sephadex g-15 gel-filtration column
(1.5x45cm), and absorbance was measured at 280nm. the
production was further lyophilized for further analysis.

pb is better known as a toxic heavy metal, which is widely
dispersed in nature. it is mainly through consumption of
contaminated water and foods that pb accumulates in the
human body (kong et al., 2015; wu et al., 2019). pb exposure
not only lead to a broad range of physiological, biochemical
and behavioral dysfunctions, but also cause severe damages
to organs and tissues including livers, kidneys, lungs
(boskabady et al., 2018). moreover, excessive pb intake would
have adverse impacts on the immune system and nervous
system (paul et al., 2014), especially that it induced oxidative
damage to immune cells and dna damage of nerve cells. in
human body, the immune system plays a fundamental role to
the defiance against virus-infected diseases and regulates the
pathogenesis. therefore, the maintenance of homeostasis in
the immune system is critical for physical health.

several studies have reported sub-chronic pb intoxication
could reduce the functional activity of macrophage, diminish
neutrophil function and immune response (kosnett et al.,
2007; li et al., 2017; pan et al., 2018). in the work of dietert,
they found pb exposure could alter cell morphology, inhibit
cell adhesion, decrease the lysosomal enzyme release from
splenic macrophages, and that multimetal (arsenic+lead)
exposure cause a greater immunotoxic effect in mice (dietert
and piepenbrink, 2006). pb induced immunotoxicity was
associated with multiple negative feedback regulators of
immune response, which cause the changes of inflammatory
factors (pace et al., 2005). liu et al. (2012) reported that nf-
xb was actived in rats exposed to pb, resulting in release of
inflammatory cytokines. in addition, pb exposure will be a
promoter to cause failure of macrophages cell defense, and
then the expression of no, tumor necrosis factor-a (tnf-c)
and cytokines interleukin-18 (il-1) increase in cells, leading
promoter to cause failure of macrophages cell defense, and
then the expression of no, tumor necrosis factor-a (tnf-c)
and cytokines interleukin-18 (il-1) increase in cells, leading
to the development of inflammation and diseases (sansar et
al., 2011). hence, reducing pb toxicity and regulating the
mechanism of pb damage to cells is a promising
investigation.

 

selenium (se) is an essential micronutrient for human
metabolism, which has a large number of biological functions
and rewarding helps to maintain a healthy balance (li et al.,
2017). previous studies have revealed se constitute a dietary
factor that inhibits several degenerative diseases, and
regulate the impairment of the immune response,
inflammatory and toxic alteration of chemical agents (khoso
et al., 2015). smith and frances (1987) reported the

ioavailability of organic forms of se (se-methionine and
seyeast) was higher than that inorganic forms (selenite and
selenate). naziroglu et al. (2014) found that se and n-
acetylcysteine could regulate the oxidative stress, apoptosis,
and ca?* influx through trpv1-channel activation in a
seemné’s haindginer hinnerproumaredal je addition
acetylcysteine could regulate the oxidative stress, apoptosis,
and ca?* influx through trpv1-channel activation in a
traumatic brain injury hippocampus model. in addition,
present animal trials demonstrated se interact with the
heavy metals ion to alleviate its toxicity on livers. compared
with regular green tea polysaccharides, se-enriched green tea
polysaccharides could reduce the content of tnf-a and il-6 in
splenocytes, enhancing the antioxidant activity and immune
activity of mice splenocytes (yuan et al., 2015). therefore, se
can be used as a protective agent to provide alternative
potential opportunities in enhancing the immunity of body.
in previous studies, in previous studies, we have identified
that se species mainly are inorganic and organic form in se-
enriched rice and regular rice. for the se-enriched rice, the
content of organic se (semet) was approximately 86.9%, 6.8%
of inorganic se (se and se“), and minor selenocystine
(secys2) and trace selenomethionine selenoxide (seomet).
while nearly 60% of inorganic se (se) and 26.7% of organic
se (semet) were detected in the regular rice. we have found
that se-enriched rice protein was digested to low molecular
voiink earty- bu. wforgaminse (se ‘pant zo-) a urvigiinn
se (semet) were detected in the regular rice. we have found
that se-enriched rice protein was digested to low molecular
weight peptides, and se species were identified as mainly
semet, seomet, secys2 and inorganic se'y in vit
gastrointestinal digestion (fang et al., 2009, 2010).
afterwards, we isolated and identified the se-containing
peptides from sphs, and two novel se-containing peptide
sequences (semdpgqq and tsemmm) were verified with
immunomodulatory activity (fang et al., 2019). by
synthesizing semdpgqq and tsemmm peptides, it was
found that semet might have neuroprotective effects on pb?*-
induced oxidative stress in mouse hippocampal ht22cells
(wu et al., 2020). our latest study demonstrated that sphs
could retard the absorption of pb?* in caco-2cells via
chelating pb2* form complexes, and then reduce the
cytotoxicity of pb?* (zhu et al., 2020). to date, although above
researches revealed that se played an important role in
inflammation and immunity, and protected against the toxic
effects of heavy metal. however, the inhibitory mechanism of
different se species on (pb?*)-induced immunotoxicity is

different se species on (pb?*)-induced immunotoxicity is
unclear. hence, it is imperative to further understand the
relationship between different se species and inflammatory
immune changes, providing evidence to clarify the
immunoregulatory mechanism of se species.

thus, the purpose of this study was to (1) compare the effects
of different se species sphs, sphs-2, semet and se” on

relationship between different se species and regulatory
signaling pathways of immune system in (pb2*)-induced

previous studies have revealed that selenium-enriched rice
protein hydrolysates (sphs) could alleviate pb2*-induced
apoptosis in raw264.7 macrophages. the purpose of the
current study was to detect the effect of different selenium
(se) species on immunotoxicity of the pb2*-induced
raw264.7 macrophages and explore the potential
immunomodulatory mechanism. herein, sphs, an isolated
sphs fraction (sphs-2), selenomethionine (semet), selenite
(sel) were used to investigate their inhibitory effect and the
impacts on the expression of cytokines and related protein
kinases in immunomodulatory pathways. the results showed
that, compared with pb?*-only group, se-containing

impacts on tné exbression of cytoxiriés and ré1atédt provéin
kinases in immunomodulatory pathways. the results showed
that, compared with pb?*-only group, se-containing
components significantly enhanced the cell vial

raw264.7cells. furthermore, compared with other se
species, sphs-2 markedly decreased the secretion levels of
pro-inflammatory cytokines tnf-a, nf-xb, il-1, myd88, il-6
and il-8. western blot results demonstrated that sphs-2
effectively downregulated the expressions of ixb, ikka, p38,
and erk1/2, and also successfully blocked the
phosphorylation of these protein kinases. our findings
suggested that sphs-2 effectively attenuate inflammatory
response and inhibit the immunotoxicity of pb?* on
raw264.7 macrophages via regulating nf-xb/mapk signaling
pathways.
