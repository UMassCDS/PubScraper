 
3.4. size characterization based on raman
intensity

we also analyzed the raman intensities of the map collected
from all the particles. at 0.04gl"!, we established a positive
linear correlation between the raman intensity and the
reference particle size with the coefficient of regression
12=0.946 (fig. 5 (a)). however, for lower concentrations such
as 0.004 and 0.0004gl"", no linear correlation was observed.
here, we noticed that 173nm particles produced significantly
higher raman intensity than the nanosized particles but no
statistical difference was observed between the signal
intensities of 93,41 and 8nm particles. as the raman
intensity is dependent on the mass of the particles under the
focal area of the laser, at the concentration of 0.04gl"! where
s of 93,41 and 8nm particles. as the raman
intensity is dependent on the mass of the particles under the
focal area of the laser, at the concentration of 0.04gl"! where
the particles saturated and stacked on the membrane, the
larger sized particles resulted in a higher mass under the
focal area of the laser, resulting in statistically lower raman
intensity as the particle size decreased from 173 to 8nm. at
lower concentrations, the particles were well distributed
across the membrane however, as the particle size decreased,
the hydrodynamic diameter increased. this may have
resulted in similar mass under the focal area of the laser for
the particles between 93 and 8nm, resulting in statistically
indifferent results.

find any significant differences in the peak intensity of either
samples at a higher concentration (0.04gl~') when analyzed
at different magnifications (fig. 2 (c)). however, as seen in
fig. 2 (d), a significant increase in the peak intensity for both
particles was observed at 0.0004gl"! concentration with
100xmagnification. this could be again due to the different
illumination profiles of both objectives. these results
demonstrated that the 100xmagnification is more efficient in
analyzing lower sizes and concentrations of tio, particles,
which is valuable for the analysis of nps in food and
environment application. hence, the raman map was
collected using the 100xobjectives in the rest of the study.

 

3.3. size characterization based on the map area

the raman maps for the particle standards (8, 41, 93, 173nm)
were collected at three different concentrations using the 100
x objective, as shown in fig. 3. as the concentration
decreased from 0.04 to 0.004gl"', the map area occupied by
the red pixels was found to be decreased. we then looked at
x objective, as shown in fig. 3. as the concentration
decreased from 0.04 to 0.004gl"', the map area occupied by
the red pixels was found to be decreased. we then looked at
the correlations between the map area covered by the red
pixels presenting particles, the reference particle size
obtained from electron microscopy, and the hydrodynamic
diameter obtained from dls measurements. we noticed a
positive linear correlation (12=0.998) between the area
occupied by the particles (%) and the corresponding reference
particle size, and, a negative correlation (r2=0.994) between
the area occupied by the particles and the hydrodynamic
diameter for concentrations at 0.0004gl"! (fig. 4 (a)). similar
linear correlation between the map area and size (12=0.993)
was also found at 0.004gl" (fig. 4 (b). although no such
correlation was found at 0.04gl™! which could be because
the higher concentration may have saturated the particles on
the membrane resulting in particle stacking. at lower
concentrations, particles were well distributed throughout
the membrane.
3.2.2. compatibility of the objective lenses

for mapping under the raman imagining microscope, the
sample is required to be in focus to achieve optimum distance
for the laser to interact with the analyte. laser illumination
and light collection from the sample in raman spectrometer
involves components such as mirrors, fiber-optic probes,
detector, and microscopic objectives. in addition to the
acquisition time and laser power, the performance of raman
measurement depends on optical parameters such as the

um angle of collection and optical throughput [32]. the

   
 

measurement depends on optical parameters such as the
optimum angle of collection and optical throughput [32]. the
light collection efficiency of the microscope is directly related
to the numeric aperture (na) of the objective, which
determines the size of the conical beam of the light passing
through the lens [33]. hence, we firstly examined the two
objective lenses, 20x(na=0.40) and 100x(na=0.90), to
analyze 173nm and 8nm particles at three concentrations
(0.04, 0.004, and 0.0004gl"'). the raw images are shown in
fig. s2. the results demonstrated that 173nm particles
covered almost entire map area at 0.04 and 0.004gl'.
however, at 0.0004gl"! concentration, the map area with
particles obtained from the 100xobjective was significantly
higher than that from the 20x, suggesting the 100xobjective
was more efficient in detecting particles at lower
concentrations (fig. 2 (a)). similarly, for the 8nm particles, no
difference was observed between two different objectives at
the highest concentration examined (fig. 2 (b)). but at
0.004gl" concentration, the map area of particles detected
from the 100xobjective was significantly higher than that

 

e highest concentration exannned (rie
0.004gl" concentration, the map area of pa
from the 100xobjective was significantly higher than that
from the 20x. no particles were detected by the 20xobjective
at 0.0004gl"", while the 100xobjective was still able to
detect the particles. the reason that the 100 x objective
works better than the 20xfor the smaller particles and lower
concentrations (8nm and 0.0004gl”), is due to its higher na
as a result of better focus and illumination profile.

titanium dioxide suspensions, 0.4gl"", were prepared in
0.005m spp solution made in ultrapure water. the samples
were first sonicated in a bath sonicator [branson 2000,
branson ultrasonic, danbury, ct] for smin to initially

isperse the particles by breaking large agglomerates. to
obtain the uniform particle dispersion with the smallest
hydrodynamic diameter, the tio, suspension was then
sonicated using a probe sonicator (fisher scientific, waltham,
ma) for 10min at 75% amplitude. for raman measurements,
sample dilutions of desired concentrations (0.04, 0.004 and
0.0004gl"') were prepared with 0.005m spp solutions. one
milliliter of each sample was then filtered at negative 50kpa
pressure on 0.1m ptfe filter membrane using the filtration
system (millipore sigma, burlington, ma) equipped with a

2. materials and methods
1. introduction

titanium dioxide (tio) is a tasteless and odorless white
compound that occurs naturally. pure tio; is assembled in
three polymorphs i.e. rutile, anatase, and brookite from
which rutile and anatase are widely used in different
applications [1]. rutile is used as a white pigment in paints,
plastic, rubber, and paper, as a sun blocking agent, for air and
water purification, and in medical applications [2]. whereas
anatase is also used as a white pigment but in consumer
products such as pharmaceuticals, foods, and cosmetics.
anatase is considered generally recognized as safe (gras)
and used in foods under food additive category and
classification as e171. it is frequently used as a whitening
agent in toothpaste, non-dairy coffee creamers, chewing
gums, and candies. however, the particle size
characterization data of the food-grade tio, from numerous
studies have revealed that about 17-36% particles were
nanosized (smaller than 100nm) [[2}, [3], [4]. [5}. (6) [7] a
characterization data of the food-grade tio, from numerous
studies have revealed that about 17-36% particles were
nanosized (smaller than 100nm) [[2}. [3], [4]. [5} (6). [7] a
number of recent studies have investigated the toxicological
effects of titanium dioxide, especially pertaining to its
nanoparticles (ti0)-nps), and have demonstrated its
carcinogenic activity, cytotoxicity, and genotoxicity in animal
models [{8], [9], {10}, [11], [12], [13], [14]. however, these
effects were assessed in specific experimental conditions and
attributed to certain particle size and concentration.
therefore, the quantification and size characterization of the
tioy-nps is necessary to better assess its toxicological effects.

 

 

size characterization of inorganic nps such as ti02-nps poses
distinctive challenges due to its unique properties. many
studies have attempted characterizing the size of the ti0)-
nps from food and environment using different analytical
techniques [[ 15], [16], [17], [18], [19}, (20), [21]}. the current
technologies used for size characterization of ti02-nps
include microscopic, light scattering, flow fractionation, and
spectrometry-based methods [22]. dynamic light scattering
féclinologies used tor sizé characterization of tio7-nps
include microscopic, light scattering, flow fractionation, and
spectrometry-based methods [22]. dynamic light scattering
(dls) and flow-field fractionation (fff) are the commonly
used rapid measurement technique. whereas scanning
electron microscopy (sem) and transmission electron
microscopy (tem) are advanced technologies that provide
high-resolution images that can be utilized to determine the
particle shape and size. however, tio) is typically insoluble in
most solvents including water [23], and agglomeration in
aqueous solution is a characteristic of inorganic nps because
of its small size and strong particle-particle interactions.
additionally, size characterization using any of these
techniques requires uniform particle dispersion for accurate
measurement. currently used particle dispersion techniques
that modify the particle charge or provides the electrostatic
stabilization, may greatly improve the dispersion but not up
toa single particle level. larger agglomerates often cause an
error in dls measurement and sem images of agglomerated
particles are difficult to analyze [24].

 

dls measurement and sem images of agglomerate
particles are difficult to analyze [24].

error

the objective of this study is to develop and evaluate a
filtration-based raman mapping technique for the size
characterization of anatase tioz-nps. raman mapping is an
advanced che! aging technique where thousands of
spectra are collected for every pixel of a defined sample area
and integrated to generate the colorimetric image for a
designated peak of an analyte [25,26]. this approach provides
an advantage over point measurement technique, where the
spectra are collected at points scattered throughout the
sample which may result in larger variation in signal
intensities. raman mapping has been extensively applied in
cell imaging and chemical distribution [27,28]. combining
with membrane filtration, raman mapping has also been
used for the concentration and detection of chemicals,
nanoparticles, and microorganisms [28]. in this study, we
demonstrated two size characterization approaches using
this technique: based on the filter surface area covered by the
particles and raman intensity of the particles. before

were conducted to investigate the correlations with the map
surface area and raman intensity, respectively. to the best of
our knowledge, no similar study has reported a similar type
of work. the information obtained from this study will
greatly facilitate the application of this approach for further
applications in real-world samples.

abstract

characterization of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (tio2-nps)
is of significant importance in the production quality control,
applications and study of their toxicological effects. in this
study, we developed a filtration-based raman mapping
technique as a rapid approach for the analysis of different

izes and concentrations of anatase ti02-nps. four different
sizes of tio, standards: 173, 93, 41, and 8nm measured by
electron microscopy techniques were dispersed using a probe
sonicator with sodium pyrophosphate as a dispersing agent.
the resulting hydrodynamic diameter measured by dynamic
light scattering (dls) was stabilized at 192, 289, 325, and
360nm respectively as a negative correlation with the ones
by tem. these nps were then collected on a 0.1 ym (pore size)
filter membrane with a vacuum pump and scanned using a
raman imaging microscope. the result shows that the
100xobjective lens was more capable of detecting the

 

 

raman imaging microscope. the result shows that the
100xobjective lens was more capable of detecting the
smallest size particles (nm) and lowest concentration
(0.0004gl~) evaluated than the 20x objective lens. moreover,
at low concentrations (i.e. 0.0004 and 0.004gl~), we
established a linear correlation between the map area
covered by the particles and the particle size measured by
tem. while at higher concentration (i.e. 0.04gl™), a positive
correlation was established between the particle size and its
corresponding raman intensity. these results demonstrated a
successful application of raman mapping technique in rapid
characterization of the size of anatase ti0)-nps as small as
8nm, which will facilaite the ti0)-nps research, production,
and applications.
