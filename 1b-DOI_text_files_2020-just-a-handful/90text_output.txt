4. discussion

in drosophila, a high-sugar diet resulted in a number of
adverse symptoms including obesity, hyperglycemia,
triglyceride accumulation and insulin resistance (as
determined by small size and developmental delay in larvae
and reduced lifespan in adults; musselman et al., 2011). this
jet also caused up-regulation of genes for enzymes involved
in lipogenesis, gluconeogenesis, and b-oxidation (musselman
et al., 2011). these findings are consistent with those in
caenorhabditis elegans, mouse, and human and suggest a
common, evolutionarily conserved mechanism leading to
insulin resistance. further, it is well established that chronic

 

caenorhabditis elegans, mouse, and human and suggest a
common, evolutionarily conserved mechanism leading to
insulin resistance. further, it is well established that chronic
ddt exposure results in insulin resistance in vivo (lee et al.,
2011; kim et al., 2014) and in vitro (kim et al., 2017; xiao et
al., 2017). given these findings, it is plausible that, during the
long-term selection of the highly ddt-resistant 91-r strain
from the unselected 91-c strain, the selected 91-r flies may
have initially become insulin-resistant but then evolved
compensatory mechanisms allowing them to cope with
fitness disadvantages caused by maintaining energetically
demanding multiple resistance mechanisms resulting in thei
highly ddt-resistant phenotype. consistent with this
hypothesis, the pattern of differentially transcribed genes in
the iis pathway of 91-r flies (fig. 1) was for most part
opposite of that found in insulin-resistant mammalian
models or flies fed a high-sugar diet. in those studies,
hexokinase, ipin, and gly were significantly down-regulated
and pepck, gsk3b, and ccha2 were significantly up-
regulated (musselman et al., 2011; yao-borengasser et al.,
2006: lope and johnson, 2004: saltiel and kahn, 2001),______
and pepck, gsk3b, and ccha2 were significantly up-
regulated (musselman et al., 2011; yao-borengasser et al.,
2006; jope and johnson, 2004; saltiel and kahn, 2001).

 

 

the impact of the changes in the iis pathway gene expression
levels and nonsynonymous mutation patterns seen in 91-r is
most clearly evident in their response to nutritional status.
91-r flies only outlived 91-c flies under optimal feeding
conditions: their longevity was generally less than that of 91-
cflies under starvation, and excess sucrose conditions. it is
interesting that the lifespan of 91-r flies reared on excess
sucrose was reduced compared with that of similarly treated
91-c flies, a finding that mimics that found in insulin-
resistant drosophila fed a high-sugar diet (musselman et al.,
2011). it is also worth noting that in both high-sugar-fed and
ddt-treated drosophila, the genes for two key regulatory
enzymes in the pentose phosphate pathway, glucose-6-
phosphate-dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconate-
dehydrogenase, were significantly up-regulated (bijlsma and
kerver, 1983; musselman et al., 2011). because both
treatments resulted in insulin resistance, a role for the
dehydrogenase, were significantly up-regulated (bijlsma and
kerver, 1983; musselman et al., 2011). because both
treatments resulted in insulin resistance, a role for the
pentose phosphate pathway is implied, with increased
nadph levels driving increased fatty acid synthesis and
reduced glutathione (gsh) production as possible
compensatory mechanisms (bijlsma and kerver, 1983;
musselman et al., 2011).

consistent with the central roles of the iis pathway in
xenobiotic and stress responses, lifespan, and energy
metabolism (ikeya et al., 2002; tatar et al., 2003; kenyon,
2005; giannakou and partridge, 2007), our study
demonstrates a role of this pathway in the maintenance of
the ddt resistance phenotype in 91-r flies. inhibitors for the
two most differentially expressed genes, pepck and gsk3b
(fig. 1), reduced the levels of ddt resistance in both 91-r and
91-c. however, the level of impact of the inhibitors was
dependent on the nutritional status of the flies, with the
greatest reductions occurring in optimally fed (heavier) flies
of the 91-r strain (table 2, table 3; si appendix, table $4).
gependent on tie nutnitionar status of the nies; withthe

of the 91-r strain (table 2, table 3; si appendix, table $4).
thus, the iis pathway appears to be both an important
component associated with the maintenance of ddt
resistance in 91-r and an exploitable vulnerability (i.
achilles’ heel) in the phenotype.

an

 

both expression differences and nonsynonymous mutational
ifferences were found in genes associated with longevity
and energy metabolism. a number of genes in the iis
pathway with observed expression level differences between
91-r and 91-c, such as those encoding drosophila insulin-like
peptides (dilps), and glycogen phosphorylase (glyp), are
known to be associated with lifespan (suh et al., 2008; bai et
al., 2012). of the two genes that were most highly down-
regulated in 91-r, namely those encoding gsk3f and pepck,
both are associated with energy metabolism. gsk3b, an
isoform of gsk3, regulates glycogen synthesis and multiple
cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation,
motility, and survival (luo, 2009). pepck catalyzes the first
committed and rate-limiting step in gluconeogenesis and

 

cellular processes including proliferation, differentiation,
motility, and survival (luo, 2009). pepck catalyzes the first
committed and rate-limiting step in gluconeogenesis and
plays an essential role in glucose metabolism, converting
proteins and fat to glucose (burgess et al., 2007). additionally,
pepck had the greatest number of amino acid differences
identified between 91-r and 91-c, both fixed and unfixed,
among the screened proteins within the iis pathway.

there has been no prior report indicating a direct
relationship between ddt resistance and gsk38, although
this multifunctional serine/threonine kinase has been shown
to be affected by pesticides, causing pathogenesis and
neurodegeneration (songin et al., 2011; kaytor and orr, 2002;
martinez et al., 2002). it is well established in diabetic
mammals and humans with type 2 diabetes that gsk3
activity is increased, which inhibits glycogen synthesis by
phosphorylating glycogen synthase and glucose uptake by
phosphorylating insulin-receptor-coupled protein irs-1,
resulting in hyperglycemia (jope and johnson, 2004; saltiel
and kahn, 2001). in addition, inhibitors of gsk3 have been
phosphorylating insulin-receptor-coupled protein irs-1,
resulting in hyperglycemia (jope and johnson, 2004; saltiel
and kahn, 2001). in addition, inhibitors of gsk3 have been
used to treat insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes by
reversing its effect on glycogen synthesis and glucose uptake
(dokken and henriksen, 2006). thus, the down-regulation of
gsk38 in 91-r may attenuate the insulin resistance caused by
ddt, accelerating glycogen synthesis by up-regulating glys
and increasing glucose uptake by allowing irs-1 to be
unphosphorylated. it should be noted that genes for both
glycogen synthase and glyp (which releases glucose-1-
phosphate from glycogen) were significantly up-regulated in
91-r. consistent with previous reports (lee et al., 2017;
dokken and henriksen, 2006) and our observations of
relevant expression, our glycogen assay indicated that 91-r
females stored less energy in the form of glycogen than did
91-c females and consumed a larger percent of their stored
glycogen during the early stages of starvation (fig. 4),
indicating the importance of this process in the survival of
91-r females.

indicating the importance of this process in the survival of

given the above, the use of licl to inhibit gsk3f should have
made the 91-r flies more resistant to ddt, not less as seen in
our current study. however, since the transcription of gsk3-
po is already significantly down-regulated in 91-r, its,
additional inhibition by licl likely has reduced the functions
of this enzyme to levels where it is no longer capable of
carrying out it vital physiological roles. additionally, other
cellular pathways besides glucose and glycogen transport
under the regulation of gsk38, such as protein synthesis,
gene transcription, and cell differentiation, were affected and
caused the increased susceptibility of the 91-r flies to ddt in
the presence of licl (dokken and henriksen, 2006; jope and
johnson, 2004), it has been shown also that inhibition of
gsk3 increases tnfa-induced cytotoxicity (jope and johnson,
2004), an effect that is consistent with the increased ddt
seen in licl-treated 91-r flies. taken together,
these findings demonstrate that either too little or too much
gsk3 activity can result in increased cell death and mortality.

oxidative stress is also known to impact the iis pathway,
including altering energy utilization, inducing insulin
resistance/diabetes, and increasing pepck gene expression
({to et al., 2006; evans et al., 2005; valenti et al., 2008). ddt
is also a known oxidative stressor (hassoun et al., 1993;
barros et al., 1994) and inducer of insulin resistance (arroyo
salgado et al., 2017), and it has been shown to increase pepck
activity, augmenting the production of hyperglycemia (kacew
et al., 1972). the reduced expression of pepck seen in our
study suggests that gluconeogenesis in 91-r is lower than in
91-c. pepck is, however, overexpressed in all models of
diabetes and is usually used as an indicator of gluconeogenic
flux changes (veneziale et al., 1983; chakravarty et al., 2005)
and hyperglycemia. the down-regulation, which reduces the
production of glucose and hyperglycemia, and amino acid
changes in pepck seen in 91-r may be associated wi
selection for mechanisms that alleviate oxidative stress

changes in pepck seen in 91-r may be associated with
selection for mechanisms that alleviate oxidative stress
caused by prolonged ddt exposure and the stress of insulin
resistance (such as the activation of key regulatory enzymes
in the pentose phosphate pathway resulting in increased
levels of nadph, leading to increased levels of reduced
glutathione) or possibly as a compensatory response to the
hyperglycemic state associated with an insulin-resistance-
like state) or both. these previous studies, coupled with our
inhibitor experiments, suggest a role of pepck in the
maintenance of the ddt resistance phenotype in 91-r.
nonetheless, as with gsk3-po, the transcription of pepck-pa
is significantly reduced in 91-r and its further inhibition by
hydrazine sulfate likely reduced the function of this enzyme
to levels where it is no longer capable of carrying out it vital
physiological role.

although the down-regulation of both gsk3b-po and pepck-
pais consistent with a possible compensatory mechanism
against hyperglycemia resulting from insulin resistance
caused by long-term ddt exposure in 91-r flies, it may also
pais consistent with a possible compensatory mechanism
against hyperglycemia resulting from insulin resistance
caused by long-term ddt exposure in 91-r flies, it may also
present a problem of glucose availability for glycolysis and for
providing krebs cycle substrates used in energy production.
ddt treatment of drosophila has also been shown to increase
enzymes involved in the pentose phosphate pathway,
resulting in fatty acid synthesis, and in b-oxidation of fatty
acids (an energy-producing process). the coordinated up
regulation of hex-c-pa, ipin-pl, and acc-pa in the 91-r strain
is consistent with the possibility that fatty acid oxidation is
an alternative energy-providing mechanism in this ddt-
resistant strain.

 

 

the nutritional status of the flies also influenced the t¢ ity
of ddt and impacted the effectiveness of hydrazine sulfate
and licl on reducing resistance levels in the tested fly strains.
flies under suboptimal rearing conditions were lighter, more
sensitive to ddt, and often less sensitive to the pepck and
gsk38 inhibitors than were flies under more optimized
rearing conditions. our results are consistent with those of
seasitive di taikl vidar ess seale vo che reek ah
gsk38 inhibitors than were flies under more optimized
rearing conditions. our results are consistent with those of
way (1954) and buhler and shanks (1970), who showed that
ddt in insects and vertebrates, respectively, is more toxic to
lighter/smaller individuals; thus, ddt toxicity and the impact
of the pepck and gsk38 inhibitors on such
resistance/tolerance appears to be directly linked to energy
metabolism and fly weight.

in the present study, we have (i) provided evidence for a role
of the iis pathway in maintaining a highly resistant
phenotype against ddt and (ii) identified an achilles’ heel
resistance trait in a ddt-resistant drosophila population. this
work, however, represents only a prove of concept of the
achilles’ heel resistance trait, as ddt is not broadly in use, the
iis pathway is evolutionarily conserved across insects and
mammals and may not provide the selectivity needed for safe
implementation, and drosophila is a model system that likely
does not mimic many other insects. a considerable amount of

work remains to be done to determine whether practical
compounds for inhibiting resistance can be identified and
how broadly applicable such an approach may be across
insecticide classes, insect species, and resistant strains.
regardless of such potential applications, the 91-r strain
represents a unique model (due to its high resistance to ddt,
well established resistance mechanisms, and many “omics”
tools) for understanding the interplay between xenobiotic
stress, energy metabolism, and longevity within the context
of the insulin signaling pathway.

3.5. impact of rearing conditions on adult
weights and lcso values

flies under two different rearing conditions showed
significantly different body weights for both genotypes and
sexes (p<0.0001 for all groups) (si appendix, table $4).
compared with flies under optimal rearing conditions, flies
significantly different body weights for both genotypes and
sexes (p<0.0001 for all groups) (si appendix, table $4).
compared with flies under optimal rearing conditions, flies
under suboptimal rearing conditions showed weight
decreases. rearing conditions also impacted the lcso of each
strain-by-sex combination, both in the presence and in the
absence of dietary inhibitors (table 2, table 3; si appendix,
fig. s4, fig. $5), flies under optimal rearing conditions were
consistently more resistant to ddt than those under
suboptimal rearing conditions, and in some cases these
ifferences were dramatic. for example, the lcso of 91-c
females under optimal rearing conditions was 51.6yg
ddt/vial and decreased to 6.8yg ddt/vial under suboptimal
rearing conditions (a reduction of 7.6-fold). these differences
were even more dramatic for the 91-r strain. for females, an
lcso of 136,883 1g ddt/vial was observed under optimal
rearing conditions and 523.3y.g ddt/vial under suboptimal
rearing conditions (a reduction of 262-fold). for males, an
lcso of 66,073 pg ddt/vial was observed under optimal
rearing conditions and 143.7 yg ddt]vial under suboptimal
rearing conditions (a reduction of 460-fold).

lcso of 66,073 pg ddt/vial was observed under optimal
rearing conditions and 143.7 yg ddt]vial under suboptimal

3.6. effect of excess sucrose in diet on longevity

the 91-c strain responded differently from the 91-r strain
when reared on commercial diet prepared with excess
sucrose (si appendix, fig. s6, table $5). the median lifespan
(lt50) for 91-c females was 49, 34, and 28 d when reared on
commercial diet supplemented with low, medium, and high
excess sucrose, respectively, while 91-c males had a lts9 of
26, 32, and 23 d, respectively. female 91-r flies fed with
supplementary low, medium, and high excess sucrose had a
median lifespan of 14, 19, and 16 d, respectively, indicating
that 91-r females have a shorter lifespan than 91-c flies of
either gender at comparable sucrose levels (p<0.05). 91-r
females also had shorter lifespans than 91-r males, which
had an ltso of 20, 24, and 24 d when reared on diet
supplemented with low, medium, and high excess sucrose,
respectively. on diet supplemented with low and medium
excess sucrose, 91-r males had tly shorter lifespan

 

 

 
 

 

supplemented with low, medium, and high excess sucrose,
respectively. on diet supplemented with low and medium
excess sucrose, 91-r males had a significantly shorter lifespan
than 91-c males (p<0.05).

3.7. test for achilles’ heel resistance traits

the aim of this study was to alter the level of resistance to
ddtiin flies fed inhibitors of selected proteins/enzymes in
biochemical pathways involved in energy metabolism. oral
ingestion of either a pepck or gsk38 inhibitor (hydrazine
sulfate [hys] or lithium chloride [licl], respectively)
decreased the lcso values of females and males for both the
91-c and 91-r strains when exposed to a range of ddt
concentrations. under optimal rearing conditions (table 2),
oral exposure to hys reduced the level of ddt resistance in
91-r females by 161.2-fold and in 91-r males by 218.1-fold.
oral exposure to licl reduced the level of ddt resistance in
91-r females and males by 1.6- and 20.5-fold, respectively.
for the susceptible 91-c strain, feeding with hys reduced dd1
resistance by 5.3- and 4.0-fold for females and males,

91-r females and males by 1.6: aiid 20.5-fold, fespectively.”
for the susceptible 91-c strain, feeding with hys reduced dd1
resistance by 5.3- and 4.0-fold for females and males,
respectively. oral exposure to licl reduced ddt resistance by
4.2- and 2.8-fold for 91-c females and males, respectively.
hys+licl feeding reduced ddt resistance levels by 253.9- an¢
186.0-fold for 91-r females and males, respectively. the
combined treatment decreased the level of ddt resistance of
91-c females and males by 9.7- and 4.7-fold, respectively.
combined exposure to hys and licl significantly increased
sensitivity to ddt in 91-c females compared with hys alone.
significant combinatory effects over hys alone were not
observed in 91-c males and in 91-r females or males,
although the combination substantially reduced the level of
ddt resistance in 91-r females.

the glycogen contents before starvation (0h) of 91-c and 91-r
females were 17.41+1.03 and 14.33+4.0ug glycogen/mg fresh
weight, respectively (fig. 4). nonstarved 91-r females showed
a 17.7% reduction in glycogen content compared to
nonstarved 91-c females. after starvation for 24h, the average
glycogen content for 91-c females decreased to

a 17.7% reduction in glycogen content compared to
nonstarved 91-c females. after starvation for 24h, the average
glycogen content for 91-c females decreased to
12.99£0.92yg/mg fresh weight (a 25.4% reduction compared
to nonstarved), which was significantly higher than that of
91-r females (9.60.25 yg/mg fresh weight, a 32.6%
reduction compared to nonstarved). however, no difference
in glycogen content between females of 91-c and 91-r was
observed after 48h of starvation. for males, there was no
significant difference in glycogen content between 91-c and
91-r at any of the three time points tested.
three different adult age groups (3-4, 5-6, and 9-10 d old)
were examined to investigate survival rates of 91-c and 91-r
flies after starvation (fig. 3). under starvation conditions, 91-
c females survived longer than 91-r females (p<0.05), 91-c
males survived longer than 91-r males (p<0.05), and female
flies survived longer than male flies (p<0.05; fig. 3).

among the 15 differentially expressed transcripts identified
by rna-seq in 91-r vs 91-c, three up-regulated transcripts
(lpin-pl, hex-c-pa, and erk (rl)-ph) and three down-
regulated transcripts (pepck-pa, gsk3-po, and lpin-pe)
together showed a total of 12 nonsynonymous mutations in
91-r (table 1). among the down-regulated transcripts in 91-
r, six nonsynonymous mutations were found in pepck-pa at
bp 200, 415, 1009, 1010, 1612, and 1870, which respectively
led to amino acid changes v67g, m139l, r337k (resulting
from the mutations at both 1009 and 1010bp), e538k, and
a624p (table 1; si appendix, fig. s2). additionally, one fixed
insertion starting at bp 1755 led to a single amino acid
insertion at position 586 in pepck-pa in 91-r (si appendix,
table s3, fig. s2). only one mutation in the transcript for
gsk3b-po (bp 922, which led to amino acid change t308a)
and two in the transcript for lpin-pe (bp 788 and 3134, which
table s3, fig. s2). only one mutation in the transcript for
gsk3b-po (bp 922, which led to amino acid change t308a)
and two in the transcript for lpin-pe (bp 788 and 3134, which
respectively led to amino acid changes t260p and s1045f)
were predicted, and all three were classified as fixed (table
1). for the three up regulated transcripts (lpin-pl, hex-c-pa,
and erk (rl)-ph), each was predicted to have one mutation
differing between the two strains. the mutations were
predicted at bp 778 for lpin-pl (t260p; fixed), bp 1049 for
hex-c-pa (k35or; fixed), and bp 443 for erk (rl)-ph (which
introduced a premature stop codon; unfixed) (table 1).
moreover, six putative insertion/deletion polymorphisms
between 91-r and 91-c were detected in four transcripts and
validated by sanger sequencing of the ddt-resistant 91-r
strain; among the four, only pepck-pa was differentially
expressed. among the six polymorphisms, five (including the
one in pepck-pa) were fixed and only one was unfixed (si

among the 39 transcripts (encoded by 31 iis pathway genes)
that were not differentially expressed, 102 nonsynonymous
nucleotide changes were found (si appendix, table $2). out of
these nonsynonymous changes, 50% were fixed for different
alleles in 91-c and 91-r, whereas 50% were unfixed within
one of the two strains. five fixed single-nucleotide
polymorphism (snp) mutations were found at bp locations
320, 423, 430, 532, and 1810 in gsk38-pm, which respectively
led to amino acid changes p107r, d141e, $144t, ti78a, and
t603a (si appendix, fig. s3, table $2).

3.3. fitness cost: lifespan of 91-c and 91-r under
normal and starvation conditions

to determine the fitness costs resulting from resistance to
ddt, the lifespan and effect of starvation of females and
males of 91-c and 91-r were investigated. under optimal
rearing conditions, the ddt-resistant 91-r strain showed a
significantly longer lifespan than 91-c for both females and

of 114 nonsynonymous nucleotide changes (i., predicted to

reading frames (orfs) of transcripts from 34 of the 80 iis
pathway genes examined, and no amino acid sequence
ifferences were found in the predicted products of the
remaining 46 genes. out of the 114 nonsynonymous changes,
51.8% were fixed for different alleles in 91-c and 91-r,
whereas the remaining 48.2% were segregating (unfixed)
within one of the two strains.

 
3.1. differential gene expression between 91-c
and 91-r

fifteen transcripts from the iis pathway were predicted via
rna-seq to be differentially regulated: eight and seven
transcripts were respectively up- and down-regulated in 91-r
compared to 91-c (false discovery rate (fdr)<0.05 and logy
fold change [1.0]; si appendix, table s1, fig. s1). the rt-qpcr
validation of the predicted significant quantitative
differences in expression levels among seven of the eight up-
regulated transcripts and four of the seven down-regulated
transcripts showed a similar trend between the results of
bnitreaneviieapnsshareobisinndily rvapcp ur ere ap-
regulated transcripts and four of the seven down-regulated
transcripts showed a similar trend between the results of
rna sequencing and those obtained by rt-qpcr (r2=0.6793,
p<0.01), confirming the predicted differential expression
between strains based on pearson's correlation coefficient
test (fig. 1). the largest up-regulations in 91-r relative to 91-c
were seen for lipin-pl, acc-pa, and glys-pa, and the largest
down-regulations were observed for pepck-pa, gsk3b-po,
and ccha2-pa (fig. 1).

for rt-qpcr, statistical analysis was performed using
student's t-test to compare the results between 91-c and 91-
r. for glycogen assays and body weight, one-way anova was
used, and means comparisons were made by using student's
t test (p<0.05) calculated using spss software (version 19.0;
spss inc., usa). the median lifespans under fed, starvation, or
excess sucrose conditions were all calculated using the probit

function in spss (version 19.0). for mortality bioassays,
probit analysis was conducted by using spss software
(version 19.0).

female or male flies 1 to 2 d old from each strain were placed
into a plastic vial (28mmx95mm height) and fed with
inhibitors mixed in 5% sucrose solution. the inhibitors used
were hydrazine sulfate (hys; pepck inhibitor, sigma-aldrich,
10mm) and lithium chloride (licl; gsk38 inhibitor, sigma-
aldrich, 20mm) (hussain et al., 2017; mudher et al., 2004). a
cotton ball (fishersci.com », cat no. 22-456-883, usa) was
soaked in an inhibitor solution in a 1.5-ml centrifuge tube
and subsequently placed into a 100-ml plastic vial (choi et al.
2017), after feeding on inhibitor solution for 2 d, 20 females
or males from either the 91-c or 91-r strain were used in ddt

 

ioassays.

 

to examine the effect of inhibitors under different rearing
regimes, flies were reared either under optimal or suboptimal
rearing conditions. under optimal rearing conditions, 100
mating pairs of flies were maintained in bottles containing
50ml of standard medium and allowed to lay eggs for 4 d. all
adults were then removed to ensure the optimal density of
larva. for suboptimal rearing conditions, adults were not

adults were then removed to ensure the optimal density of
larva. for suboptimal rearing conditions, adults were not
removed until the adult emergence of the next generation.
under suboptimal conditions, flies were maintained in the
same bottle on the same medium (diet) for at least three
generations, so the 2nd-, 3rd-, and 4th-generation flies were
fed on left-over diet as well as on excretions from previous
generations. thus, optimal rearing conditions provided
sufficient food for flies, whereas under suboptimal rearing
conditions, flies faced diminishing food quantity and quality.

 

mortality bioassays using ddt were conducted following the
method of strycharz et al. (2013). briefly, various
concentrations of ddt dissolved in acetone were transferred
into 20-ml transparent glass vials. each vial was then rolled
on its side in a fume hood till the acetone evaporated. to test
flies raised under optimal dietary rearing conditions, the ddt
working concentration was serially diluted by up to 256-fold
from the stock concentration (64mg/ml) for 91-r, and diluted
by 40-400 fold from the stock concentration (800 pg/ml) for
91-c. to test flies raised under suboptimal dietary rearing
from the stock concentration (64mg/ml) for 91-r, and diluted
by 40-400 fold from the stock concentration (800 pg/ml) for

conditions, the ddt working concentration was serially
iluted by 2-1600 fold from the stock concentration,
(8mg]ml) for 91-r and by 20-8000 fold from the stock
concentration (400yg/ml) for 91-c. after all the acetone
evaporated, 20 flies of different strain/sex combinations were
placed into the vials. vials were capped with cotton plugs
moistened with a 5% sucrose solution in distilled water. the

 

number of dead flies in each vial was recorded after 24h.
2.7. glycogen assay

the glycogen contents of 91-c and 91-r female and male flies
were measured at 0, 24, and 48h after starvation according to
the method described in tennessen et al. (2014), data (ug
glycogen/mg fresh weight) were expressed relative to the
fresh body weight of each fly. three replicates were
performed for each treatment.
2.6. longevity assay at different levels of excess
sucrose in the diet

twenty virgin female and male flies from the 91-c and 91-r
strains were collected and reared separately on blue diet
(formula 4-249; carolina.coma) made with three different
sucrose solutions in water: 5.13% sucrose for low sucrose (ls),
17.1% for medium sucrose (ms), and 34.2% for high sucrose
(hs). assuming no sucrose already present in the blue diet
mix, which has a proprietary formula, these percentages
represent the final sucrose percentage in the diet. to prevent
bacterial and mold growth, propionic acid (0.5%) and nipagin
solution (1% nipagin m [tegosept m], p-hydroxybenzoic acid)
were added to all sucrose solutions used for making blue
bacterial and mold growth, propionic acid (0.5%) and nipagin
solution (1% nipagin m [tegosept m], p-hydroxybenzoic acid)
were added to all sucrose solutions used for making blue

iets. there were four biological replicates for each
treatment, starting on different dates. flies were provided
with fresh diet every 2weeks to prevent bacterial and mold
growth and desiccation of diet. mortality was recorded every
2d.

rt-qpcr validation was carried out on iis pathway genes for
validation of rna-seq estimated differences between the 91-

synthesis methods were similar to those previously described
by seong et al. (2017). the rt-qpcr primers are shown in si
appendix, table s6, and ribosomal protein 49 (rp49) was used
as the reference gene. the reaction for rt-qpcr included 104
of sybr select master mix (applied biosystems inc., usa),
0.3um of each primer, approximately 100ng of cdna, and
sterilized water to a total volume of 20pl. the thermocycler
program was as follows: 95°c for 3min, followed by 40cycles
of 95°c for 10s, 60°c for 10s, and 72°c for 20s. all
amplification reactions were performed with the
steponeplus real-time pcr system (applied biosystems inc.)
with three biological replicates. the mean of the threshold
cycle (ct) values from the three replicates of each strain were
determined and the relative expression levels calculated
using the formula (244) (livak and schmittgen, 2001).

after separately mapping rna-seq reads from 91-c and 91-r
flies to the drosophila iis pathway reference genes, consensus
sequences were obtained by using the “map reads to
reference” tool of the clc genomic workbench 9.5 (qiagen)
software package. related mapping parameters were set as
follows: minimum length fraction=0.9, minimum similarity
fraction=0.8, insertion/deletion cost=3, and mismatch
cost=3. the consensus sequences of all iis pathway genes
were translated by using clc genomics workbench.
alignments of the putative amino acid sequences were
performed with geneious 11.0.2 software

(http: //www-geneious.coma) (kearse et al., 2012). the
consensus base frequency of mapped reads compared to the
reference sequence was generated as previously described by
seong et al. (2018). all mutations found from rna-seq data
were verified by pcr amplification.

for the lifespan assay under fed conditions, virgin females
and males from the 91-c and 91-r strains were collected and
reared separately on a commercially available diet (jazz-mix
drosophila food, fishersci.com, cat. no. as153). to make
sure the adults were of similar age, the newly emerged flies
were collected from rearing bottles that had been emptied 5h
previously. adults of the same sex were kept at a density of
30 per vial. flies were transferred to fresh diet every 4 d.
mortality was monitored every 2 d. six replicates were
performed for each treatment.

survival of 91-c and 91-r flies was measured in vials with
8ml of 1% agar (starvation conditions), which allowed flies
access to water but not nutrient as previously described by

2.1. drosophila melanogaster strains

in this study, we used the highly ddt-resistant drosophila
strain 91-r and its corresponding non-ddt-selected control
strain, 91-c, which were established previously (merrell,
1960, merrell, 1965; merrell and underhill, 1956; seong et al.
2017, seong et al., 2018). these two fly strains were reared in
separate colonies on a commercially available medium (jazz-
mix drosophila food; fisher scientific, cat. no. as153) under
conditions of 26+1°c, 50% relative humidity, and a 14-h light
/10-h dark cycle. the 91-r strain has been continually
exposed to ddt (98%; sigma-aldrich) by maintaining the flies
in a colony bottle in the presence of a filter paper disk with
150mg ddt {seong et al., 2018), whereas 91-c has been
exposed to ddt (98%; sigma-aldrich) by maintaining the flies
in a colony bottle in the presence of a filter paper disk with
150mg ddt (seong et al., 2018), whereas 91-c has been
maintained without any exposure to ddt. flies were
transferred to a bottle with fresh diet every 3weeks.

2.2. differential expression of iis pathway genes

all rna-seq read data sets were previously generated from
91-c and 91-r in triplicate (seong et al., 2017) and, for this
study, were retrieved from the national center for
biotechnology information (ncbi) short read archive (sra)
database (accession numbers: srx2611754, srx2611759).

clc genomics workbench version 9.5 (qiagen) was used to
analyze the transcriptomic data. after removing illumina
adapters and filtering out low-quality reads, the trimmed
data were obtained from the raw reads. gene sequences of
the iis pathway were downloaded from the flybase database

expression levels of the iis pathway genes were compared
between 91-c and 91-r using the number of reads per
kilobase per million (rpkm) of mapped rna-seq reads. the
fdr method was used to determine the threshold p-values in
order to establish the differential expression of genes in the
iis pathway. an fdr of <0.05 and a log; fold change of 2|1|
were used as thresholds to determine significant differences
in gene expression.
2. materials and methods
1. introduction

piperonyl butoxide may represent the only commercial
compound available to suppress metabolic insecticide
resistance in insects, primarily through the inhibition of
cytochrome p450 monooxygenases (p450s) (cross et al.,
2017). to our knowledge, very few reports have described
approaches for identifying other resistance-inhibiting
compounds (hardstone et al., 2015). pittendrigh et al., 2008,
pittendrigh et al., 2014 have proposed that “
could be used to identify potential “achilles' heel” resistance
traits (ie., resistance-related proteins that, when inhibited,
would result in the reduction or loss of the pesticide
cetintance renton g peni mal rir cittemsiaha
traits (ie., resistance-related proteins that, when inhibited,
would result in the reduction or loss of the pesticide
resistance phenotype). pittendrigh et al., 2008, pittendrigh et
al, 2014 predicted that such an approach would involve
determining pathways that both contribute to resistance and,
if inhibited, may render the insect incapable of maintaining
the resistance phenotype (or, as a corollary, may make
susceptible insects hypersusceptible to pesticides).

 

mics” tools

drosophila melanogaster (hereafter referred to as drosophila)
has been used over the last half-century as a tool to explore
the mechanisms leading to insecticide resistance and the
consequences of pesticide exposure. the laboratory-selected
ddt-resistant drosophila strain 91-r was established over
goyears ago and has received intermittent but intense ddt
selective pressure since then (merrell and underhill, 1956;
merrell, 1960, merrell, 1965). its counterpart strain, 91-c, was
derived from the same progenitor population as 91-r, but has
not been selected with ddt in the laboratory. using these
drosphila strains, pedra et al., 2004, pedra et al., 2005 had

not been selected with ddt in the laboratory. using these
drosphila strains, pedra et al., 2004, pedra et al., 2005 had
shown genomic differences between ddt-resistant and -
susceptible strains in energy-related pathways. for example,
both the down-regulation of glycolytic enzyme transcripts
and the up-regulation of acyl-coa dehydrogenase and
isocitrate dehydrogenase transcripts in a ddt-resistant strain
suggest that lipid metabolism and the krebs cycle may
increase ddt detoxification (pedra et al., 2004).
subsequently, a proteomics approach validated that ddt
resistance involved a number of energy-related pathways
including glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, the pentose phosphate
shunt, the krebs cycle, and fatty acid oxidation (pedra et al.,
2005). thus, this pair of fly strains represents a logical system
for testing the achilles’ heel resistance trait concept.

as one of the key regulatory pathways in energy metabolism,
the insulin/ insulin-like growth factor (igf)-like signaling
(iis) pathway, associated with insulin resistance, is

evolutionarily conserved across invertebrates and

pathway plays important roles in growth and development
(underwood et al., 1994; edgar, 2006; engelman et al., 2006)
and is also related to lifespan regulation, metabolism of
xenobiotics, and stress resistance (hwangbo et al., 2004;
saltiel and kahn, 2001; slack et al., 2011; tatar et al., 2003).
to date, the energy-related adverse effects of ddt have been
extensively studied in higher animals such as rodents (kacew
and singhal, 1974; yau and mennear, 1977) and humans
(everett et al., 2007; cox et al., 2007; lee et al., 2017), but, to.
the authors’ knowledge, not in ddt-resistant drosophila.
nevertheless, ddt increased the activity of the pentose
phosphate pathway in ddt-susceptible drosophila by
increasing the activity of two key regulatory enzymes, which
increased the overall fitness of the flies (bijlsma and kerver,
1983).

in this strain is high (~1500-fold) and is due to multiple
energy-requiring mechanisms, including reduced
penetration, increased metabolism, and enhanced efflux
(strycharz et al., 2013), involving the up-regulation of at least
nine genes (gellatly et al., 2015; kim et al, 2018). thus, the
maintenance of such a high level of resistance through so
many energy-requiring mechanisms undoubtedly places a

resistance and the potential discovery of an “achilles’ heel”
against pesticide resistance in this pathway.
abstract

insecticide resistance is an ongoing challenge in agriculture
and disease vector control. here, we demonstrate a novel
strategy to attenuate resistance. we used genomics tools to
target fundamental energy-associated pathways and
identified a potential “achilles’ heel” for resistance, a
resistance-associated protein that, upon inhibition, results in
a substantial loss in the resistance phenotype. specifically, we
compared the gene expression profiles and structural

ions of the insulin/insulin-like growth factor signaling
(iis) pathway genes in ddt-susceptible (91-c) and -resistant
(91-r) drosophila melanogaster (drosophila) strains. a total of
eight and seven iis transcripts were up- and down-regulated,
respectively, in 91-r compared to 91-c. a total of 114

vari.

 

(91-r) drosophila melanogaster (drosophila) strains. a total of
eight and seven iis transcripts were up- and down-regulated,
respectively, in 91-r compared to 91-c. a total of 114
nonsynonymous mutations were observed between 91-c and
91-r, of which 51.8% were fixed. among the differentially
expressed transcripts, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase
(pepck), down-regulated in 91-r, encoded the greatest
number of amino acid changes, prompting us to perform
pepck inhibitor-pesticide exposure bioassays. the inhibitor
of pepck, hydrazine sulfate, resulted in a 161- to 218-fold
decrease in the ddt resistance phenotype (91-r) and more
than a 4- to 5-fold increase in susceptibility in 91-c. a second
target protein, glycogen synthase kinase 3b (gsk3b-po), had
one amino acid difference between 91-c and 91-r, and the
corresponding transcript was also down-regulated in 91-r. a
gsk3b-po inhibitor, lithium chloride, likewise reduced the
resistance but to a lesser extent than did hydrazine sulfate for
pepck. we demonstrate the potential role of iis genes in ddt
resistance and the potential discovery of an “achilles’ heel”
against pesticide resistance in this pathway.
