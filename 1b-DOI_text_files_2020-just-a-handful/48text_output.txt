5. conclusion

in this study, we investigated differences in the activity of 10
leg muscles between 2-legged and 1-legged pedaling. as
hypothesized, with only 1 leg, the flexion-related muscle
activities in the upstroke phase increased to produce crank
torque to compensate for the absence of the contralateral leg.
in contrast, downstroke crank torque and extension-related
muscle activities were reduced to satisfy the constant power
task constraint and to maintain smooth crank motion. the
observed changes in muscle activities with 1-legged pedaling
are due to a variety of changes in mechanical aspects of the
pedaling motion, including altered crank torque patterns
within the crank cycle, reduced pelvis stability, and the need
for increased knee and ankle stiffness during the upstroke.

4.3. limitations

one limitation of this study was the reduction in overall
crank torque and power output (about 15%) in one-l, despite
relatively good participant adherence to the target 180°/s
average crank velocity. the 1-legged torque and power deficit
is consistent with findings in a previous 1-legged pedaling
study.” however, qualitative examination of individual
participant data demonstrates that muscle activity changes
is consistent with findings in a previous 1-legged pedaling
study.” however, qualitative examination of individual
participant data demonstrates that muscle activity changes
between two-l and one-l were more distinctly related to
crank torque and velocity profiles and quadrant-specific
changes than to differences in average crank mechanics. this
finding suggests that differences within specific portions of
the crank cycle were driving muscular responses to a greater
extent than the average crank demands and are mainly
responsible for the muscle activity differences between two-
land one-l.

the results of this study do not necessarily extend to
muscular control in 1-legged pedaling tasks with different
mechanical demands; our participants were asked to perform
pedaling tasks with relatively low crank torque and velocity.
these low mechanical demands were based on our previous
work in which participants were able to perform repeated 1-
legged pedaling trials without significant muscle fatigue.!' at
faster pedaling rates, participants were unable to pedal
smoothly with 1 leg due to freewheeling, consistent with a
leggeu peudiiny urals wiuiuut s1gtiinicanie ifusuie fauigiie.- al
faster pedaling rates, participants were unable to pedal
smoothly with 1 leg due to freewheeling, consistent with a
previous study in which some participants found it difficult
to produce smooth 1-legged pedaling motion at higher crank
demands (80 rpm and 120 w).’ based on these observations,
the relatively low mechanical demands of 30 rpm and 30 w
were chosen for one-l. for the 2-legged pedaling trial, we
doubled power output to about 60 w, but kept the pedaling
rate at 30 rpm, thereby imposing similar mechanical demand
on the left leg in both two-l and one-l. therefore, muscle
activities from the left leg are comparable between the two-l
and one-l conditions, with similar muscle fatigue and
mechanical demand. although not commonly seen in
competitive cycling, slow pedaling rates (20-50 rpm) have
been used to examine impaired control and coordination in
stroke survivors.*? control of foot force in stroke survivors
has been examined while the crank arms are moving at 40
rpm. the relatively low mechanical demands we used
allowed us to focus on changes in muscle control related
mainly to the absence of contralateral leg involvement.

because of these low demands, our results may be
informative to clinicians.
4.2. changes in muscle activity in one-l

the redistribution of crank torque production and angular
velocity changes over the crank cycle are associated with
distinct muscle activity changes during one-l. lower crank
torque and acceleration in the downstroke phase was
getuury unaiges uver dic gain yur dic asuliateu wiur
distinct muscle activity changes during one-l. lower crank
torque and acceleration in the downstroke phase was
followed by increased torque and acceleration in the upstroke
phase. starting before bdc and continuing through the
upstroke, flexion-related muscles tfl, hamstrings, ta, and
mga significantly increased their activity to actively pull the
leg to accelerate the crank arm. after tdc, the downstroke
crank torque was reduced to prevent freewheeling under the
designated power output constraints, consistent with the
reduced activities of the extension-related muscles vl, vm,
sol, and lga, all of which play a major role in producing the
downstroke crank torque in 2-legged pedaling.2?°

 

one-legged pedaling also elicited several muscle use
adaptations that were not tied directly to the changes in
crank torque patterns, such as increased coactivation of
agonist and antagonist muscles at the ankle and knee joints
during the upstroke phase. in q3, the uni-articular knee
extensors and hamstrings simultaneously increased their
activity levels, while in q4 triceps surae muscles sol, mga,
and lga increased their activities together with the
extensors and hamstrings simultaneously increased their
activity levels, while in q4 triceps surae muscles sol, mga,
and lga increased their activities together with the
dorsiflexor ta. while the reason for this increased
antagonism in unclear, in the early stages of walking it has
been suggested that such antagonism increases stability at
the knee joint and lower leg,° in one-l, the muscular
coactivation could stiffen and stabilize the knee and ankle to
assist the active pull-up. with more practice, the antagonist
coactivation could possibly decrease,’ so future studies
should address whether this coactivation originates from an
acute adaptation to the relatively novel task or whether it is a
feature of 1-legged pedaling itself.

ta muscle activity was greater in early downstroke (q1) in
one-l, perhaps because of its synergisti tion with tfl
that would help to stabilize the pelvis; such an increase was
not shown in pedaling with independent crank arms.'? in our
data, the 1-legged tfl activity was not significantly greater in
q1 due to subject variability, although the mean iemg value
was more than 3 times larger than in two-l. the change in
data, the 1-legged tfl activity was not significantly greater in
qi due to subject variability, although the mean iemg value
was more than 3 times larger than in two-l. the change in
qu tfl activity pattern from two-l to one-l was similar to
that of the ta (fig. 2). those 2 muscles have been described
as synergists that are co-activated from mid-upstroke to early
downstroke in 2-legged pedaling.2>8 the lack of
contralateral leg motion in one-l emphasizes the need for
stabilizing the pelvis during the transition from leg flexion to
extension around tdc. one possible strategy is to activate the
tfl/ta synergists at greater amplitudes to keep the pelvis
steady from q4 into qi.

the lateral and medial heads of the gastrocnemius showed
slightly different adaptations to the 1-legged pedaling
condition, possibly due to lower leg positioning. a previous
study reported greater relative mga activity compared to lga
in a unilateral submaximal plantarflexion task with fully
extended knee.2° in pedaling, the knee is in an extended
position around bdc,'!° and the bicycle cleat places the foot

in slight external rotation, suggesting that the mga may be
preferentially activated around the bdc to produce the
required ankle and knee torques. in one-l, lga activity is
reduced in q2, consistent with the reduced q2 crank torque.
in contrast, q2 mga activity was the same in one-l as two-l,
continuing to generate knee flexion torque with synergistic
hamstring activity to produce the smooth transition into
upstroke at bdc.*! mga activity increased in q3 to assist the
active upstroke pulling, while lga activity increased but not
significantly compared to two-l.

 

 

 
4. discussion

all participants were able to produce smooth 1-legged and 2-
legged pedaling at the designated crank mechanical
demands. in one-l the absence of the contralateral leg
altered the profiles of crank torque and angular velocity,
accompanied by widespread changes in muscle activity
patterns and magnitudes. as hypothesized, activity levels of
extension-related muscles were decreased during the
downstroke, while flexion-related muscles increased activity
during the upstroke. unexpected findings included greater
activity in ta during q1, in the uni-articular knee extensors
during q3, and sol during q4. furthermore, the 2 heads of
gastrocnemius (mga, lga) demonstrated differing
adaptations to the use of only 1 leg in pedaling.

4.1. altered crank mechanics in one-l

in one-l without the use of the contralateral leg, crank
torque was reduced in the downstroke and switched from
negative to positive in the upstroke. the use of only 1 leg
resulted in greater fluctuation of the crank angular velocity
from the designated pedaling rate, consistent with a previous
report,° with a tendency for increased velocity near bdc and
a significant decrease in q4 before tdc. in contrast, pedal
angle profiles were very similar in one-l and two-l. because
there is minimal pelvis movement in seated 1-legged
pedaling,” leg joint kinematics were similar in the 1-legged
and 2-legged pedaling conditions. therefore, the altered
crank dynamics originated mainly from changes in muscle
activities and forces rather than postural adaptations.

3.1. pedal and crank dynamics

the patterns of pedal and crank dynamics were altered
significantly when pedaling with 1 leg compared to 2 legs
(fig. 1 and table 1). over the entire crank cycle, there was a
small but significant decrease in the average single-leg crank
torque production in one-l compared to two-l (a=-1.58
nem, p=0.003, d=-0.92). one-l crank torque was smaller in
qi (a=-11.98 n-m, p < 0.001, d=-2.22) and q2 (a=-7.83 nm,
p< 0.001, d=-1.76), but larger in q3 (a=8.79 n-m, p < 0.001,
d=4.26) and q4(a=4.71 n-m, p< 0.001, d=2.71). overall

ui (a=- 1698 nm, p <u.uu1, @=-2.22) and qz (a=-/.85 nm,
p< 0.001, d=-1.76), but larger in q3 (a=8.79 n-m, p < 0.001,
d=4.26) and q4(a=4.71 n-m, p< 0.001, d=2.71). overall
mean crank angular velocity and pedal angle were not
significantly different between the 2 conditions. however, in
4, crank velocity was lower in one-l (a=-14.38 */s,
p=0.003, d=-1.13) without the contralateral support, but
there was a tendency for increased velocity in q3 (a=5.76 °/s,
p=0.066, d=0.7). together, these findings suggest that
participants altered their normal 2-legged crank mechanics
when pedaling with 1 leg only.

ity patterns (fig. 2) were similar to
those described in other cycling studies.'”27? in two-l, the
uni-articular knee extensors vm and vl were active from
about 330° to 135° synergistically with the ankle
plantarflexor sol (about 0°-180°) to produce crank torque
during the downstroke. the hip flexor/knee extensor rectus
femoris was active during q4 and qi (about 270° to 90°), to.
help with a smooth transition through tdc. the biarticular
plantarflexor/knee flexor muscles (lga, mga) and hip
extensor/knee flexor hamstrings (bfl, st) were mainly active
in q2 and q3, helping to produce a similar smooth transition
at bdc. finally, the hip abductor/pelvis stabilizer tfl and
extensor/knee flexor hamstrings (bfl, st) were mainly active
in q2 and q3, helping to produce a similar smooth transition
at bdc. finally, the hip abductor/pelvis stabilizer tfl and
ankle dorsiflexor ta were synergistically active during the
late upstroke into early downstroke across tdc.

2.2. experimental task

two-legged and 1-legged pedaling trials were performed on
a standard road bicycle attached to a computerized
ergometer (velodyne; schwinn bicycle, chicago, il, usa). the
bicycle seat was adjusted to about 95% of hip-pedal distance
in the lowest pedal position. participants wore bicycle shoes
with look delta cleats to securely connect the feet and
pedals, with enough practice at attachment and detachment
to become comfortable with their use.

participants first stretched and completed a 2-min, 2-legged
warm-up pedaling session at 60 rpm and about 60 w. after a
1-min break, each participant performed a 2-min, 2-legged
pedaling trial (labeled as “two-l") at 30 rpm and about 60 w.
two-l was followed by four 45-s, 1-legged pedaling trials at
30 rpm and about 30 w separated by 1-min rest intervals,
with 30 w chosen to match the single-leg output of the 60 w
two-l condition. each 1-legged trial was initiated by 2-
legged pedaling for about 15 s to achieve the designated
pedaling rate, followed by about 30 s of pedaling only with
their left leg. at about 13 s, participants detached and placed
their right leg on a nearby high-friction nonslip support
where it would not interfere with crank rotation or invoke
pelvis misalignment. participants were instructed to maintain
a constant crank angular velocity at 30 rpm, which required a
mean crank torque of about 9.5 n-m. this resulted in crank
power output at about 30 w, a load at which crank
“freewheeling” (no rear wheel resistance) and hip flexor
muscle fatigue are minimized." in each trial, only the last 25
s of data were analyzed to exclude the 2-legged to 1-legged

help them maintain the specified target velocity.

 

2.3. data collection and analysis

applied left pedal forces were measured with kistler
piezoelectric load washers." digital optical encoders
(resolution=0.35°, ls7184; us digital, vancouver, wa, usa)
were used to measure left crank arm and pedal angular
positions. surface bipolar emg electrodes (delsys trigno
wireless system; delsys inc., natick, ma, usa) were placed
according to the surface electromyography for the non-
invasive assessment of muscles guidelines'® on 10 muscles of
the left leg (after proper skin cleaning by shaving and alcohol
wipe): tensor fasciae latae (tfl), rectus femoris, biceps

(vl), vastus medialis (vm), lateral gastrocnemius (lga),
medial gastrocnemius (mga), soleus (sol), and tibialis
anterior (ta). all force, angle, and emg data were collected
synchronously at 1000 hz with an a/d convertor (usb-6259;
national instruments, austin, tx, usa) connected to a
desktop computer running a customized labview program
(labview 2012; labview, national instruments).

  

force and angle data were smoothed with a fourth-order,
low-pass, zero-lag butterworth digital filter (matlab,
mathworks, natick, ma, usa), using 1-hz (crank angle) and
4-hz (pedal force and angle data) cutoff frequencies." crank
angular velocity was computed from the filtered angle data
by the central difference method. pedal angles were
computed relative to horizontal (0°), with positive angles
representing toe down pedal positions. the pedal forces were
projected from the pedal coordinate system into the global
coordinate system, with anterior and vertical downward
pedal forces considered positive. emg data were de-trended,
band-pass filtered (20-450 hz), and rectified before low-pass
coordinate system, with anterior and vertical downward
pedal forces considered positive. emg data were de-trended,
band-pass filtered (20-450 hz), and rectified before low-pass
filtering at 6 hz” with a 4th-order, 0-lag butterworth digital
filter to produce emg linear envelopes (emg_les). crank
angular velocity, pedal forces, and emg_les were expressed
in 1° crank angle intervals (360 points per crank cycle) using
cubic spline interpolation. after interpolation, the pedal force
vector component perpendicular to the crank arm was
calculated and multiplied by the crank arm length (0.17 m) to
compute crank torque from the left leg pedal force (single-leg
crank torque).

the number of complete crank revolutions varied between
trials, with a minimum of 7 across all trials and participants.
therefore, for each trial the last 7 consecutive crank cycles
were used to compute mean pedal angle, crank angular
velocity, crank torque, and emg curves. each muscle emg_le
was normalized by the mean of the two-l trial peak
amplitudes to facilitate comparisons of muscle activity
amplitudes between trials. crank angular velocity and torque
was normalized by the mean of the two-l trial peak
amplitudes to facilitate comparisons of muscle activity
amplitudes between trials. crank angular velocity and torque
data were integrated over each complete crank cycle and
quadrant (qu: 0°-90°; q2: 90°-180°; q3: 180°-270°; q4:
270°-360°; fig. 1) to evaluate mechanical demand, while the
emg_le data were integrated to quantify muscle activity
(iemg). the terms “top-dead-center” (tdc) and “bottom-
dead-center” (bdc) refer to the 0° and 180° crank positions,
respectively.

1. introduction

during normal bicycle pedaling with 2 legs, crank torque is
generated mainly during the downstroke phase of each leg
when the leg extensor muscles are active in the first half of
the 360° crank cycle.! in the subsequent upstroke phase that
completes the crank cycle, the majority of the crank torque is
produced by the simultaneous contralateral leg downstroke,
with only a small contribution from ipsilateral flexor
muscles.’ for training and rehabilitation purposes, riders
sometimes engage in 1-legged pedaling with crank torque
generated onlv bv 1 leg. emphasizing.the need for ipsilateral
muscles.’ for training and rehabilitation purposes, riders
sometimes engage in 1-legged pedaling with crank torque
generated only by 1 leg, emphasizing the need for ipsilateral
upstroke flexor activity to generate crank torque and produce
smooth pedaling motion over the entire crank cycle.
therefore, 1-legged pedaling requires cyclists to alter how
they control multiple extensor and flexor leg muscles during
the crank cycle. as such, 1-legged pedaling has been
suggested as a training tool to improve pedaling
performance? and is used in clinical settings for
rehabilitation.‘ it has been suggested that 1-legged pedaling
is a good tool for evaluating stroke patients in pedal force
production’ and for evaluating leg strength and endurance.

the few studies that have compared 1-legged and 2-legged
pedaling have found differences in both kinetics and
kinematics.7, 8, 9 for example, with 1-legged pedaling the
proportion of mechanical work is lower in the downstroke
and higher in the upstroke compared to 2-legged pedaling.”
others report that 1-legged pedaling has smaller peak hip
extensor torques but larger peak knee flexor and ankle

and higher in the upstroke compared to 2-legged pedaling.’
others report that 1-legged pedaling has smaller peak hip
extensor torques but larger peak knee flexor and ankle
dorsiflexor torques, which is associated with a larger flexion
angle of the knee joint at the bottom of the crank cycle.'°
these kinetic changes are accompanied by greater variation
in crank angular velocity throughout the crank cycle in 1-
legged pedaling (-30% to 20% of the mean) than in 2-legged
pedaling (-10% to 10%),° with crank speed ranging from about
35 to 60 revolutions per minute (rpm) at the start and end of
leg extension during 1-legged pedaling.

the modified joint and crank dynamics in 1-legged pedaling
are accompanied by alterations in muscular control as
measured by electromyography (emg). one study found
increased overall activity in 5 major leg muscles in 1-legged
pedaling compared to 2-legged.® changes in activity of
specific muscles have been shown after learning to direct
pedal forces in a 1-legged pedaling task," but this study did

not include a 2-legged condition, with direct comparisons
only between 1-legged pedaling before and after practice in
their pedal force directing task. furthermore, these studies®!
examined activity from only 6 leg muscles, thus limiting their
view of the extent of the adaptation. a related study on
single-leg pedaling’ investigated activity in more leg
muscles (n=10), but these participants pedaled with 2 legs
using mechanically independent crank arms. in true 1-legged
pedaling, the leg motions are distinctly asymmetrical, with
the contralateral leg providing little mechanical support for
the pelvis while the ipsilateral leg produces crank torque. the
protocol with independent crank arms involves less
kinematic and kinetic asymmetry between legs and better
pelvis support during ipsilateral crank torque production.
furthermore, it has been shown that sensory feedback from
the contralateral leg may affect muscle activities of the
ipsilateral leg in 1-legged pedaling.

 

therefore, the aim of this study was to examine and compare
activity in 10 leg muscles while participants performed both

perform 2-legged pedaling with crank dynamics of 30 rpm
and about 60 watt (w), and equivalent 1-legged pedaling at
30 rpm and about 30 w. based on previous studies, we
hypothesized that 1-legged pedaling would exhibit greater
upstroke activity in the hip, knee, and ankle flexor muscles,
while downstroke extensor muscle activities would be
reduced in magnitude.

overall, the prescribed constant power requirements led to
reduced downstroke crank torque and extension-related
muscle activities (vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, and
soleus) in 1-legged pedaling. flexion-related muscle activities
(biceps femoris long head, semitendinosus, lateral
gastrocnemius, medial gastrocnemius, tensor fasciae latae,
and tibialis anterior) in the upstroke phase increased to
compensate for the absence of contralateral leg crank torque.
during the upstroke,
hamstrings and uni-articular knee extensors, and in the ankle
plantarflexors and dorsiflexors. at the top of the crank cycle,
greater hip flexor activity stabilized the pelvis.

conclusion

the observed changes in muscle activities are due to a variety
of changes in mechanical aspects of the pedaling motion
when pedaling with only 1 leg, including altered crank torque
patterns without the contralateral leg, reduced pelvis
stability, and increased knee and ankle stiffness during the
upstroke.

 
background

one-legged pedaling is of interest to elite cyclists and
clinicians. however, muscular usage in 1-legged vs. 2-legged
pedaling is not fully understood. thus, the study was aimed
to examine changes in leg muscle activation patterns
between 2-legged and 1-legged pedaling.

 

methods

fifteen healthy young recreational cyclists performed both 1-
legged and 2-legged pedaling trials at about 30 watt per leg.
surface electromyography electrodes were placed on 10
major muscles of the left leg. linear envelope
electromyography data were integrated to quantify muscle
activities for each crank cycle quadrant to evaluate muscle
activation changes.
