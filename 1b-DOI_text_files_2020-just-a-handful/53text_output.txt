6. summary

complex coacervates are a novel materials platform for the
encapsulation and delivery of a wide range of materials,
including proteins. we have discussed strategies for
understanding the phase behavior associated with the
coacervation of polymeric systems in the absence and
presence of protein, along with methods for measuring the
concentration of protein in coacervate samples. here we have
shown that it is possible to use established methods and
adapt them to coacervate systems for protein analysis.
5. analysis and statistics

to facilitate statistical analysis, repeat samples and replicate
experiments should be performed at least three times. a
standard t-test or anova may be used for comparison
between assay results.

moving beyond raw data to calculated values such as the
concentration of protein in the coacervate phase, the
encapsulation efficiency, partitioning, etc., require
propagation of error. furthermore, propagation of error
should be considered when performing baseline subtraction.
to obtain an equation for the propagated error use:

ic ®)

6r= (

   

 

6r= (262)" + (284y) +... (9)

where r is the parameter whose error is being calculated and
is a function of x, y, etc. the partial derivative of r for a
specific independent variable is multiplied by the error of
that variable and the whole quantity squared. this is done for
each variable for which r is dependent and summed together.
finally, the square root of the summation is taken and that is
the error for r. for example, the propagated error associated
with performing a baseline subtraction between averaged
values of the sample and baseline absorbance is:

faavgd (10)

= (bg laove = 0958)" + (ge (aawy = bang)

this type of calculation should be performed for each
mathematical manipulation performed during data analysis.
when using a standard curve, there is an associated error
with the fit, which should be included using error
mathematical manipulation performed during data analysis.
when using a standard curve, there is an associated error
with the fit, which should be included using error
propagation. this error can be determined by using eq. 9.
table 5 shows an example recipe for a standard curve is
outlined in fig. 5, fig. 6 to create a curve that would place the
target concentration in the middle of the range at ph 7.0 in
10mm hepes. the goal is to create a linear curve over the
desired range of concentrations using the bradford. a curve

for both the supernatant and coacervate phases is required.
the supernatant will have the conditions set by sample
preparation, while the coacervate phase will necessitate
whatever conditions are used to dismantle the dense phase,
i.e., 2m nacl. to convert table 5 from samples related to the

 

supernatant phase to those from the coacervate phase,
replace the total volume of buffer (hepes) and water with an
equal amount of salt.

for all of the methods described, it is necessary to create a
standard curve to determine the concentration of protein
from the measured absorbance signal. while bsa is

for all of the methods described, itis necessary to createa
standard curve to determine the concentration of protein
from the measured absorbance signal. while bsa is
commonly used as a protein standard to generate a
“universal” set of standard curves, the colorimetric signal
from the coomassie dye and/or the absorbance at 280nm can
vary widely from protein to protei
solution conditions. thus, we advise the creation of a
standard curve for each protein at every set of experimental
conditions used. table 4 outlines limits for several common
buffers, salts, etc., for the bradford assay and 280nm
(stoscheck, 1990), generally speaking, measurements at
280nm are sensitive to molecules that have double bonds
between carbons or carbon and oxygen (stoscheck, 1990),
while the bradford assay does not tolerate high
concentrations of detergents (olson & markwell, 2007).

the use of a program to calculate protein concentration using
absorbance at 280nm may have correction calculations,
appropriate reading of the literature and user guides will help
determine such corrections. if it is suspected that the protein
sample has nucleic contamination, eq. 8 may be used for an
approximate determination: (olson & markwell, 2007;
stoscheck, 1990):

[protein](mg / ml)=(1.55 # a2so)—(0.76 & a260) (8)

however, a potentially simpler method for protein
quantification at 280nm is to create a standard curve of the
protein. this is useful for systems that employ various buffer
conditions that may affect results and does not require a
nanodrop program or use of an extinction coefficient.

4, pipette a sufficient volume of a concentrated stock

9. convert the measured absorbance values to protein

4.11. utilizing absorbance at 280nm

while the bradford assay is performed using a colorimetric
readout, measuring absorbance at 280nm (a280) requires
special consideration. many standard well plates and
disposable cuvettes may not be suited for this method as
many plastics absorb in the uv. specialized plastic cuvettes,
quartz cuvettes, and small volume absorbance setups such as
the nanodrop or take3 should be used for these
measurements.

the linear range of concentrations measurable by absorbance
at 280nm generally extends from ~20 to -3000yg/ml
(simonian, 2002). however, the specific measurable range

the linear range of concentrations measurable by absorbance
at 280nm generally extends from ~20 to ~3000yg/ml
(simonian, 2002). however, the specific measurable range
will be a function of the extinction coefficient for a given
protein, in tandem with potential background interference
from other components of the solution, as well as the path
length of the sample. for example, the standard range for the
small volume nanodrop system is between 0.1 and
400mg/ml for bsa, which has an extinction coefficient of
43,824m-'cm"', assuming a molecular weight of 66.4kda
(thermo scientific, 2010). however, this range can be heavily
influenced by the presence of other molecules present in
solution, such as salt, buffer, surfactants, etc. table 3 lists the

maximum allowable concentration for a range of common

 

 

chemicals related to these absorbance measurements.

in the specific context of complex coacervate samples, it is
important to test whether or not the polyelectrolytes used to
form the coacervate absorb at 280nm. while it is possible to
perform a background subtraction to account for signal
associated with the polyelectrolytes, this correction can

the extinction coefficient can be found using programs such
as protparam or looking into the literature (gasteiger et al.,
2005). if there is no known extinction coefficient and no
sequence, a standard assumption is that an absorbance
reading of 1.0 is equal to 1mg/ml based on a 0.1% or 1mg/ml
protein concentration producing an absorbance at 280nm of
1.0 with a path length of 10mm or 1cm (stoscheck, 1990).

in addition to considering the specific interactions of the

conditions, it is critical to determine the potential

 

ferent solution

 

 

coomassie dye with the protein at different solution
conditions, it is critical to determine the potential
background signal that might result from the dye interacting
with the polymers used in the coacervate. while the
interaction of the dye with poly(1-lysine) and poly(o,.-
glutamate) has been shown to be minimal (blocher mctigue
& perry, 2019), much stronger interactions occur when more
hydrophobic polymers such as poly(styrene sulfonate) (pss),
poly(diallyldimethylammonium chloride) (pdadmac), and
methacrylate-based polyelectrolytes. the interaction
between polymer and dye can be tested by mixing a 1:1
volume ratio of the dye with a solution of polymer at the
concentration intended for use in experiments. qualitatively,
a strong interaction between the dye and the polymers can
be observed visually as a color change from brackish-brown
to blue. quantitatively, it is important to consider whether
the level of background signal resulting from the polymers in
the coacervate will swamp the potential absorbance signal
from the protein by itself. this comparison can be done via an
absorbance measurement at 595nm. while it is possible to
tie coacervare will swamp the porentiar absorbance signal —
from the protein by itself. this comparison can be done via an
absorbance measurement at 595nm. while it is possible to
perform a background subtraction to account for signal
associated with the polyelectrolytes, this correction can
become complicated if the concentration of each of the
polymers varies across different samples.

the linear range of the bradford assay is a function of the
specific interaction of the protein with the coomassie dye,
and the volumetric scale (and thus the absorbance path
length) at which the experiment is performed. different scale
protocols have been developed for the bradford assay
depending on the desired sample volumes and the range of
concentrations. the main difference in the protocols is the
ratio of coomassie dye solution to protein sample. for
example, the “standard” bradford protocol uses a 50:1 ratio of
dye to sample, and has a typical range of ~125-1000yg/ml. in
contrast, the “micro assay” uses a 1:1 ratio of dye to sample
and has a linear range of approximately 1-10yg/ml (bio-rad
laboratories, n.d.). these ratios, as well as the sample path
jength can be tuned to optimize a protocol fora specific

and has a linear range of approximately 1-10yg/ml (bio-rad
laboratories, n.d.). these ratios, as well as the sample path
length can be tuned to optimize a protocol for a specific
protein target and/or solution condition. for more
information on the bradford assay, we encourage readers to
refer to bio-rad laboratories (n.d.) and olson and markwell
(2007).

for the example data shown in fig. 4 and table 3, we assayed
the uptake of bovine serum albumin (bsa) into coacervates
formed from poly(1-lysine) and poly(p..-glutamate) with a
degree of polymerization n=50, in 10mm hepes, ph 7.0. the
experiment tested the incorporation of 50yg/ml bsa as a
function of the charge stoichiometry of the two polymers. a
“micro assay” style bradford assay was used to quantify the
protein concentration in both the coacervate and the
supernatant phases. samples were prepared at a total volume
of 240pl, 105yl of which was used for turbidity
measurements (3 repeat samples of 35yl each), and 115 pl of
which was used for protein quantification. after separating
the coacervate and supernatant, protocols were developed

 

measurements (3 repeat samples of 35yl each), and 115pl of
which was used for protein quantification. after separating
the coacervate and supernatant, protocols were developed
separately for the two phases.

having measured the total volume of the supernatant for
each sample to facilitate future mass balance calculations,
115yl of supernatant was then aliquoted into a clean
microcentrifuge tube and combined with an equal volume
(115yl) of 1x coomassie dye. three repeat aliquots of 35yl
each were then pipetted into a 384-well plate for absorbance
measurements. the absorbance data were converted to
concentration values using a standard curve with samples
prepared in 10mm hepes, ph 7.0.

for the coacervate samples, visual inspection after
centrifugation had determined that the volume of coacervate
was very small (~0-2.2yl). we then added 70yl of 2.0m nacl
to disassemble the coacervate. this sample was then mixed
with an equal volume (70ql) of 1x coomassie dye. for these
samples, we chose to neglect the volume of our coacervate in

2.24 represents a ~3% volume error. three repeat aliquots of
35yl each were then pipetted into a 384-well plate for
absorbance measurements, as above. the absorbance data for
coacervate samples were converted to concentration using a
standard curve with samples prepared at a concentration of
2m nacl.

the data in fig. 4a show a strong peak in the turbidity at a
mole fraction of polycation of approximately 0.525. this peak
in the turbidity data corresponds directly with a strong
increase in the concentration of protein present in the
coacervate phase (to nearly 2.0mg/ml, or 2000yg/ml), and a
corresponding decrease in the protein from the supernatant
(fig. 4b). in contrast, for samples at the extremes of the
stoichiometric range where no phase separation occurred, we
recovered the expected value of 50g/ml bsa that was input
into the system.
4.9. bradford assay

the protein quantification experiments described here are
intended to be run in parallel with a stoichiometry-type
experiment, as described above, with half of the total sample
volume used for turbidity experiments, and the other half
used for protein quantification. as in the case of turbidity
experiments, it is important to measure both repeat and
replicate samples in order to allow for statistical analysis of
the results.

lly described as intera
acids in hydrophobic pockets, but primarily responds to
arginine residues, as well as histidine, tryptophan, tyrosine,
and phenylalanine to a lesser extent (bio-rad laboratories,
n.d.; olson & markwell, 2007; stoscheck, 1990). typically,
users buy a kit that may come with protein standards (e.g.,
bovine serum albumin, bsa) to aid in the creation of a
calibration curve. however, individual proteins interact
differently with the coomassie dye, based on their amino
acid sequence. therefore, we recommend creating calibration
curves directly with the protein of interest. furthermore, all
calibration curves must be prepared at the solution
conditions (ie., ph, salt concentration, etc.) expected in the
final sample. one consequence of this is that separate
calibration curves are required for supernatant samples,
which can be measured directly, and coacervate samples,
which must be performed at a higher salt concentration in
order to dismantle the coacervate (fig. 5).

4.8. quantifying protein incorporation into
complex coacervates

4.8. quantifying protein incorporation into
complex coacervates

while turbidity and optical microscopy can be used to
determine whether complexation has occurred or not, these
measurements do not provide information on the
incorporation of protein into the coacervate phase. instead,
separate measures of the protein concentration in the
coacervate and supernatant phases must be made, along with
a determination of the volume of each phase.

 

once the concentrations for both the coacervate and
supernatant phases are known, several other parameters may
be determined. the first is the encapsulation efficiency (ee),
which is the percentage of cargo (by mass) sequestered,
this case, by complex coacervates. measuring the supernatant
volume and multiplying by the concentration of protein in

the supernatant phase gives the mass of cargo in the
supernatant. subtracting this mass from the total mass of
protein added to the system during sample preparation
allows for calculation of the mass of protein in the coacervate
bes pr rare serre err are se thie gre ar ss or —

as the ratio of the concentration of proteil

4.6. polymer-polymer-protein salt resistance
experiments

salt resistance experiments can also be performed for
samples including proteins. however, most proteins would be
expected to have a lower charge content and charge density
than the associated polymers. as such, it is a reasonable
assumption that the salt resistance of the three-
macromolecule system should be lower than that of the

4.5. polymer-polymer-protein stoichiometry
experiments

the design of a stoichiometry experiment for a system that
combines protein in the presence of a polycation and
polyanion varies only slightly in design and intent. while
more extensive experiments that vary the relative amounts of
each polymer and the quantity of protein can be performed
to map out the complete phase behavior of this more
complex system, simpler experiments that consider the effect
of polymer charge stoichiometry in the presence of a
constant level of protein can also be performed (see table 3
for an example recipe). here, we will discuss the design of
these simpler experiments and how the addition of a protein
as a third charged macromolecule can alter the phase
behavior of the system.

the final monomer concentration is 7mm and the final protein

our initial stoichiometry experiments with just the two-
polymer system served to identify the composition
corresponding to maximum coacervate yield, corresponding
to a charge-neutral mixture of the two polymers. however,
the addition of a charged protein would be expected to shift
this optimal condition. as can be seen in fig. 4a, the addition
of negatively-charged bovine serum albumin (bsa) to a
mixture of poly(1-lysine) and poly(o,.-glutamate) degree of
polymerization n=5o, in 10mm hepes, ph 7.0 results in a
shift in the resulting turbidity signal to higher mole fractions
of the polycation. a shift in the opposite direction, to “net
negative” conditions would be expected for positively-
charged proteins (blocher mctigue & perry, 2019; lindhoud &
claessens, 2016; lindhoud, norde, & cohen stuart, 2009).

as for the two-polymer system, it is important to determine
whether the order of mixing has any effect on the resulting
coacervates.
4.3. polymer-polymer salt resistance experiments

the goal of salt resistance experiments is to identify the
concentration of salt (for a given total polymer concentration
and stoichiometric ratio) above which phase separation is no
longer observed. this provides information on the location of
the binodal curve, and informs the design of experimental
procedures where dissolution of the coacervate phase is
needed. the magnitude of the salt resistance is dependent
upon the length and identity of the polymers, the choice of
salt, the solution ph, etc. generally speaking, increases in
polymer length, hydrophobicity, and charge density will
result in higher values of the salt resistance at the same
polymer concentration.

it may be necessary to perform a screening-level experiment

in designing a salt resistance experiment for a new polymer,
it may be necessary to perform a screening-level experiment
to identify the general range of salt concentrations over
which the experiment should be performed. generally, the
salt resistance can be identified as a clear decrease in the
turbidity signal with increasing salt concentration. however,
it is useful to combine turbidimetry measurements with
direct visualization of the samples via optical microscopy to
confirm results. an example of salt resistance data for the
system of poly(.-lysine) and poly(n,.-glutamate) degree of
polymerization n=50, ph 7.0 is shown in fig. 2b.

a general step-by-step protocol for these polymer-only
experiments is given below.

while all experimental results should be replicated in order
to ensure reproducibility (iee., “technical” replicates), we also
recommend that samples be prepared in such a way that
each sample can be split and analyzed separately (a repeat
measurement of the sample, similar to a “biological”
replicate). the use of three replicates/repeats will allow for
the statistical analysis of the resulting data. in terms of
sample preparation, the total volume of sample prepared for
a repeated measurement should be >3x the volume needed
for the three individual samples. for example, 35yl of sample
is needed for a turbidity measurement using a 384-well plate.
however, to ensure that sufficient sample volume is available
for pipetting, a total sample volume of 120yl might be
prepared.

after turbidimetry, samples should be inspected visually
using an optical microscope. standard brightfield microscopy
with a 40x objective is typically sufficient for this procedure,
though more advanced techniques such as phase contrast or
differential interference contrast (dic) can enhance the
ability tovisualize samples far samples auepared bion cee
though more advanced techniques such as phase contrast or
differential interference contrast (dic) can enhance the
ability to visualize samples. for samples prepared at low
polymer concentration, it may be difficult to distinguish very
small droplets. the size of these coacervate droplets can be
increased either by increasing the polymer concentration
present in the sample, or by allowing the sample more time
for the droplets to coalesce. the main goals in visualizing
coacervate samples are to confirm the liquid vs. solid nature
of the resulting materials, and provide secondary
confirmation of trends (e.g., the presence or absence of
coacervates) suggested via turbidity. coacervate droplets
should appear as circular/spherical structures either floating
in solution or adhered onto a surface, whereas solid
precipitation typically appears as fractal aggregates (fig. 3).

4.1. characterizing coacervate phase behavior

while the ultimate goal of an experiment might be the
encapsulation of a target protein, we recommend first
characterizing the phase behavior of your coacervate system
in terms of charge stoichiometry and salt resistance. these
information will help in the planning of experiments related
to protein encapsulation and will facilitate the interpretation
of the resulting protein encapsulation data. these
experiments are typically performed at relatively low
concentrations of protein and polymer to limit reagent
requirements. all experiments can be scaled up in terms of
volumes and/or concentrations, though it is important to
ensure that all samples are fully mixed and equilibrated.

 

4.2. polymer-polymer stoichiometry experiments

stoichiometry experiments examine coacervate formation as
a function of the ratio of polycation to polyanion at constant
polymer concentration. thus, while polymer stock solutions

polymer concentration, thus, while polymer stock solutions
can be prepared at any concentration, we recommend the use
of ionizable monomer concentration on a molar basis. the

use of monomer concentration circumvents issues with
polymer polydispersity, and allows for the easy analysis of
results in terms of the stoichiometry of electrostatic
interactions. a stock solution concentration of 10mm
monomer is generally sufficient for turbidity experiments.

a typical stoichiometry experiment will span the range of
possible charge fractions, which we will express in terms of
the mole fraction of ionizable monomers of the polycation
present in our sample, to observe both a peak in the data, and
clear baselines. the data in fig. 3, fig. 4 and the experimental
recipes listed in table 1, table 2 span the range of 0.1-0.9.
these data points can be equally spaced for initial
experiments. however, once the location of the turbidity
peak is known (or if its location is estimated based on the
charge state of the polymers), it is useful to sample the
concentration space around the peak more closely.
additionally, it is important to ensure that the final polymer

concentration space around the peak more closely.
additionally, it is important to ensure that the final polymer
concentration in the prepared samples results in a
sufficiently high level of turbidity. this signal should be
distinguishable from that of a blank solution at the same
salt/buffer concentration, but in the absence of polymer. in
our experience, samples should be prepared at a final
concentration of at least 1 mm (with respect to the total
number of monomers), though this threshold concentration
is a function of the path length through the sample.

the final monomer concentration is 1mm.

to facilitate the preparation of fully equilibrated coacervate
samples, we recommend that any salt, buffer, and excess
water are combined first, followed by the addition of one of
the polymers. it is then important to ensure that the sample
is well mixed (e.g., vortexing for 5~10s) before the second
polymer is added, and that the sample is mixed again after
the addition of the second polymer. it is also possible to
prepare the polymer stock solutions at a specified
concentration of salt/buffer, thereby eliminating the need to
add these components separately, though this approach is
less flexible in terms of adjusting experimental parameters.
concentration of salt/buffer, thereby eliminating the need to
add these components separately, though this approach is
less flexible in terms of adjusting experimental parameters.
once samples have been prepared, they should be mixed well
and transferred to a well plate or cuvette for turbidity
analysis. an example turbidity result for a stoichiometry
experiment between poly(t-lysine) and poly(o,.-glutamate),
degree of polymerization n=50, ph 7.0 is shown in fig. 2a.
the coacervate samples, as formed, should be a dispersion of
droplets that gives the sample a cloudy and possibly
opalescent appearance. at this point, the time between
sample preparation and analysis is an important
consideration, as the coacervate droplets can coalesce and
settle over time and thus give variable turbidity readings.
generally, the turbidity signal should not be sensitive to
differences of a few minutes, though this time scale can vary
ficantly based on the identity of the polymer system and
the solution conditions.

these techniques are safe to perform in a standard laboratory
setting with the use of appropriate personal protection
equipment such as safety glasses, lab coats, and gloves. it is
recommended that experiments involving coomassie dye be
performed inside a chemical fume hood. for specific
materials, refer to the safety data sheets.

to keep solutions sterile and dust free, keep the lids on all
reagents, removing the lid only when pipetting, placing the
cap back each time, though the lid may remain loose.
imilarly, we recommend keeping all microcentrifuge tubes
closed except when adding solution or transferring samples.
the presence of dust can alter turbidity results. care should
also be taken to avoid cross-contamination of samples from
pipette tips.

 
2. materials, equipment, and reagents

the materials required for these experiments include two
oppositely-charged polyelectrolytes, a protein of interest, salt,
buffer (if desired), and acid/base for ph adjustments. we
recommend that all solutions of polymer, protein, buffer (if
desired) and salt be adjusted to the same ph. coomassie
brilliant blue g-250 dye can be purchased alone or as part of
a bradford assay kit.

samples will be prepared via pipetting in microcentrifuge
tubes and transferred into well plates (96- or 384-well plates
are common). we recommend the use of a vortex mixer
during sample preparation, an optical microscope for sample
tubes and transferred into well plates (96- or 384-well plates
are common). we recommend the use of a vortex mixer
during sample preparation, an optical microscope for sample
visualization, and a plate reader with uv/vis
spectrophotometry capabilities. it is also possible to perform
samples in cuvettes using a uv/vis spectrophotometer.
turbidity measurements are typically performed at a
wavelength of light in the middle of the visible spectrum, and
away from the absorbance peak of any of the materials
(-562nm is common). for quantifying the concentration of
protein present, the coomassie dye used in the bradford
assay is analyzed at a wavelength of 595nm, and the
experiment can be performed in a well plate, cuvette, or
other small volume uv/vis setup (e.g., nanodrop). the use of
absorbance at 280nm requires the use of either uv-
compatible cuvettes or a nanodrop-type setup.
these same trends can be observed through a
“stoichiometry” experiment, which typically uses turbidity to
determine the polymer ratio that gives maximum coacervate
yield (chollakup, beck, dirnberger, tirrell, & eisenbach, 2013;
chollakup, smitthipong, eisenbach, & tirrell, 2010;
cummings & obermeyer, 2018; obermeyer, mills, dong,
flores, & olsen, 2016; perry, li, priftis, leon, & tirrell, 2014;
priftis, megley, laugel, & tirrell, 2013; priftis & tirrell, 2012).
a stoichiometry experiment varies the relative amount of
polycation to polyanion while keeping the total polymer
concentration constant (corresponding to the gray lines in
fig. 1a and b). for systems where the polycation and
polyanion can be considered as fully ionized (or have equal
levels of ionization), the peak in the turbidity would be
expected at a mole fraction of 0.5 with respect to one of the
polymer species, or a 1:1 equimolar ratio (fig. 1d, red curve).
however, if one of the polymer species is only half charged,
in the observed signal. for instance,

 
 

 

~1d, red curve).
however, if one of the polymer species is only half charged,
this will result in a shift in the observed signal. for instance,
in the example shown in fig. 1b where only half of the
monomers on the polycation are ionized, a turbidity peak
would be observed at a charge fraction of 0.67, corresponding
to the condition where two cationic monomers are needed
for every one anionic monomer, or a 1:2 ratio (fig. 1d, blue
curve). this condition of charge neutrality identifies the point
where the maximum number of polymer chains will be
incorporated into the coacervate phase; complexation will
still occur at off stoichiometric conditions, but with a
decreased level of coacervation. from a theoretical
perspective, the composition of the bulk coacervate phase
should be the same, with the difference being purely one of
yield. however, experimentally, the preparation of off-
stoichiometry dispersions of coacervate droplets can result in
the recruitment of excess polymer to the surface of the
droplet, imparting colloidal stability (perry et al., 2014; priftis
& tirrell, 2012).

& tirrell, 2012).

fora given ratio of polycation-to-polyanion, the phase
diagram for coacervation is then shown as a one-dimensional
inodal curve, typically as a function of salt and total polymer
concentration (fig. 1c). this binodal curve represents the
slice through the larger two-dimensional phase space at
constant polymer composition (ice, the black line). samples
prepared at a composition within this two-phase region will
phase separate into two liquid phases, the polymer-rich
coacervate phase and the polymer-poor supernatant phase.
the composition of the resulting coacervate and supernatant
phases is defined by the tie-line that connects these two
points. one interesting (and potentially unintuitive) result of
this phase behavior is that increasing the amount of polymer
present in the initial sample mixture will not result in a
commensurate increase in the polymer concentration in the
resulting coacervate phase. instead, samples prepared at
different points along the tie-line will result in samples with
different quantities of the same coacervate phase, as defined

 

 

 

 

different points along the tie-line will result in samples with
different quantities of the same coacervate phase, as defined
by the lever rule. samples prepared at higher polymer
concentrations will result in a larger coacervate volume, and
vice versa.

there are numerous strategies for weakening or completely
overcoming the interactions that cause complex
coacervation. for example, changes in the solution ph or the
addition of an excess of one of the polymers can shift the
solution conditions outside of the two-phase window
(comert & dubin, 2017; kaibara, okazaki, bohidar, & dubin,
2000). as suggested by fig. 1a-c, ionic strength is also an
important variable for controlling coacervation (lindhoud, de
vries, et al., 2009; lindhoud, voorhaar, et al., 2009; perry et
al., 2014), the addition of salt can facilitate screening of the
electrostatic interactions and reduces the entropic gains
associated with complexation (perry et al., 2014; yan et al.,
2013). however, it is important to define the conditions for
which this salt dissolution is being defined. as shown in fig.
1c, the critical point is the highest salt concentration for
2013). however, it is important to define the conditions for
which this salt dissolution is being defined. as shown in fig.
1c, the critical point is the highest salt concentration for
which phase separation can be observed. however, most
experiments do not operate near the critical condition and
are therefore interested in determining the concentration of
salt above which phase separation is no longer observed for a
given sample condition. this salt concentration is typically
referred to as the salt resistance (li et al., 2018; madinya,
chang, perry, & sing, 2020), and is dependent upon the choice
of polymers, the coacervate composition, and the identity of
the salt used. as was discussed regarding the effects of
polymer concentration on coacervate composition, the salt
resistance for any sample prepared along a given tie-line will
be the same. however because tie-lines for coacervation tend
to be non-horizontal (i.e., there is preferential partitioning of
salt out of the coacervate phase), it is possible to change the
salt resistance by changing polymer concentration, although
this usually requires a significant change so as to move off of
one tie-line and onto another (chang et al., 2017). in the
context of encapsul.

this usually requires a significant change so as to move off of
one tie-line and onto another (chang et al., 2017). in the
context of encapsulation studies, the salt resistance is an
important parameter because it determines the
concentration of salt required to dismantle the coacervate.

this introduction is intended to provide a foundational
understanding of coacervate phase behavior to facilitate the
use of coacervation for protein encapsulation. thus far, our
discussion has focused on complex coacervates formed from
two species, a polycation and a polyanion. while the addition
of protein does not alter these design rules, the chemical
complexity of proteins can make interpretation of,
experimental data more challenging. for instance, most
proteins carry a mixture of positive and negative charges.
while electrostatic intuition would dictate that we consider
only the net charge of a protein, there are examples where
clustering of charges has allowed for complex coacervation to
occur “on the wrong side of the isoelectric point,” such that it
would appear that complexation is occurring between two
species of the same charge (comert, malanowski

 

 

occur “on the wrong side of the isoelectric point” such that it
would appear that complexation is occurring between two
species of the same charge (comert, malanowski, azarikia, &
dubin, 2016; cooper, dubin, kayitmazer, & turksen, 2005; xu,
liu, faisal, si, & guo, 2017; xu, mazzawi, chen, sun, & dubin,
2011). itis also common to explore coacervation between a
protein and two oppositely-charged polymers, particularly
for cases where the protein of interest is only weakly charged
(blocher mctigue & perry, 2019; lindhoud & claessens, 2016;
lindhoud, de vries, et al., 2009; lindhoud, voorhaar, et al.,
2009). in these cases it is necessary to consider the net
charge of all three species, and to carefully balance the ionic
strength of the system, as changes in the salt concentration
will disfavor the incorporation of the more weakly charged
protein in favor of stronger electrostatic interactions between
the two more strongly charged polymers.

strategies to characterize the coacervation phase behavior of

and can be adapted to fit specific situations, such as the
complexation of a protein with only a single, oppositely-
charged polymer.

1.2. complex coacervate phase behavior

there are many variables that alter the ability of
polyelectrolytes to undergo complex coacervation, including
the salt concentration, ph, charge density and chemistry of
the polymers, etc. here, we will describe an experimental
strategy for characterizing aspects of the phase behavior of
complex coacervates, without consideration for other
formulation-relevant questions such as the size and temporal
stability of a dispersion of coacervate droplets etc. one
consequence of this experimental focus is the use of
tormulation-relevant questions such as the size and temporal
stability of a dispersion of coacervate droplets etc. one
consequence of this experimental focus is the use of
concentration on an ionizable monomer basis, rather than
units of mass of polymer per volume that are more typical
when considering polymeric materials. furthermore, this
discussion assumes that the coacervate materials in question
are able to fully equilibrate (ie., form liquid droplets, rather
than kinetically-trapped gels or solid complexes).

 

complex coacervation involves the interaction of oppositely-
charged polyelectrolytes. thus, while physical and chemical
aspects of the polymer such as length, charge density and/or
degree of ionization, as well as hydrophobicity can modulate
the phase behavior, we can typically rely on general intuition
regarding electrostatic effects and charge neutrality. for
complex coacervation, the ability to phase separate will be
maximized when an equal number of oppositely-charged
groups are present. while this condition may be
straightforward to predict with some simple polymer
systems, factors such as ph-dependent degree of ionization

 

straightforward to predict with some simple polymer
systems, factors such as ph-dependent degree of ionization
can play a role. these effects are highlighted in fig. 1a and b,

which show schematic depictions of a two-dimensional
phase diagram as a function of the concentration of
polycation and polyanion, with the concentration of salt
present in the system defining the contours. the height (
salt stability) of the two-phase region is maximized along the
line of equimolar charge (black line). for systems where all of,
the potentially ionizable monomers are charged, this results
in a symmetric phase diagram (fig. 1a). however, if the ph of
the solution has been changed such that only half of the
ionizable groups on one of the polymers are charged (e.g., the
apparent pka of the polycation), then the phase diagram
becomes asymmetric, as in fig. 1b.

1.1. complex coacervation and protein
incorporation

complexation occurs when oppositely-charged
polyelectrolytes interact under favorable conditions such that
the electrostatic attraction and entropic gains can drive phase
separation. coacervation is a purely aqueous strategy that can
also be leveraged for the triggerable release protein cargo
(lim, ping, & miserez, 2018; lindhoud, de vries, schweins,
cohen stuart, & norde, 2009); lindhoud, voorhaar, et al.,
2009. these materials are versatile and have been shown
usable for various delivery techniques such as an injectable
protein carrier (johnson and wang, 2013, johnson and wang,
2014; nishida, tamura, & yui, 20/8) and for oral delivery _

chapeau et al., 2017). this method will focus on using
complex coacervation as an aqueous protein encapsulation
technique, and experimental strategies related to
characterizing the concentration of protein present in such
formulations.

 

 

 
1. introduction

the encapsulation of proteins and other biomacromolecules
is an area of tremendous activity, as such materials are
finding increasing utility in applications such as drug
delivery, environmental remediation, personal care products
and biocatalysis. proteins are generally very sensitive to their
environment, and typical methods used for encapsulation can
decrease or even destroy the activity of these molecules.
complex coacervation is a method that can be used to
encapsulate proteins without using harsh conditions that
may denature the protein cargo. this method of sequestration
is a viable platform for a variety of different areas such as
food science (schmitt & turgeon, 2011; yeo, bellas, firestone,
langer, & kohane, 2005), personal care products (carvalho,
estevinho, & santos, 2016; martins, barreiro, coelho, &
rodrigues, 2014), and medicine (kuo et al., 2014), because of

abstract

complex coacervates have found a renewed interest in the
past few decades in various fields such as food and personal
care products, membraneless cellular compartments, the
origin of life, and, most notably, as a mode of transport and
stabilization of drugs. here, we describe general methods for
characterizing the phase behavior of complex coacervates
and quantifying the incorporation of proteins into these
phase separated materials.
