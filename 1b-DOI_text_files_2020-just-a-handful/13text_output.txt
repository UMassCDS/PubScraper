conclusions

in this study, we have developed a simple, rapid, and effective method to
engineer bacterial membranes with dna oligonucleotides. after several
minutes of incubation, a large number of dna strands can be readily modified
onto these bacterial membranes. the membrane density of dna can be
rationally tuned based on the choice of lipid-dna conjugates and their initial

concentrations. as high as 0.4-0.7 dna insertion per nm
be achieved on various gram-negative and gram-positive bacterial species.
these membrane-anchored dnas are still available for hybridization and can
stay on the membranes for a long period of time. in addition, these lipid-
rationally tuned based on the choice of lipid-dna conjugates and their initial

these membrane-anchored dnas are still available for hybridization and can
stay on the membranes for a long period of time. in addition, these lipid-
mediated dna modifications have interesting selectivity on the bacterial
membranes. by fine-tuning the hydrophobicity of the lipid moieties, targeted
bacterial membrane engineering can be achieved for potential diagnostic and
biomedical applications.

this study can potentially largely extend the applications of dna
nanotechnology in the field of microbiology. with the help of these lipid-dna
conjugates, versatile dna scaffolds, structures, and devices can now be
functionalized onto various types of bacterial membranes. these membrane-
anchored functional dna nanodevices can be likely used for the generation of
artificial signaling pathways, analytical and biophysical characterization of

bacterial membranes, structural regulation, and therapy.
we finally asked if itis possible to use these lipid-dna conjugates to distinguish
target bacteria in a more complex cell system. we realized that itis still difficult
in using just a single lipid-dna conjugate for this purpose, instead, a pattern-
based bacterial detection using a simple array of lipid-dna conjugates may be

 

feasible. to test thi:

 

idea, we wondered if a pair of two lipid-dna conjugates
can be enough to distinguish e. coli top10, €. colibl21, c. glutamicum, and s.

16:0-dna, all these strains can be categorized into separate clusters in a linear

s11+). more interestingly, these simple lipid-dna arrays are able to not only
distinguish bacteria from mammalian cells, but also bacteria of minor
differences, for example, s. aureus vs. methicillin-resistant s. aureus (mrsa), a
clinically important health-threating bacterial pathogen (fig. s117).‘? indeed,
these lipid-dna conjugates can be potentially used for the selective detection

of various bacterial species, including antibiotic-resistant superbugs.

selective targeting and detection of bacteria

to potentially apply these lipid-dna conjugates for membrane analysis and
regulation, we asked if these membrane-anchored dnas remain to be
accessible for hybridization. to test this, after inserting fam-labelled lipid-dna
conjugates onto s. aureus and c. glutamicum cell membranes, we added a cy5-
labelled complementary dna strand (cy5-cdna). without a lipid tail, these cy5-
cdna cannot modify bacterial membranes by themselves (fig. $9). while by
hybridizing with membrane-anchored dnas, indeed, highly colocalized fam
and cy fluorescence signals can be clearly visualized on the cell membranes of
c.glutamicumand s. aureus (fig. $9 and 10+). asa control, when non-
complementary dna was added, only the fam signal can be observed on the
cell membranes of c. glutamicum (fig. 9+). these results indicated that
hybridizing with membrane-anchored dnas, indeed, highly colocalized fam
and cy fluorescence signals can be clearly visualized on the cell membranes of
c.glutamicumand s. aureus (fig. $9 and 10+). asa control, when non-
complementary dna was added, only the fam signal can be observed on the
cell membranes of c. glutamicum (fig. 9+). these results indicated that
membrane-anchored dnas are still available to hybridize with the
corresponding complementary dna strands.

we would like to also mention that in these gram-positive c. glutamicum
and s. aureus bacteria, there are some cell walls located outside of the plasma
membranes. the thickness and composition of these cell walls will likely affect
the membrane insertion efficiency of these lipid-dna conjugates. some of
these lipid-dna may actually anchor directly into the cell walls. indeed,

compared to cell-wall-embedded gram-negative cells, these gram-positive

 

bacteria exhibit overall higher lipid-dna modification efficiency (fig. 4).

 

to further demonstrate other potential applications of these membrane-
anchored lipid-dna conjugates, we asked if these lipid-dna conjugates can be
used for the selective detection of bacteria from a mixture. we chose to study
two bacterial mixtures, £. colibl21 + s. aureus, and e. colibl21 + toplo. these
bl21 cells have been transformed with a red fluorescent protein, rfp670, for
easy distinction. considering the bacterial membrane selectivity of these lipid~

dna conjugates (tables s2 and s3+), a fam-labelled 18:1-18:1-dna and a 18:1-
dna conjugate was respectively used to target s. aureus and top10 cells in the
mixture. indeed as expected, these conjugates can selectively modify s. aureus
and top10 cell membranes. 96% and 92% of the labeled cells were correct

target bacteria in the presence of e. colibl21 (fig. 5a).

these e, colik12 cells are known to be more hydrophilic due to the existence of
lipopolysaccharide chains on the outer membranes. 2°~“° the membrane
hydrophobicity of these e. colicells can be further reduced at low temperatures
due to the increased content of unsaturated fatty acids. *! this fact may also
explain the above-mentioned higher top10 membrane modification of 18:1-
dna at 4 °c compared to 37 °c (fig. 3a). bacterial membranes may indeed
prefer the insertion of lipid-dna conjugates of similar hydrophobicity.

we also wanted to study the effect of dna length on the bacterial membrane
modification. for this purpose, we synthesized a cholesterol-dna conjugate
based on an 80 nt-long dna oligonucleotide. after incubating this conjugate
with e. colitop10 and s. aureus cells, respectively, at 37 °c for lh, the
observed cell membrane fluorescence signal was quite similar as that of the 20

dna length on the membrane insertion efficiency may not be as dramatic as
that of the lipid moiety. efficient membrane insertion of both short and long

our next goal is to study how these lipid-dna conjugates can modify bacterial
membranes with different selectivity. we wondered if the difference in these
membrane insertion efficiency is due to different hydrophobicities of the lipid
dna conjugates. the hydrophobicity of each lipid-dna conjugate has been
quantified using an hplc assay. °° we realized that more hydrophobic lipid-
dna conjugates, such as 18:1-18:1-dna and 18:0-18:0-dna, tend to insert onto

membrane modification efficiency of lipid-dna conjugates

our next goal is to quantify the bacterial membrane insertion efficiency of
these lipid-dna conjugates. we realized that the membrane densities of lipid-
dna conjugates can be tuned based on their initial concentrations during the
incubation. by incubating 0.1-2 um of lipid-dna conjugates with the same
density of e. colitop10, s. aureus, and c. glutamicum cells, brighter bacterial
membrane signal was generally induced with a higher initial concentration of
the conjugates (fig. s6+). when adding 16:0-16:0-dna onto s. aureus cells,
there was even a linear correlation (fig. sb +). the maximum membrane

insertion was normally observed after adding 0.5-1 1m of lipid-dna

 

conjugates.

to further study the correlation between the membrane density of lipid-dna
and the observed fluorescence intensity, we prepared 1,2-dilauroyl-sm-glycero-
3-phosphocholine (dlpc)-based supported lipid bilayers containing different

insertion was normally observed after adding 0.5-1 1m of lipi
conjugates.

to further study the correlation between the membrane density of lipid-dna
and the observed fluorescence intensity, we prepared 1,2-dilauroyl-sm-glycero-
3-phosphocholine (dlpc)-based supported lipid bilayers containing different
concentrations of lipid-dna conjugates. li

 

|-dna conjugates can be
homogenously distributed on these supported lipid bilayers. under the same
imaging condition as that for the bacterial membrane studies, a linear
correlation between the membrane fluorescence intensity and lipid-dna
density was observed (fig. s7b +). based on this standard calibration curve, we
can now quantify the bacterial membrane insertion efficiency of each lipid
dna conjugate.

1? area can be inserted at

on c. glutamicum membranes, up to 0.7 dna per nm
37°c with the help of the 16:0-16:0-dna conjugate. similarly, the highest dna
density on s. aureus membranes was 0.6 nm“? when 1 um of 18:0-18:0-dna
was added for 1 h at 37 °c (table $3). in comparison, the maximum dna
modification on e. coli top10 membranes was achieved at 4°c (0.4 nm“),

rather than 37°c (0.2 nm“), with the addition of 1 um 18:1-dna conjugate

 

(table $3+). indeed, the lipid-dna conjugates can be efficiently modified onto
bacterial membranes. meanwhile, on each type of these bacterial membranes,

efficiency was observed on these e. coli top10, s. aureus, and c. glutamicum
cells.

we next asked if the membrane insertion kinetics is influenced by the
incubation temperature. to test this, we repeated the above-mentioned kinetic
measurement at 4 °c. similar as that of 37 °c, very fast membrane insertion was
observed, with half maximum fluorescence shown at 7-20 min and 90% of
maximum signal exhibited at 25-60 min. interestingly, for the e. coli top10
cells, a faster membrane insertion and higher maximum fluorescence signal

was shown at 4°c (fi

 

a). while in contrast, for s. aureusand c. glutamicum,
a lower insertion kinetics and efficiency was observed at 4 °c than 37°c (fig. 3b
and c). as shown in the following section, we believe this difference in the
bacteria-specific temperature effect is likely due to different hydrophobicities
of these membranes. temperature can affect the membrane insertion of the
lipid-dna conjugates.

we also wondered if these lipid-dna conjugates can stay on these bacterial

membranes for a long time. by elongating the incubation time, on the top10

 

cell membranes, the fluorescence signal of 18:1-dna was shown to be
decreased by ~50% after ~90 min incubation at 37 °c. while at 4°c, a much
higher membrane probe density and persistence was observed, with only a
~30% reduction in fluorescence after 2 h incubation (fig. 34). interestingly, the

16:0-1

 

dna conjugate was highly stable on both s. aureusand c.
glutamicum membranes. even after 24 h incubation at 37 °c, ~40-50% of the
conjugate was still on these cell membranes (fig. 3e and f). these highly stable
modifications can be potentially useful for long-term membrane analysis and
~30% reduction in fluorescence after 2 h incubation (fig. 34). interestingly, the
1620-16:

 

dna conjugate was highly stable on both s. aureusand c.
glutamicum membranes. even after 24 h incubation at 37 °c, ~40-50% of the

regulations.

after demonstrating the bacterial membrane insertion of these lipid-dna
conjugates, we wanted to further characterize and understand these
modification behaviors. first, we studied the membrane insertion kinetics of
these lipid-dna conjugates. we chose to measure the insertion kinetics of 18:1-

dna onto e. coli top10 cells and that of 16:0-1¢

 

dna onto s. aureusand c.
glutamicum cells. this choice of lipid-dna conjugates is based on their high
modification efficiency (fig.3 and $3-s5+). our results indicated that within 5
min, clear membrane fluorescence signals can be observed on all these three
types of bacteria (fig. s3-s5 +). when incubated at 37 °c, half maximum
fluorescence intensity was shown at ~5 min, 17 min, and 20 min for the top10,
glutamicum cells. this choice of lipid-dna conjugates is based on their high

data, lipid-dna conjugates can rapidly insert onto bacterial membranes.

indeed, different gram-positive bacterial species can also be modified

distinctly with these lipid-dna conjugates (fig. 2b and.c).
after purification and validation, we first asked if these lipid-dna conjugates
can be inserted onto the membranes of gram-negative escherichia coli (e. coli)
cells. we chose two commonly used e. colistrains: a k-12 strain, toplo, and a b
strain, bl21. after incubating 1 4m of each lipid-dna conjugate with the cells
for lh at 37 °c and washing away free conjugates, cell membrane fluorescence
signal was imaged with a confocal microscope. as shown in fig. 1b, among,
these conjugates, the 18:1-dna exhibited obvious fluorescence signals on most
(74%) top10 cell membranes ( fig. 1c and table 2+). while the 18:0-18:0 and
18:1-18:1-based conjugates can modify 25% and 28% of the top10 cells,

respectively. there are some clear cell-to-cell variations in the membrane

 

modification efficiency. these variations among individual cells can be due to
their differences in the membrane compositions, phases of growth,
aggregation status, etc. all other lipid-dna conjugates have minimal
modification (3-12%) on both top10 and bl21 cell membranes (fig. 1c and
s17). asa control. the dna oligonucleotide itself will not be inserted onto the
modification efficiency. these variations among individual cells can be due to
their differences in the membrane compositions, phases of growth,

modification (3-12%) on both top10 and bl21 cell membranes (fig. 1c and
s1+). asa control, the dna oligonucleotide itself will not be inserted onto the
bacterial membranes (fig. $1).

we also used super-resolution structured illumination microscopy to further
confirm that the observed fluorescence signal was indeed from the bacterial
cell surfaces (fig. s2a‘t). to study if these lipid-dna conjugates are located in

the outer or inner membranes, we added 30% sucrose-contai

 

1g m9 medium
to induce plasmolysis of these dna-modified e. colicells. plasmolysis results in
the shrinkage of bacterial cytoplasm, which further leads to the separation of
the inner and outer membranes. indeed, using dil-c12 to specifically label the
inner cytoplasmic membrane of e. coli,>* we can clearly visualize the cellular
shrinkage and internalized dil-c12 fluorescence signal after treating with 30%
sucrose (fig. s2b‘). in contrast, under the same condition, the fluorescence of,
18:1-dna conjugate stayed on the membranes, indicating these lipid-dna

conjugates are located on the outer membranes of e. colicells (fig. s2bt).

 

we also studied the membrane insertion of these lipid-dna conjugates onto
another type of gram-negative bacteria, pseudomonas aeruginosa (p.
aeruginosa). however, none of these conjugates can be modified on the p.
18:1-dna conjugate stayed on the membranes, indicating these lipid-dna

we also studied the membrane insertion of these lipid-dna conjugates onto
another type of gram-negative bacteria, pseudomonas aeruginosa (p.
aeruginosa). however, none of these conjugates can be modified on the p.
aeruginosa membranes (<1%, table $2). our data indicated that the
membrane insertion of lipid-dna conjugates has specific preference on the

bacterial species.

 

next, we also asked if these lipid-dna conjugates can be inserted onto the
membranes of gram-positive bacteria, such as corynebacterium glutamicum
(c. glutamicum), staphylococcus aureus (s. aureus), and micrococcus luteus (m.
luteus). after 1 h incubation, three types of lipid-dna conjugates, 18:0-18:0,
18:1-18:1, and 16:0-16:0, can efficiently modify the membranes (80-94%, table

s21) of both c. glutamicum and s. aureus (fig. 2). in contrast, the cholesterol-

 

dna conjugate can be selectively inserted onto c. glutamicum membranes,
while the 18:1-dna conjugate prefers s. aureus. there is no lipid-dna
conjugate in the library that can modify m. luteus cells though (table $2).
indeed, different gram-positive bacterial species can also be modified

distinctly with these lipid-dna conjugates (fig. 2b and.c).

design and bacterial membrane insertion of lipid-dna
conjugates

to study the effect of lipid structures on the bacterial membrane insertion
efficiency, we first synthesized a library of lipids containing cholesterol and five
other lipids of different fatty acid chain number, length, and degree of
saturation (fig. 1a). cholesterol was chosen because it is one of the most
popular lipids used for modifying dnas onto mammalian cells. 1729 each of
these lipids was conjugated with a fluorescein amidite (fam)-labeled 20-
nucleotide (nt)-long dna strand through standard phosphoramidite chemistry.
this dna strand has been designed to have no secondary structure to minimize

potential interactions with the bacterial membranes (table s1+).

as another promising functional unit, surprisingly, dna has rarely been used
for bacterial membrane engineering.® dna can form highly precise and
programmable self-assembly and well-defined nanostructures. a large variety

our goal in this study is to provide a simple and efficient approach to
functionalize dnas onto bacterial cell membranes, with the hope of achieving
similar level of versatile decoration, biosensing, and therapy as that on the
mammalian cell membranes. different methods have been developed to
engineer bacterial membranes, including metabolic labeling, chemical cross-
linking, and hydrophobic insertion. 2:24 for example, a number of dna aptamer
molecules have been identified to selectively recognize specific bacterial
membrane targets and further used for the pathogen detection. 2°28 however,
the membrane modification efficiency and affinity of these aptamers are often
limited. in addition, the identification of aptamers for many bacterial strains is
still challenging with the current time-consuming and labor-intensive
screening process. considering the straightforward procedure of hydrophobic

insertion,

oligonucleotides onto bacterial membranes just by adding a hydrophobic
moiety, such as lipids.

attracted great interest due to their simple procedure, fast insertion, and high
efficiency. 2233 nevertheless, considering the inherent differences in the
membrane composition of bacterial and mammalian cells, lipid-dna
conjugates that have been tested on mammalian cell membranes may not
function similarly on bacterial membranes. we hope to demonstrate here that
by fine-tuning the hydrophobic lipid moieties, these lipid-dna conjugates
could be also potentially used for bacterial membrane engineering.

in this study, we constructed a library of lipids, with different structure and
hydrophobicity, to conjugate with dna oligonucleotides. interestingly, the
membrane insertion efficiency of these lipid-dna conjugates is highly
dependent on the bacterial species, and even the strains. selective bacterial
membrane modification can be achieved based on the choice of lipid moieties.

the detection of various target bacteria, including methicillin-resistant

with highly precise self-assembly and programmability, dna has been widely
used as a versatile material in nanotechnology and synthetic biology. recently,
dna-based nanostructures and devices have been engineered onto eukaryotic
cell membranes for various exciting applications in the detection and
regulation of cell functions. while in contrast, the potential of applying dna
nanotechnology for bacterial membrane studies is still largely underexplored,
which is mainly due to the lack of tools to modify dna on bacterial membranes.
herein, using lipid-dna conjugates, we have developed a simple, fast, and
highly efficient system to engineer bacterial membranes with designer dna
molecules. we have constructed a small library of synthetic lipids, conjugated
with dna oligonucleotides, and characterized their membrane insertion
properties on various gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. simply after
incubation, these lipid-dna conjugates can be rapidly and efficiently inserted
onto target bacterial membranes. based on the membrane selectivity of these
conjugates, we have further demonstrated their applications in differentiating

bacterial strains and potentially in pathogen detection. these lipid-dna
