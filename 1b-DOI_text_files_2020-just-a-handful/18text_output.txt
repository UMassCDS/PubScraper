quantification of heparin by high-performance liquld chromatography (hplc)

glycosaminoglycan-based materials such as heparin can be identified using various chromatographic methods such as hplc
[25,27-29], uplc [30], and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (lc/ms) [31,32]. heparin is a strongly negatively charged
substance [25,27-29]. when using reverse phase chromatography, heparin is first separated from the column by binding to a
polar mobile phase. in this study, the small intestines contained the largest amount of heparin in 1 g of extracted heparin, and
a relatively small amount of heparin was identified in the heart and stomach. this indicates that a high purity heparin is
extracted in the small intestine and a low purity heparin is extracted in the heart and stomach. the statistical analysis,
confirmed that there was a significant difference in the amount of pure heparin by enzyme in each by-product. as a result,
high purity heparin can be obtained using trypsin is higher than the others in the liver, lungs, heart, and small intestine. in the
large intestine, papain is higher than the others. in the stomach, heparin of similar purity was obtained by the three enzymes.
the average amount of heparin extracted by enzymes was confirmed in the order of trypsin is greater than or equal to papain,
alkaline-ak (figs. 7a and 78).

coatest heparin assay quantifies the units of heparin. heparin is analyzed in the form of a complex with anti-thrombin
present in the sample. the units/mg of extracted heparin were similar in almost all pig by-products, but heparin extracted
from the stomach was found to contain the highest amount of heparin at an average of 2,670 units/mg. the liver showed
significant differences in units extracted by enzymes, in the order of alkaline-ak and papain greater than trypsin. in the case of,
the other by-products, there was a difference in the amount of extracted enzymes but there was no significant difference
because the standard deviation was too large (figs. 8a and 88). however, the average amount of enzyme in the total by-
products was in the order of papain and alkaline-ak greater than trypsin. it is assumed that the difference in the amounts of
heparin in the same sample may be due to the proteolytic action of trypsin (serine peptidase) and papain (cysteine peptidase)

measurement of angiotensin |-converting enzyme inhibitory activity

studies on the antihypertensive activity of heparin have been conducted since the 20th century. heparin inhibits the
production of angiotensin by renin [12], and suppresses aldosterone secretion [11,13], and therefore is antihypertensive.
based on the previous studies, an experiment was conducted to confirm whether heparin extracted through an ace inhibitory
activity assay has antihypertensive activity that inhibits the production of angiotensin il (fig. 9). heparin extracted with papain
had the highest antihypertensive activity (72.5%) and extracted heparin showed higher antihypertensive activity in alkaline-ak
and trypsin (fig. 10). based on the results of the coatest heparin assay, it can be inferred that the treatment containing the
highest amount of heparin showed higher ace inhibitory activity.

measurement of antimicrobial activity

in the case of s. aureus, 2 mg/ml heparin was added to a medium containing an initial bacterial count of 1.21 x 103 cfu/ml.
heparin extracted by papain and alkaline-ak were shown to have an antimicrobial activity at low concentration (fig. 11).
however, in the case of l. monocytogens, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa, all the treatments in the samples cultured for 12 h did not
grow compared to the control, but an antibacterial effect of heparin was not found (fig. 11). as a result, the antimicrobial
activity of the extracted heparin could not be confirmed and the regularity of the antimicrobial activity treatment by
concentration could not be confirmed. these results suggest that there is no antibacterial activity of heparin against p.
aeruginosa, or that the antimicrobial activity was not exhibited by using an excessive concentration of bacteria (fig. 11).

heparin can be extracted from pig by-products, and is used in the medical fields for anticoagulant purposes. heparin, which
has been commercialized in the past, was limited to extractions from the pig small intestine, and heparin in other pig by-
products was not utilized. various studies have been conducted to reduce the disposal cost of the discarded pig by-products
and further industrialize them [1]. the current study carried out experiments on the extraction, quantification, and validation

products was not utilized. various studies have been conducted to reduce the disposal cost of the discarded pig by-products
and further industrialize them [1]. the current study carried out experiments on the extraction, quantification, and validation
of heparin. in this study, heparin was extracted from not only the small intestine (as is usually done), but also from six other
major pig by-products. using various types of proteolytic enzymes (papain and alkaline-ak), it was confirmed that heparin
extraction could be similar to or greater than that of conventional enzyme extractions (trypsin), but using inexpensive and high
titer enzymes. the above findings confirm that heparin can be extracted by a faster and simpler extraction method than the
existing extraction method, and can verify the amount of heparin contained in the pig by-product. heparin was purified
immediately after extraction and subjected to quantitative analysis to confirm the amount. as a result of measuring the purity
of extracted heparin by hplc, extracted heparin from each enzyme showed similar purity. among them, heparin extracted
from the liver and small intestine were shown to have the highest purity. the coatest heparin assay, which measures the
units of heparin, indicated the highest extractions of heparin from the liver and heart. based on the total amount of liver, it
was confirmed that pa-h (heparin extracted using papain) and ak-h (heparin extracted using alkaline-ak) contained more units
than tr-h (heparin extracted using trypsin).

ace inhibitory activity and antimicrobial activity were measured to verify the efficacy of the extracted heparin. in the ace
inhibitory activity experiment, the activities were confirmed in the order of pa-h, ak-h, and tr-h. this was similar to the units of
extracted heparin analyzed by the coatest heparin assay. based on these results, it could be assumed that high heparin
content confers ace inhibitory activity. the antimicrobial activity of heparin (according to heparin units) was confirmed in s.
aureus. no distinct antimicrobial activity was found against l. monocytogenes, e. coli, and p. aeruginosa, which may require
further investigation.

the results of this study are summarized as follows:

1. the use of crude fat and protein generated during heparin extraction shortens the extraction time, and enzyme
differentiation improved the efficiency of heparin extraction from pig by-products.

2. data were presented to indicate the amount of heparin per pig by-product. the average amount of extracted heparin per

the results of this study are summarized as follows:

1. the use of crude fat and protein generated during heparin extraction shortens the extraction time, and enzyme
differentiation improved the efficiency of heparin extraction from pig by-products.

2. data were presented to indicate the amount of heparin per pig by-product. the average amount of extracted heparin per
kilogram of pig by-product was 439 mg from the liver, 127 mg from the lung, 398 mg from the heart, 261 mg from the
stomach, 197 mg from the small intestine, and 239 mg from the large intestine.

3, various enzymes were used to extract heparin, and the amount of extracted heparin was similar. based on the major pig
by-products (from one pig), trypsin, papain, and alkaline-ak enzymes extracted 1,718 mg, 1,697 mg, and 1,905 mg heparin,
respectively.

4, heparin showed antihypertensive activity and antimicrobial activity against s. aureus, and confirmed the possibility as a
material to prevent or suppress disease.

for industrialization and mass production of heparin, it is important to establish a low-cost extraction process that can
secure national competitiveness. therefore, in this study, a method to reduce the production cost of heparin and generate
additional profits was developed by simplifying the process and using inexpensive alkaline-ak (1.3 million times cheaper than
trypsin, and 2,000 times cheaper than papain). alkaline-ak enzyme extraction can obtain similar amounts of heparin compared
to other enzymes and reduce the cost of the extraction process. extracting heparin after crude fat is removed can reduce the
use of enzymes and generate additional profits. heparin’s ace inhibitory activity and antimicrobial activity, which have not
been fully studied, were confirmed, confirming the potential of heparin as a drug. therefore, further investigation should be
directed here in the future.

results and discussion

pre-processing of pig by-products

‘the amount of defatted pig by-product powder was significantly different among the organs. the liver, lungs, and heart had
an average of about 19.5% of defatted-dried organ, and the stomach, small intestine, and large intestine, which are relatively
hydrated, had 10.7% of defatted-dried organs (fig. 5). the amount of defatted pig by-product powder was 420 gin liver, 162 g
in lung, 83 gin heart, 105 gin stomach, 161 gin small intestine, and 40 g in the large intestine (fig. 5) from 500 g of the pig by-
product. this accounts for about 16% of the total 6 kg of pig by-product that are left after slaughter. the defatted-dried by-
products are advantageous in delaying the decay of the by-products, thereby increasing the shelf life of the by-products, and
reducing the cost of storage by reducing the volume of the sample.

heparin extraction in pig by-products

‘the extraction rate of heparin from each by-product was based on the weight of pig by-products before manufacturing the
defatted pig by-product powder. heparin was extracted at the highest rate in the liver and heart and was relatively low in the
lung (fig. 6, table 2). these results indicate that the amount of heparin extracted from pig livers was similar to or greater than
the results from a previous study [20]. the calculated amount of heparin extracted from total pig by-products was about 1,718
mg extracted by trypsin, about 1,697 mg extracted by papain, and about 1,905 mg extracted by alkaline-ak enzyme (fig. 6,
table 2). in the conventional heparin extraction methods, proteolytic enzymes such as trypsin are used to remove proteins,
[19,20,22]. however, this study attempted to extract heparin using alkaline-ak, an industrial enzyme which is inexpensive, and
a high titer enzyme, such as papain. alkaline-ak is a proteolytic enzyme obtained by fermenting soybean meal by-products,
which is about 1.3 million times cheaper than trypsin and 2,000 times cheaper than papain. the extraction of heparin after the
acquisition of crude fat using folch | reagent seems to reduce the final heparin extraction amount, but it generates additional
benefits from the high value substances obtained in the crude fat.

this study was conducted to develop an effective heparin extraction method by using low-cost and highly effective enzymes
from six pig by-products (liver, lung, heart, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine), and analyze their bioavailability. low-
cost and highly effective enzymes (alkaline-ak and papain) and a common enzyme (trypsin) were used for the heparin
extraction. the angiotensin | - converting enzyme (ace) inhibitory activity and the antimicrobial activity of extracted heparin
were analyzed to verify their bioavailability. the average amount of heparin extracted per kilogram of pig by-products was 439
mg from the liver, 127 mg from the lung, 398 mg from the heart, 261 mg from the stomach, 197 mg from the small intestine,
and 239 mg from the large intestine. various enzymes were used to extract heparin, and the amount of extracted heparin was
similar. based on 1 g of pig by-product, the enzymes trypsin, papain, and alkaline-ak could extract 1,718 mg, 1,697 mg, and
1,905 mg of heparin, respectively. heparin extracted from pig by-products showed antihypertensive activity and antimicrobial
activity against staphylococcus aureus at low populations. these results indicated that heparin can be obtained from pig by-
products at a low cost.

introduction

despite increasing meat consumption, the use of slaughter by-products is limited owing to the increase in the volume of
imported by-products, the lack of improvement in consumer awareness, and a lack of product development [1,2]. the efficient
use of by-products from the meat production process is very important not only in reducing waste, but also in improving the
efficiency of utilization of livestock products. although the utilization rate is not high owing to a low efficiency of extraction,
there are many bioactive substances in meat by-products, such as heparin, collagen, chenodeoxycholic acid (cdca), and
ursodeoxycholic acid (udca), conjugated linoleic acid (cla) [3-5].

‘among the many bioactive substances in meat by-products, heparin is a compound carbohydrate that is an anticoagulant
(blood thinner) to prevent blood clotting [6]. it is a polysaccharide of glycosaminoglycans with a strong negative charge and is
found on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix [6]. it was also confirmed in the 1950s that the activity of anti-

‘among the many bioactive substances in meat by-products, heparin is a compound carbohydrate that is an anticoagulant
(blood thinner) to prevent blood clotting [6]. it is a polysaccharide of glycosaminoglycans with a strong negative charge and is
found on the cell surface and in the extracellular matrix [6]. it was also confirmed in the 1950s that the activity of anti-
thrombin was accelerated by heparin [7,8]. heparin is widely distributed in various tissues such as the lung, liver, blood, and
intestinal tissues of higher animals, especially in the mast cells. heparin, which is used in laboratories and clinics, is generally
extracted from the bovine heart or the small intestinal mucosa of swine, and is made into a calcium or sodium salt through
enzymatic and chemical treatment [6].

heparin is especially used for preventing of blood clotting during ventrotomy and organ transplantation, deep vein
thrombosis, or heart thrombosis that develops as a result of blood circulatory deterioration. in addition, it has many biological
functions, such as ant/-inflammatory, antithrombotic, antihyperlipidemic, and anti-arteriosclerotic properties, as well as
anticoagulant function that inhibits thrombin activity [9, 10]. previous studies have shown that heparin inhibits the production
of angiotensin by renin and inhibits aldosterone secretion, and ultimately has an antihypertensive effect [11-13]. infection and
thrombosis are the most common complications of central venous catheters. various gram-positive and negative bacteria
cause catheter-related sepsis through central venous catheter [14,15]. the antibacterial activity of heparin was confirmed in
various bacteria related to the above [14-18].

however, itis very expensive and time consuming to extract and purify heparin from pork by-products. moreover, there are
no studies comparing the amount of heparin in each pig by-product. therefore, the purpose of this study was to develop a
low- cost and highly efficient heparin extraction method in seven major pig by-products and analyze the anti-angiotensin i-
converting enzyme (ace) inhibitory activity in the extracted heparin and the antimicrobial activity against pathogenic
microorganisms.

pre-processing of pig by-products

six pig by-products (liver, lungs, heart, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine) for the extraction of heparin were
obtained from the dodram slaughter house (anseong, korea) and woo-gyeung livestock (hwaseong, korea). the pig by-
products were transported to the laboratory and cleaned with tap water and then the bronchi connection to the lungs and
esophageal connection to the stomach were severed, and the non-discharged digest inside and outside the organs was
washed. after washing, the by-products were ground using a chopper, then subdivided, and stored frozen (fig. 1).

heparin extraction in pig by-products

methods for the extraction of heparin from pig by-products were described previously by charles and scott [19-21],
freeman et al. [22], volpi [23], and sarwar [24] with modifications in order to simplify the extraction. folch | solution
(chloroform-methanol mixture, 2:1 by volume) was added to the by-product samples and homogenized using a homogenizer
(shg-15d-set, scilab-brand, seoul, korea) for autolysis. after shaking every 30 min for 3 h, the crude fat was extracted and the
solution and by-product tissues were separated. the folch | solution used in the extraction of crude fat was separated by
adding 0.88% nacl solution and left overnight. the chloroform layer (the lower layer) in which fat was precipitated was dried to

obtain crude fat. the by-product tissue was rinsed once with 250 ml of acetone, completely dried at low temperature, and
stored frozen. crude fat and protein obtained in the process of extracting heparin can be used to extract other high-value-
added materials present in pig by-products (fig. 2).

‘the method for extracting heparin from dried by-products after degreasing proceeded on the basis of the amount of dry by-
product powder. to 100 g of dried by-products, 1,460 ml of 0.5n naoh and 174 ml of saturated ammonium sulfate solution
were added and the mixture was extracted in a water bath at 60°c for 30 min. using gauze, discard the solids and collect the
solution. then, 7n sulfuric acid was added to the solution for titration to obtain a ph of 2, which formed a precipitate. this
solution was centrifuged (combi 514r, hanil scientific, gimpo, korea) at 2,691 * g for raw min to remove the precipitate. the
supernatant was extracted with 200 ml of 95% ethyl alcohol at 25°c for 20 h. the solution was centrifuged at 2,697xg for 20
