4. conclusions

in this study, a powdered omega-7 oil was created by
encapsulating macadamia oil droplets in wall materials
formed from macadamia protein isolate alone or in
combination with chitosan hydrochloride. the structure,
physicochemical characteristics, and oxidative stability of the
powders were characterized, as well as the particle
characteristics and storage stability of the rehydrated
emulsions, the moisture content, hygroscopicity, and bulk
density of the powders did not depend strongly on chc
addition. however, the incorporation of chc increased the
water-solubility and decreased the wettability and flowability
of the powders compared to using mpi alone. all of the
powders contained a polydisperse mixture of roughly
spherical microcapsules. we identified an optimum mpi/chc
of the powders compared to using mpi alone. all of the
powders contained a polydisperse mixture of roughly
spherical microcapsules. we identified an optimum mpi/chc
level of 5:1 for producing the macadamia oil microcapsules
because this gave a high encapsulation efficiency, strong
protection against lipid oxidation, and good storage stability
after rehydration. the ability to convert macadamia
powdered form may increase its use as a healthy i
and non-food applications by using mpi-chc composite
polymer as wall materials. however, further studies are
required to assess how the rehydrated emulsions will behave
in real food systems that may have different ph and mineral
contents.

fig. 5. a schematic diagram depicting the mechanism by
which mpi/chc composite polymer regulated the stability of
rehydrated macadamia oil emulsions.
at 25°c, the rehydrated emulsions formed by the mpi/chc
composite polymers at different ratio remained the same
trends with those of storage 4°c. extensive phase separation
was observed in the emulsions containing mpi alone after 7-
days storage, which became thicker throughout storage.
again, for mpi/chc=5:1, the emulsions were highly stable to
phase separation. for mpi/chc=3:1 and 1:1, however, rapid
droplet aggregation and creaming were observed during
storage, which may have been because of their propensity to
phase separation. for mpi/chc=3:1 and 1:1, however, rapid
droplet aggregation and creaming were observed during
storage, which may have been because of their propensity to
promote depletion flocculation.

 

3.7. potential mechanisms

on the basis of above results, the underlying mechanism of
improving rehydration stability is outlined in fig. 5. there are
two mechanisms can be explained by such rehydration
emulsions stabilized with mpi/chc composite polymers.
firstly, though mpi had good emulsifying ability, these
emulsions failed to maintain its initial droplet size, due to the
poor coverage of the interface by the droplets, resulting in
coalescence to form larger droplets (fig. 5a). secondly, if mpi
was modified with low chc concentration, the individual
droplet was considered to be completely protected by the
complex layer to prevent droplet bridging flocculation.
besides, some of the hydrophilic moieties were introduced to
the surface of mpi particles (fig. 5b). thus, the rehydration
emulsion has good performance for several week stability.
lastly, once the chc concentration reached at 1:1 in mpi/chc
the surface of mpi particles (fig. 5b). thus, the rehydration
emulsion has good performance for several week stability.
lastly, once the chc concentration reached at 1:1 in mpi/chc
composite polymer, the hydrophilicity largely increased and
emulsifying ability decreased. therefore, the rehydrated
emulsions destabilized by flocculation and creaming during
storage (fig. 5e).

 

   
3.6. storage ability of rehydrated emulsions

the appearance of rehydrated macadamia oil emulsions
formed by either mpi or mpi/chc was periodically recorded
regen etre ah de adee
the appearance of rehydrated macadamia oil emulsions
formed by either mpi or mpi/chc was periodically recorded
when they were stored at either 4 or 25°c for 30days (fig. 4).
at the beginning of the experiment, rehydrated emulsions all
had a uniform milky white appearance. first, we consider the
storage stability of the emulsions kept under simulated
refrigerator conditions (4°c). for mp1 alone, a thin cream
layer was seen on top of the emulsions after 14-days storage,
and this layer became thicker after 30-day storage. for
mpi/chc=5:1, the appearance of the emulsions did not
change throughout 30-day storage, suggesting they were
resistant to droplet aggregation and gravitational separation.
for mpi/chc=3:1 and 1:1, a thin water layer formed at the
bottom of the samples after 3-days, which increased in
thickness over time. for mpi alone, a thin cream layer was
seen on top of the rehydrated emulsions after 14-day storage,
and this layer became thicker and unstable after 30-day
storage. these results imply that spry-dried oil powders with
mpi/chc composite polymers increased the stability of

low concentration. li, woo, patel, and

  

‘sults imply that spry-diied oil powders with
mpi/chc composite polymers increased the stability of
rehydration in low concentration. li, woo, patel, and
selomulya (2017) reported that protein to lactose ratio in
high ratio were shown to have high stability, which is
attributed to lower surface activity as a results of high
caseinate and caseinate-lactose conjugates, providing higher
coverage at the interfaces of the macadamia oil droplets.

3.4. particle size and charge of rehydrated
emulsions

the size and charge characteristics of the rehydrated
macadamia oil emulsions were also measured (table 1). the
mean particle diameters (d3) of rehydrated emulsions first,
decreased and then increased as the chc concentration was
raised, with the smallest droplets (15.4nm) being observed at
mpi/chc=3:1. the d3 values followed a similar trend to the
d43 values. these effects can be at least partly attributed to
ifferences in the molecular structure and viscosity of the
wall materials, since these parameters impact the size of the
droplets formed during homogenization. according to
timilsena et al. (2016), the formation of complex coacervavte

 

 

wall materials, since these parameters impact the size of the
droplets formed during homogenization. according to
timilsena et al. (2016), the formation of complex coacervavte
between chia protein isolate and chia seed gum made the
outer shell more compact, thus resulting the smaller size of
microcapsules. therefore, the feed emulsion stabilized by
mpi/chc composite polymer through a compact structure
could reduce the droplet size of the rehydrate emulsion.
moreover, they may also be a result of differences in the
ability of the wall materials to prevent lipid droplet
aggregation during drying, storage, and rehydration of the
powders, however, the relatively large droplet size observed
in the rehydrated emulsions prepared from mpi|chc=1:1
may have been because the high viscosity of this system
inhibited the formation of small particles (botrel et al., 2014,
zhong et al., 2020).

 

the electrical characteristics of the rehydrated emulsions
were also determined (table 1). the ¢-potential of the
rehydrated emulsions formulated from mpi alone was
strongly negative (-27.5mv) because the ph was above the
werlratsirnetthahtee meie ve rnercpoeniauinie’ *
rehydrated emulsions formulated from mpi alone was
strongly negative (-27.5mv) because the ph was above the
isoelectric point of the macadamia proteins. conversely, it
became strongly positive (+45 to +52mv) in all the emulsions
formulated using mpi/chc. these results imply that cationic
chc molecules became attached to the external surfaces of
the oil droplets, which may have induced the increase of
mpr's surface hydrophilicity (zhong et al., 2020).

3.5. clsm of rehydrated emulsions

the location of the lipid and protein components within the
rehydrated emulsions was determined by clsm using
specific fluorescent labels (fig. 3). the proteins were stained
red using a water-soluble fluorescent dye (nile blue a) while
the lipids were stained green using an oil-soluble one (nile
red). the lipids and proteins were co-localized in the
emulsions, suggesting that the mpi or mpi/chc were
absorbed to the oil droplet surfaces (di giorgio, salgado, &
mauri, 2019). the size of the emulsion droplets observed by
microscopy followed a similar trend to that observed by light
absorbed to the oil droplet surfaces (di giorgio, salgado, &
mauri, 2019). the size of the emulsion droplets observed by
microscopy followed a similar trend to that observed by light
scattering, there was initially a decrease in particle size and
then an increase as the chc level was raised.

3.3. oxidative stability of macadamia oil powders

the stability of the microencapsulated macadamia oil to
oxidation was determined by determining the peroxide
values (pvs) when the samples were stored at 45°c for
3weeks (fig. 2). in the absence of chc, the initial powders
had relatively high pvs, which suggested that some oxidation
of the macadamia oil occurred during homogenization and/or
3weeks fig zfrrivthe absence or chu tie initial powders:
had relatively high pvs, which suggested that some oxidation
of the macadamia oil occurred during homogenization and/or
spray drying (korma et al., 2019). the pvs of this sample
remained the highest throughout storage with significantly
(p<0.05) higher than that of samples with mpi/chc
polymers, indicating that this type of wall material provided
the poorest protection against oxidation. the presence of chc
in the powders greatly improved their stability to oxidation,
with the systems containing mpi/chc=5:1 or 3:1 giving the
best protection that was <4meq/kg, and there was a little
increase (p>0.05) with the prolongation of storage time. it is
indicated that mpi/chc composites are more effective at
inhibiting the oxidation of microencapsulated oils than mpi
alone. similarly, timilsena, adhikari, barrow, and adhikari
(2016) reported that microcapsules formed from chia seed
protein/chia seed gum complexes provided better protection
against oxidation than those formed from chia protein alone.
these results suggest that the biopolymer matrices formed
around the lipid droplets during spray drying are more

sst that fhe biopolymer matrices formed
around the lipid droplets during spray drying are more
impermeable in the presence of protein/polysaccharide
mixtures than proteins alone.

 
3.1.3. hygroscopicity, wettability and solubility

the hygroscopicity impacts the quality of spray dried
powders, since the presence of water affects their chemical
stability, packing, and flowability. in particular, water
adsorption can promote caking due to bridging of
neighboring powder particles (botrel et al., 2014). the
hygroscopicity of the powders ranged from around 6.9 to 75g

 

adsorption can promote caking due to bridging of
neighboring powder particles (botrel et al., 2014), the
hygroscopicity of the powders ranged from around 6.9 to 75g
per-100g depending on the formulation (table 1). notably,
the powder with mpi/chc=5:1 had a significantly lower
hygroscopicity than the other powders (p<0.05).

wettability is related to the kinetics and extent of powder
rehydration, which is important for commercial products that
should rapidly and fully disperse. the powder composition is
expected to play an important role in wetting process (li,
woo, patel, & selomulya, 2017). the powder wettability times
ranged from around 365 to 130s depending on the
formulation. in general, the wettability time became shorter
as the chc concentration increased, possibly because of the
strong water adsorption properties of this chitosan derivative.

the water-solubility of powders is another important quality
attribute for many food and beverage applications. the
lowest water-solubility was seen for the powders prepared
from only mpi (86.5%), while the highest water-solubility was
abirsued for nang rendre bend agit ppheaibis, mruchc
lowest water-solubility was seen for the powders prepared
from only mpi (86.5%), while the highest water-solubility was
observed for powders formulated with 5:1 and 3:1 mpi/chc
ratios (around 97.0%). the reduction in water-solubility
observed when the chc level was further increased to
mpi/chc=1:1 can be explained by the reduction in
encapsulation efficiency of the macadamia oil, which led to
more surface oil in the powder that was difficult to dissolve.

 

3.1.4. bulk density and flowability

bulk density is an important property in packaging of
microencapsulated powders. the bulk densities of all the
powders were fairly similar (p>0.05), being around

0.61 g/cm’. according to previously, bulk density of a powder
was mainly affected by total solid content and inlet air
temperature (tonon et al., 2011), and known to correlate well
with its moisture content (shamaei, seiiedlou, aghbashlo,
tsotsas, & kharaghani, 2017). the moisture contents of all the
spray-dried powders were fairly similar in our study (table
1), which would account for the lack of differences in bulk
tsotsas, & kharaghani, 2017). the moisture contents of all the
spray-dried powders were fairly similar in our study (table
1), which would account for the lack of differences in bulk
density amongst them.

the hausner ratio (hr) and carr index (ci) are one of
available options as the quality assessment, which provide
information on powder flowability. the higher hr and ci
mean that the powder has higher cohesion and reduced
ability to flow freely (quispe-condori, saldafia, & temelli,
2011). the measured flow properties of all the
microencapsulated powders are summarized in table 1. the
hr value was 1.17 and the ci value was 14.5% for the mpi
samples. the addition of chc increased the hr values (1.27-
1.34) and ci values (21.3-25.4%). these results indicate that
the presence of the polysaccharides within the wall materials
reduced the flowability of the macadamia oil powders, which
agrees with earlier reports (korma et al., 2019).

3.2. morphology of macadamia oil powders

3.2. morphology of macadamia oil powders

scanning electron microscopy provided information about
the microstructures of the various powders (fig. 1). they all
contained roughly spherical particles of varying dimensions
with fairly smooth surfaces, but with a few surface
irregularities, some of the particles had dented and shriveled
surfaces, which is often seen in spray drying because of the
nature of the dynamic dehydration process (tonon et al.,
2011), ideally, particles with a smooth surface without
defects are desirable in powders because this gives better
protection to the encapsulated oils during drying process.
according to botrel et al. (2014), the microcapsules had fewer
folds and were less rough, which could be related to the
greater elasticity of the wall materials. in our previous study,
the formation of mpi/chc composite polymer could improve
the viscoelastic properties of the matrix (zhong et al., 2020).
this effects allowed surface more smoothing at the end of
drying process, or enable the powders to dry more rapidly,
thereby hindering shrinkage. in addition, a few broken
particles were observed within the powders, which allowed
drying process, or enable the powders to dry more rapidly,
thereby hindering shrinkage. in addition, a few broken
particles were observed within the powders, which allowed
us to see their internal structures. these microcapsules
consisted of a hollow core surrounding by a shell of oil
droplets embedded within a biopolymer matrix. the shell
formed by mpi alone appeared thicker than those formed at
intermediate mpi/chc ratios (5:1 and 3:1), which might be
related to the impact of protein-polysaccharide interactions
on the drying process.

3.1.2. moisture content

the powder prepared using only mpi had the highest
moisture content (4.0%), whereas the ones prepared using
mpi/chc varied from 3.4% to 3.7%, with no significant
difference (p<0.05) among them (table 1). these values fall
below the recommended maximum moisture levels (<4%) for
powders suitable for food applications (klinkesorn,
sophanodora, chinachoti, decker, & mcclements, 2006). it
has been reported that the moisture content of spray-dried
microcapsule powder was mainly affected by process
variables such as the drying air temperature and total solid
content (frascareli, silva, tonon, & hubinger, 2012). previous
microcapsule powder was mainly affected by process
variables such as the drying air temperature and total solid
content (frascareli, silva, tonon, & hubinger, 2012). previous
study also has shown that the moisture content for
microencapsulated palm oil was not affected by the type of
wall material (dian et al., 1996). this was consistent with our
study. there is little change on the moisture content of spray-
drying encapsulated macadamia oil powders with the
changes in the composition of the wall materials. however,
the moisture content of microcapsule powder encapsulated
with mpi was slightly higher than those coated with mpi/chc
composite, which could be related to the lower
microencapsulation efficiency.

the encapsulation efficiency (ee) of four microcapsules oil
powders was shown in table 1. the ee of the macadamia oil
within the powders ranged from 81.5 to 94.2%, depending on
the mpi/chc ratio. these results are consistent with the
encapsulation efficiency of canola oil (73.1 to 95.2%) within
microcapsules formulated using other protein-polysaccharide
combinations (li & shi, 2018). in our study, the powders
prepared from mpi alone had a relatively good encapsulation
efficiency (87.0%), but the highest value was obtained at 5:1
mpi/chc (94.2%). these results suggest the encapsulation
efficiency can be increased by optimizing mpi biopolymer
composition. presumably, this is because the nature of the
emulsifier/wall materials used impacts the size and stability
of the lipid droplets, as well as the integrity of the

iopolymer composites formed around them (zhong et al.,
2020). thus, mpi/chc composite polymer had better
emulsifying properties and with resistance to aggregation
during spray drying, and therefore higher ee was obtained.

significantly decreased to 81.5%, even lower than that of mpi

however, with mpi/chc at the ratio of 1:1, ee was
significantly decreased to 81.5%, even lower than that of mpi

which therefore produce bigger emulsion size (zhong et al.,
2020). the larger droplet surfaces are often accompanied
with collapse during spraying, resulting in an ultimately
decrease the value of ee. the larger emulsion droplet size
was, the lower ee obtained by spring drying, which was
consistent with previously (jafari, assadpoor, bhandari, & he,
2008).

the particle size characteristics of macadamia oil emulsions,
including surface-mean (d3) and volume-mean (d43)
diameters, were measured by laser particle analyzer
(mastersizer 3000, malvern instruments ltd., worcestershire,
uk). zeta-potential was measured by electrophoresis
(zetasizer nano-zsp, malvern instruments ltd.,
worcestershire, uk) using the method described by zhu et al.
(2020), rehydrated emulsions were prepared by dispersing
1.67g macadamia oil powder in 98.33ml deionized water.
each measurement was carried out at 25°c.

the emulsion specimens were diluted in double-distilled
(dd) water at 2200rpm until an obscuration rate of 10% was
obtained. mie theory was used to interpret the scattering
patterns using refractive index values of 1.47 and 1.33 for oil
and water phases, respectively.

2.7.2. confocal laser scanning microscopy and
visual appearances

the interfacial composition of rehydrated macadamia oil
droplets was examined using confocal laser scanning
microscopy (clsm) (carl zeiss lsm710, jena, germany).
rehydrated macadamia oil emulsions were obtained by
dissolving 2.0g of macadamia oil powder in 50ml of
deionized water (80°c). two hundred microliters of samples
for clsm images were stained with a mix of 0.1% nile blue a
(to stain protein) or/and 0.1% nile red (to stain oil phase) in
the dark, and thereafter loaded on a concave slide, followed
by covering them with coverslips. the fluorescent dyes in the
rehydrated macadamia oil emulsions were analyzed using
two laser excitation sources (488nm and 633nm) and two
reception channels for nile blue a and nile red, respectively
(xi, liu, mcclements, & zou, 2019).

2.8. statistical analysis

all experiments were performed in triplicate and data was
presented as the mean:standard deviation (sd). statistical
analysis was carried out by using the spss version 20.0
software. one-way analysis of variance (anova) was used to
analyze results, with p<0.05 being considered significant.
2.4.3. hygroscopicity, wettability and solubility

hygroscopicity was measured using a minor modification of
the method reported by cai and corke (2000). dried
macadamia oil powder samples (about 1.0g) were placed in
desiccators with 25°c saturated solution of nacl (relative
humidity of 75%). after 14-days storage, the macadamia oil
powder samples were weighed, and hygroscopicity was
expressed as the amount of adsorbed moisture per 100g of
dry solids.

powder wettability was determined according to the method
reported by fuchs et al. (2006). briefly, 0.1 oil powder
samples were scattered off the surface of 100ml of deionized
water in a 200ml beaker at 25°c without agitation. the time
was recorded until the last oil powder particles were
submerged in water, and used for relative comparison of
wettability extent among the powders.

the solubility of the microcapsules was evaluated at 25°c

the solubility of the microcapsules was evaluated at 25°c
with the method proposed by botrel, de barros fernandes,
borges, and yoshida (2014) with some modifications. briefly,
a powder sample (5.0g) was weighed and slowly added into a
50ml beaker containing 40ml distilled water and was stirred
at 200rpm for 15s. after all the samples were added, the
stirring was increased to 1500rpm for 3min. the samples was
then transferred to centrifuge tubes (50ml) and centrifuged
at 2000%g for 10min. an aliquot (10ml) of the supernatant
was transferred to a petri dish and oven dried at 105°c for 4h
to a constant weight. the water solubility was calculated as
the ratio of the mass of solids in the supernatant to the mass
of the samples.

2.44. bulk density and flowability

the bulk density and flowability of macadamia oil powder
samples were measured using a method described by tatar,
tunc, dervisoglu, cekmecelioglu, and kahyaoglu (2014) with
a minor modification. briefly, the bulk density (ppuix) of the
dried powders was determined by measuring the weight of
tunc, dervisoglu, cekmecelioglu, and kahyaoglu (2014) with
a minor modification. briefly, the bulk density (ppuix) of the
dried powders was determined by measuring the weight of
10ml of non-compacted powder placed into a pre-weighed
tube. the density was expressed as grams per milliliter by
iding the mass of the sample to the volume of the
samples. the tapped density (prappea) was measured after the
samples had been tapped gently by hand on a bench for 180
times.

 

the flowability was determined in terms of the carr index
(cl) and hausner ratio (hr) according to korma et al. (2019).
the carr index was calculated from the bulk and tapped

densities of the powders according to the following formula:

ct =[(gtayped — poutk) /ptappea| x 100%

the hausner ratio was calculated according to the following
formula:

hr = prapped/ poutk

hr = prapped/ poutk

2.5. morphology of macadamia oil powders

the microstructure of macadamia oil powders were observed
by scanning electron microscope (sem) as described by ye et
al. (2018) with minor changes. briefly, the macadamia oil
powders were fixed onto a double-sided black carbon tape
mounted on a stainless steel stage, which was subsequently
coated with a thin conductive gold layer (<20nm) using a
sputter coater (hummer xp, anatech, ca). the morphology
was then examined using a field emission scanning electron
microscope (jsm 6701f, jeol, tokyo, japan). the microscope
was operated at 15kv with a spot size of 2.5.

2.6. oxidative stability of macadamia oil powders

were placed in closed glass containers and stored at 45°c for
3weeks to accelerate the oxidation process. the extent of

the lipids were extracted using chloroform-methanol as an
organic solvent and then the peroxide value was determined
using a spectrophotometric method. powdered samples
(0.50g) were suspended in 5ml of distilled water and stirred
for rehydration. an aliquot (1ml) of the rehydrated sample
was then placed in a 10ml glass tube followed by the
addition of sml of isooctane/isopropanol (2:1) mixture. the
resultant mixture was vortexed three times for 10s, followed
by centrifugation at 2000xg for 5min, and the upper phase
was used to measure the pv values. pvs were determined as
described by tonon, grosso, and hubinger (2011).

45min with occasionally shaking. after that, 2ml of ethanol
(95%, w/v) was added, the sample was cooled to room

process was repeated three times. finally, the collected
solvent was removed using a rotary evaporator, and the
residue was oven-dried at 105°c for 2h before weighing.

the surface oil in the powders was estimated using a recently
published method (wang et al., 2019), except that petroleum

at 852°c. macadamia oil powders were collected and stored
at 4°c before being analyzed.

1. introduction

macadamia nuts have a desirable flavor profile and are highly
nutritious as they contain several health-promoting
components including unsaturated lipids, high-quality
proteins, dietary fibers, minerals, and nutraceuticals
(jitngarmkusol et al., 2008, aquino-bolafios et al., 2017). the
components including unsaturated lipids, high-quality
proteins, dietary fibers, minerals, and nutraceuticals
(jitngarmkusol et al., 2008, aquino-bolafios et al., 2017). the
oil extracted from the macadamia nut is an important source
of palmitoleic acid (c16:1, n-7) (venkatachalam & sathe,
2006). palmitoleic acid, which is an omega-7
monounsaturated fatty acid, exhibits various biological
functions, including mediating cardiac growth, regulating
endothelium function, and proliferating pancreatic f cells
(hu, fitzgerald, topp, alam, & o'hare, 2019). therefore,
macadamia oil has potential as a healthy source o
application in functional foods or dietary supplements.
however, the limited water-solubility and chemical stability
of this oil makes it challenging to introduce into many food
matrices (fioramonti, stepanic, tibaldo, pavén, & santiago,
2019), in addition, macadamia nuts are only grown in certain
geographical locations at certain times of the year, and so
their oils must remain stable during long-term storage and
global transport. consequently, it is necessary to develop
technologies to prevent macadamia oil oxidation and to
improve its solubility and dispersion characteristics.

global transport. consequently, it is necessary to develop
technologies to prevent macadamia oil oxidation and to
improve its solubility and dispersion characteristics.

 

microencapsulation of bioactive lipids, which typically
includes emulsification and spray drying steps, can facilitate
their handling and storage, i
improve their water-dispersibility (ko¢ et al., 2015).
nevertheless, it is important to create a stable emulsified oil
and identify a suitable wall material when formulating a
successful microencapsulated product. in particular,
emulsifier and wall material selection play a key role in
determining the encapsulation efficiency, functional
attributes, and shelf life of microcapsules. macadamia protein
isolate (mpi) is a promising natural emulsifier because of its
amphipathic properties and potential for application in plant-
based vegetarian and vegan products. however, emulsions
stabilized by mpi are not typically stable because of its low
water-solubility and tendency to aggregate (sathe et al.,
2009). chitosan hydrochloride (chc), a water-soluble
derivative of chitosan, is well-known for its nontoxic,

it their oxidation, and

 

 

water-solubility and tendency to aggregate (sathé et al.,
2009). chitosan hydrochloride (chc), a water-soluble

de tive of chitosan, is well-known for its nontoxic,

 
   

jocompatible, and biodegradable properties. chc is
preferred using in the stabilization of food emulsions by
improving the functional performance of mpi because it is a
positively charged polyelectrolyte. indeed, we recently
showed that mpi/chc composites could form oil-in-water
(0/w) emulsions with better stability than those formed by
mpialone (zhong et al., 2020).

in the current study, emulsions formulation using different
mpi-to-chc mass ratios were spray dried and then their
microstructures and physicochemical properties were
analyzed. moreover, the oxidative stability and rehydration of
powdered macadamia oil were investigated. we
hypothesized that the biopolymer complexes developed in
this study would be effective at increasing the storage and
handling of macadamia oil. thus, unlike traditional
microcapsules, we only added mpi/chc to achieve self-
stabilization of rehydration emulsion without other
emulsifiet thereby facilitating their natential application as
microcapsules, we only added mpi/chc to achieve self-
stabilization of rehydration emulsion without other
emulsifier, thereby facilitating their potential application as
functional ingredients in clean-label foods.

the utilization of oils in the food industry can be facilitated
by converting into a powdered form using
microencapsulation technologies. in this study, coatings
formed from macadamia protein isolate (mpi) and chitosan
hydrochloride (chc) were assessed for their ability to
facilitate the microencapsulation of macadamia oil by spray
dried, and all encapsulation efficiency was higher than 87.0%.
the physicochemical properties of macadamia oil powders
were then characterized. in addition, changes in the particle
size, aggregation state, and creaming stability of rehydrated
emulsions were analyzed during storage. the addition of chc
significantly enhanced the water-solubility and wettability
but decreased the flowability of microencapsulated oil.
